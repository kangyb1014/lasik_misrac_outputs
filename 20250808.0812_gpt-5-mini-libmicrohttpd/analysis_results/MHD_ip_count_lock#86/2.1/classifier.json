The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_count_lock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_count_lock:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_lock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_ip_count_lock code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function uses conditional compilation to produce two alternate, reachable implementations: when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS is defined it calls MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex); otherwise it casts daemon to void to avoid an unused-parameter warning. Each branch is reachable depending on the build configuration and there is no statically unreachable (dead) code in this function.",
