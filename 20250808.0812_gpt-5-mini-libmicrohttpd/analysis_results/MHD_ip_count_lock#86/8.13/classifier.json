  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified MHD_ip_count_lock code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/691.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_count_lock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_count_lock:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_lock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_ip_count_lock:\n#define MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(pmutex) do{if(!MHD_mutex_lock_(pmutex))MHD_PANIC(_(\"Failed to lock mutex.\\n\"));\\\n}while(0)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_ip_count_lock code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function uses daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex with MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, which locks/modifies the mutex. Because the pointed-to object is modified, the pointer must not be const-qualified per Rule 8.13, so the current non-const pointer usage is appropriate.",
