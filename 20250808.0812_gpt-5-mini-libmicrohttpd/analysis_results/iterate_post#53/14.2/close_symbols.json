The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required for checking the MISRA-C for-loop well\u2011formedness rule in the context of iterate_post:\n\n- strcmp\n  - iterate_post directly calls strcmp in its conditional. Any for-loops inside strcmp's implementation (or other side-effects) would be part of the behaviour of code executed at that point. To be sure no illegal for-loops are involved you must inspect strcmp (or its implementation) for for-loops that violate the rule.\n\n- malloc\n  - allocate memory via malloc. The implementation of malloc may contain for-loops or modify global objects; these would be part of iterate_post's executed behaviour and must be checked if loop-related MISRA rules are to be enforced across called functions.\n\n- snprintf\n  - used to format into the newly-allocated buffer. snprintf's implementation may contain loops; those loops are part of the observable behaviour invoked from iterate_post and must be inspected for MISRA-compliance.\n\n- GREETINGPAGE\n  - a macro or constant used as the format string. If GREETINGPAGE is a macro that expands to code (unlikely but possible in some code bases), it could introduce loops or side effects. Its definition must be checked.\n\n- MAXANSWERSIZE\n  - used for buffer sizing. It may be a macro or constant; if it is a macro with side effects or complex expansion, that could introduce code (including loops). Also checking it helps verify buffer-size usage but primarily ensures macro expansion contains no problematic for-loops.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE\n  - same rationale as MAXANSWERSIZE: definition might be a macro or computed expression; inspect to ensure no unexpected code containing for-loops.\n\n- struct connection_info_struct\n  - iterate_post casts coninfo_cls to this struct pointer and writes con_info->answerstring. You must see the struct definition to confirm that assigning to the answerstring field has no hidden behaviour (e.g. if answerstring is a macro or if the struct type or accessors are implemented in a way that invokes functions containing for-loops). Also to know the exact type of answerstring (char* expected) and whether other fields are affected.\n\n- con_info->answerstring (field)\n  - explicitly note the field being written. If the field access is actually a wrapper/macro or if writing it triggers further code (project specific), that code must be inspected for loops.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_NO, MHD_YES)\n  - the return values used. Include the enum definition to ensure there are no hidden macros or side-effecting definitions that could expand into code containing loops.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind\n  - the type of the unused parameter 'kind'. Its definition should be checked in case it is a macro or inline function-like construct in this code base (rare), or carries attributes that change behaviour.\n\n- coninfo_cls (parameter type / provenance)\n  - the value passed as coninfo_cls may originate elsewhere in the program. To ensure no for-loop related behaviour is introduced via its construction or by aliasing, you may need to inspect the callers/provenance (how coninfo_cls is created/populated). In particular, if the pointer is to an object with unusual accessors or if casting hides side-effecting conversions, those must be checked.\n\nNotes:\n- Standard C library functions (strcmp, malloc, snprintf) are included because MISRA mandates that the behaviour of called functions is part of the called site\u2019s behaviour. If your analysis policy treats standard library implementations as trusted/black-box, you can omit their implementations, but you must document that assumption.\n- I did not include primitive typedefs (size_t, uint64_t) because they do not introduce loops or side-effects. Include them only if your code base redefines them in a nonstandard way."
