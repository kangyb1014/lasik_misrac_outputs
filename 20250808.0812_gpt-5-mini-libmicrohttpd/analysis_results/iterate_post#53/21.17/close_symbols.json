This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For deciding whether this function violates the <string.h> bounds rule you must know more than just the local code: \n\n- MAXANSWERSIZE: numeric value is required to determine the allocated buffer length and whether snprintf can ever write beyond the malloc'd buffer. The guard uses MAXANSWERSIZE in the allocation and in snprintf's size parameter.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE: numeric value is required because the code allows processing when size <= MAXNAMESIZE; you must check whether that bound, combined with GREETINGPAGE and snprintf behaviour, prevents overruns.\n\n- GREETINGPAGE: the format string (and its fixed characters besides the %s) is needed to compute the total number of bytes snprintf will attempt to write when the %s is replaced by data. If GREETINGPAGE contains other format directives or extra text, it affects required buffer size.\n\n- struct connection_info_struct (definition, esp. member answerstring): to confirm where answerstring points and how it is later used/freed; also to ensure no other code expects different sizing/ownership that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- iterate_post data parameter contract / libmicrohttpd post-processor docs: critical to know whether 'data' is a NUL-terminated C string or a raw buffer with length 'size'. If 'data' is not NUL-terminated, using %s in snprintf will read beyond the provided buffer (violating the rule) unless guaranteed otherwise.\n\n- key parameter contract (is 'key' guaranteed NUL-terminated?): strcmp(key, \"name\") assumes key is NUL-terminated. You must confirm the caller/library guarantees this to ensure strcmp does not read out-of-bounds.\n\n- snprintf semantics for %s: standard behavior (reads until NUL) and its truncation rules are needed to reason whether snprintf invocation can read beyond 'data' or write beyond answerstring. Knowing that snprintf reads a NUL-terminated source for %s shows that a non-terminated 'data' will cause overread.\n\n- strcmp semantics: to confirm that using strcmp(key, \"name\") is safe only if 'key' is NUL-terminated; include this to justify whether strcmp here could violate the rule.\n\nHaving these symbols/definitions lets an analyst compute possible read (from data/key) and write (to answerstring) bounds and determine if any <string.h> usages (strcmp, snprintf's %s) can access memory beyond the referenced objects."
