  "explanation": "- struct connection_info_struct: needed to know the type and existence of the member con_info->answerstring and whether assigning NULL or a malloced pointer has side effects or different type that could make code paths impossible.\\n- MAXNAMESIZE: the if ((size > 0) && (size <= MAXNAMESIZE)) condition depends on this constant; if it is a compile-time value (e.g. 0) parts of the block become statically unreachable.\\n- MAXANSWERSIZE: determines the snprintf buffer size and allocation intent; a compile-time value could make allocation or snprintf calls impossible or optimized away.\\n- GREETINGPAGE: the format string/macro used by snprintf; if it is defined in a way that changes control flow (for example as an expression that contains only constants or triggers compile-time errors) it can affect reachability.\\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_NO, MHD_YES): needed to know whether the two return labels are distinct values or aliases; if they are identical then some return statements or subsequent code may be semantically redundant/unreachable in context of the project.\\n- malloc (project replacement/behavior): many projects replace malloc with wrappers that abort, never return, or always succeed; such behavior would make the \"if (!answerstring) return MHD_NO;\" branch unreachable.\\n- strcmp (project replacement/behavior): if strcmp is replaced by a macro or function with different semantics (for example always returning non-zero or being folded at compile time), the outer if (0 == strcmp(key, \"name\")) may be statically true/false and make large blocks unreachable.\\n- snprintf (project replacement/behavior): if snprintf is replaced by a macro that never returns or has compile-time side effects, the code that follows it could be unreachable.\\n\\nProvide these symbols/definitions so the next analyst can determine which branches are provably unreachable under the project's actual definitions and replacements."
