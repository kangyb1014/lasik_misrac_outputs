  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA rule (no memcmp for NUL-terminated strings):\n\n- strcmp: The function in the target uses strcmp to compare key with a literal. To determine if the code violates the MISRA rule we must inspect strcmp's usage and implementation (e.g., whether it is a safe string comparison function or an alias/wrapper over memcmp).\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule explicitly forbids using memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. We must check whether memcmp is used directly in this translation unit or indirectly (for example, if strcmp is implemented in terms of memcmp). Include memcmp so analysis can detect direct or indirect use.\n\n- snprintf: The code calls snprintf to build answerstring from GREETINGPAGE and data. Confirming that snprintf is not being replaced by a wrapper that uses memcmp to compare/handle strings (or that the format usage does not rely on memcmp) is relevant to rule compliance and to confirm correct handling of NUL-termination and buffer sizes.\n\n- malloc: The code allocates MAXANSWERSIZE bytes for answerstring. Knowing malloc is necessary to reason about the allocated buffer size and whether subsequent operations could produce non-NUL-terminated data or read past boundaries (which could incorrectly lead to use of memcmp elsewhere). Also useful to inspect any project-specific malloc wrapper that might call memcmp.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE: The code tests size against MAXNAMESIZE before acting. To reason whether the 'key' comparison is safe and whether a memcmp would be inappropriate, we need the macro value to check bounds and ensure key/data handling follows NUL-termination expectations.\n\n- MAXANSWERSIZE: Needed to confirm the allocated buffer size passed to snprintf and to ensure snprintf use cannot produce non-terminated strings or overflow that could trigger use of memcmp elsewhere.\n\n- GREETINGPAGE: The format string used with snprintf; its contents (e.g., presence of %s or other format specifiers) determine how data is copied into answerstring and whether NUL-termination is preserved.\n\n- struct connection_info_struct: The code writes con_info->answerstring. The field type and semantics (char *? fixed-size array?) are required to reason about whether storing answerstring could cause later code to use memcmp incorrectly on that member.\n\n- MHD_Result, MHD_NO, MHD_YES: These control-flow/result symbols identify the function's return behavior (when it stops iteration). They are needed to understand which code paths execute (and therefore whether any path uses memcmp or might trigger code that does). Also needed for any static analysis that follows control flow into other callbacks that might use memcmp.\n\n- libmicrohttpd iterate_post callback contract (null-termination of key/data): The properties of the callback parameters (whether 'key' and 'data' are NUL-terminated, whether 'size' describes binary data) are essential. MISRA's concern is using memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings; if data or key are not guaranteed NUL-terminated, then use of strcmp itself could be incorrect and analysis must confirm correct string semantics. Also, if the API guarantees NUL-termination for key, that justifies using strcmp rather than memcmp.\n\nIn short: to determine whether this function violates the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp for NUL-terminated strings you must (1) check if memcmp is used here or via any wrapper/implementation used by strcmp/snprintf, (2) verify that strcmp is an appropriate, non-memcmp-based string comparator in this build, and (3) verify that the callback API and buffer sizes/format strings ensure NUL-terminated strings are handled correctly. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to perform those checks."
