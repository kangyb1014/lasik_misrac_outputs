  "explanation": "1) struct connection_info_struct: You must see the full definition to determine the exact type and qualifiers of the answerstring field (e.g. char * vs const char *). MISRA's const-pointer rule depends on whether the struct member is const-qualified.\n\n2) connection_info_struct::answerstring (member declaration): This is called out separately because the const qualification of that single member is the central fact needed to decide if iterate_post violates the rule (iterate_post assigns and uses the buffer). If answerstring is declared const char * but iterate_post or other functions write into the buffer, that is a MISRA violation.\n\n3) snprintf (declaration/prototype): iterate_post calls snprintf(answerstring, ... , GREETINGPAGE, data). The standard prototype shows the first parameter is char * (destination written into). You need the prototype to confirm snprintf writes into the object pointed to by answerstring \u2014 if it does, answerstring must not be const-qualified.\n\n4) All program functions that access/modify connection_info_struct->answerstring (examples: answer_to_connection, request_completed): MISRA rule also requires consideration of all functions that use that pointer. If any function elsewhere writes into *answerstring (calls snprintf/strcpy/strcat or otherwise modifies the pointed-to bytes), then the pointer must not be const-qualified. Conversely, if all users only read through the pointer, const qualification may be appropriate. To decide you need the symbols (function definitions or prototypes) for every routine in the program/static call graph that reads or writes con_info->answerstring so you can determine whether the pointed object is ever modified."
