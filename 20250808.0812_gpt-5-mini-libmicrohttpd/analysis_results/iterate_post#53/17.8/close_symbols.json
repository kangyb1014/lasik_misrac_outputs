  "explanation": "struct connection_info_struct \u2014 required to know the exact layout and types of the object pointed to by coninfo_cls. In particular, we must confirm whether answerstring is a modifiable member (e.g. a char *), not an array or something that would make the assignment semantics different. connection_info_struct.answerstring \u2014 the member being written (con_info->answerstring = ...). Knowing its type (pointer vs array) is essential to decide whether the code modifies the pointer parameter itself or only the object it points to (MISRA permits modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter but not the pointer parameter itself). MAXANSWERSIZE and MAXNAMESIZE \u2014 needed to verify the buffer allocation/size logic and to confirm that snprintf writes into the newly allocated buffer (and therefore modifies the buffer object), not into some caller-owned object that would imply modifying a parameter. GREETINGPAGE \u2014 needed to see the format string used with snprintf to ensure the write target is the allocated buffer and to reason about possible aliasing/side effects. These symbols together let an analyzer determine whether only the object referred to by the pointer parameter is modified (allowed) and that no pointer parameter itself is being assigned to or altered (forbidden by the MISRA rule)."
