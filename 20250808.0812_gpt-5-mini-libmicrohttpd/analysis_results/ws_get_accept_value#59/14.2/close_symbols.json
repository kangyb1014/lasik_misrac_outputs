The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n- SHA1Reset: need the function body/prototype to check whether it contains any for-loops (and whether those loops are well\u2011formed) called from ws_get_accept_value. \n- SHA1Input: must inspect its implementation because it is called inside ws_get_accept_value; any for-loops inside it (or their effects) are relevant to assessing compliance. \n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: SHA1Input calls this; include its body to check transitive for-loops and loop counters/side-effects. \n- SHA1Result: its implementation must be inspected for for-loops (it is called by ws_get_accept_value). \n- SHA1PadMessage: SHA1Result calls this; include it for transitive loop inspection. \n- BASE64Encode: this callee may contain for-loops that must be checked (it returns len used by caller). \n- struct SHA1Context: the type laid out/fields may determine which objects are modified inside SHA1* functions (relevant to clause 2/3 about objects modified in loop bodies). \n- SHA1HashSize: size constant used as BASE64Encode length; needed to understand loop bounds in BASE64Encode and SHA1Result implementations. \n- WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID_LEN, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN, WS_GUID: these macros/constants determine buffer sizes and the lengths passed to SHA1Input/strncpy; they can influence loop counters or be used inside any loops in called functions\u2014so include their definitions. \n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the return type/constants are needed to understand control flow and whether early returns affect loop analysis (and to give a complete context). \n- malloc, free, strlen, strncpy, ssize_t: standard prototypes/types are needed to understand side effects, return types and sizes used by the target; while their internal implementations are usually out of scope, their signatures and behaviour (e.g., return -1 from BASE64Encode using ssize_t) are required to reason about control flow and possible interactions with loops in caller/callees.\n\nIn short: include the full implementations (or prototypes plus bodies) of all direct callees and their transitive callees, the SHA1 context/type/size macros, the websocket length/GUID macros, and relevant type/stdlib symbols so the analyser can find any for-statements, verify their three clauses and check modification of loop counters or objects used in the loop bodies per the MISRA rule."
