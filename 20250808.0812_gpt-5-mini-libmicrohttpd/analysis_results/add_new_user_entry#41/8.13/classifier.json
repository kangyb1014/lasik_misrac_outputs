The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of add_new_user_entry as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_new_user_entry:\n```c\nstatic int\nadd_new_user_entry (const char *const username,\n                    const char *const password,\n                    const char *const realm,\n                    int allow_area_1,\n                    int allow_area_2)\n{\n  struct UserEntry *entry;\n  enum MHD_Result res;\n\n  if ((sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])) <= user_ids_used)\n    return 0; /* No more space to add new entry */\n\n  entry = user_ids + user_ids_used;\n\n  entry->username = username;\n  entry->realm = realm;\n\n  res = MHD_YES;\n\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res = MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5,\n                                         username,\n                                         realm,\n                                         entry->userhash_md5,\n                                         sizeof(entry->userhash_md5));\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res = MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5,\n                                           username,\n                                           realm,\n                                           password,\n                                           entry->userdigest_md5,\n                                           sizeof(entry->userdigest_md5));\n\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res = MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA256,\n                                         username,\n                                         realm,\n                                         entry->userhash_sha256,\n                                         sizeof(entry->userhash_sha256));\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res = MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA256,\n                                           username,\n                                           realm,\n                                           password,\n                                           entry->userdigest_sha256,\n                                           sizeof(entry->userdigest_sha256));\n\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res = MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA512_256,\n                                         username,\n                                         realm,\n                                         entry->userhash_sha512_256,\n                                         sizeof(entry->userhash_sha512_256));\n  if (MHD_NO != res)\n    res =\n      MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA512_256,\n                                       username,\n                                       realm,\n                                       password,\n                                       entry->userdigest_sha512_256,\n                                       sizeof(entry->userdigest_sha512_256));\n\n  if (MHD_NO == res)\n    return 0; /* Failure exit point */\n\n  entry->allow_area_1 = allow_area_1;\n  entry->allow_area_2 = allow_area_2;\n\n  user_ids_used++;\n\n  return !
