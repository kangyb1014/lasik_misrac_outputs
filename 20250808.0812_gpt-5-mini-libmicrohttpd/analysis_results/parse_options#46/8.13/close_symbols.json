  "explanation": "1) parse_options_va (declaration and full definition): parse_options simply forwards its varargs and the params pointer to parse_options_va. To decide whether params (and/or daemon) should be const-qualified in parse_options, you must know how parse_options_va is declared and implemented \u2014 specifically whether it modifies the object(s) pointed to by params or daemon, or forwards them to other functions that do so. If parse_options_va modifies the pointed object, params cannot be const; if it does not, then parse_options should be const-qualified.  \n\n2) struct MHD_InterimParams_ (complete type definition): the MISRA rule concerns pointers to objects and whether the pointed-to object is modified. You must inspect the fields and intended use of this structure to determine if operations in parse_options_va (or its callees) write into any fields. The concrete layout and semantics of the structure let you tell whether it is appropriate to declare the pointer as const.  \n\n3) struct MHD_Daemon (complete type definition): parse_options takes a daemon pointer and forwards it. Even if analysis focuses on params, parse_options_va might modify daemon or call functions that do; to be safe you need the daemon type and its writable state to decide whether that pointer could be const.  \n\n4) enum MHD_Result (definition): included to fully understand the function signatures and return values; not directly governing constness but needed to verify prototypes/signatures match between parse_options and parse_options_va.  \n\n5) <stdarg.h> / va_list, va_start, va_end semantics: parse_options is a varargs wrapper. Correct constness decisions must account for how varargs are forwarded via va_list \u2014 e.g., whether parse_options_va reads/consumes arguments in a way that requires non-const pointers to be passed. Knowing va_list semantics ensures forwarding does not alter const qualification expectations.  \n\n(If parse_options_va calls other functions that might mutate the pointed objects, include those callees as well when you inspect parse_options_va.)"
