  "explanation": "parse_options simply forwards its varargs to parse_options_va, so the only place a memcmp misuse could occur is inside parse_options_va \u2014 include its symbol (signature and body) to inspect any comparisons it performs and the types of operands (to tell if they are null\u2011terminated strings). parse_options_va calls MHD_DLOG; that callee could itself perform comparisons using memcmp, so include MHD_DLOG to inspect its implementation. Finally include the Standard Library symbol memcmp to locate all uses (call sites and how it is called) and check argument types/lengths to decide whether memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings (the MISRA C violation)."
