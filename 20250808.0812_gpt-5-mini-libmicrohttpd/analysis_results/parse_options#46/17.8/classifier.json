  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified parse_options code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/373.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of parse_options as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_options:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nparse_options (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params,\n               ...)\n{\n  va_list ap;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  va_start (ap, params);\n  ret = parse_options_va (daemon,\n                          params,\n                          ap);\n  va_end (ap);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above parse_options code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
