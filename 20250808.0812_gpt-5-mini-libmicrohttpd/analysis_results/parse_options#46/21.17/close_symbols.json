  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- parse_options_va: parse_options only forwards its va_list to this function. To determine any violation of the <string.h> bounds rule you must inspect the implementation of parse_options_va (its use of buffers, lengths and any string calls).\n- MHD_DLOG: parse_options_va calls MHD_DLOG (per the call graph). MHD_DLOG may itself perform string operations or format/concatenate strings; its body is required to see whether any string.h calls are used unsafely.\n- struct MHD_InterimParams_ (full definition): parse_options and parse_options_va operate on a params pointer; you must know the exact layout and sizes of any character buffers or length fields in this struct to judge whether string operations could access out-of-bounds.\n- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition): similarly, any pointers or buffers in the daemon structure that are referenced by parse_options_va or MHD_DLOG must be known to assess bounds.\n- enum MHD_Result (definition): to fully understand return values and control flow in parse_options_va (and whether alternate code paths perform different string ops) the enum definition is needed.\n- va_list / stdarg.h macros (va_start, va_end): although parse_options uses these correctly, confirming the exact va_list handling/ABI and that parse_options_va expects a va_list is necessary to ensure no mis-use leads to malformed arguments that in turn cause unsafe string calls.\n- Any string.h functions called by parse_options_va or MHD_DLOG: list and inspect the exact calls (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) including their argument expressions and the sizes/lengths passed; these are the direct subjects of the MISRA rule and must be examined in context.\n\nIn short: the target function itself only forwards varargs; the safety question hinges entirely on parse_options_va (and things it calls such as MHD_DLOG) plus the concrete definitions of the involved data structures and any string functions they invoke."
