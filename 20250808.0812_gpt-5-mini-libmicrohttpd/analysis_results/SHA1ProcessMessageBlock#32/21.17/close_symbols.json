This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- struct SHA1Context\n  - The function indexes into fields of this struct; the full struct definition is needed to know types and bounds of those fields.\n\n- SHA1Context::message_block\n  - SHA1ProcessMessageBlock reads message_block[ i*4 + 0..3 ] for i in 0..15 (64 bytes total). You must know the declared size and element type of message_block to determine whether these indexed accesses are within bounds and thus whether any string.h calls elsewhere could have corrupted it.\n\n- SHA1Context::message_block_index\n  - This field is written at the end (set to 0). Its type and valid range are needed to check for possible out-of-bounds uses elsewhere that could affect subsequent indexing here.\n\n- SHA1Context::intermediate_hash\n  - The function reads and updates intermediate_hash[0..4]; you need its declared length/type to verify those accesses are safe.\n\n- SHA1CircularShift (function)\n  - Called repeatedly; its prototype and definition are needed to ensure it has no side effects (e.g. memory writes) that could affect buffers or violate the string.h rule, and to confirm it does not use string.h functions itself.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage\n  - A direct caller of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock. To determine whether any string.h functions are used on the same context buffers (message_block, etc.) or could cause out-of-bounds accesses before or after SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is invoked, you must inspect SHA1PadMessage's implementation.\n\n- SHA1Input\n  - Another direct caller. It likely accumulates input into message_block; you must inspect it for uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* that might write beyond message_block bounds or otherwise interact with the buffer accesses in SHA1ProcessMessageBlock.\n\n- SHA1Result\n  - Caller of SHA1PadMessage. Include it because it may call string.h functions or otherwise interact with SHA1PadMessage/contexts; tracing callers can reveal indirect uses of string functions that affect the buffers processed by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value\n  - Caller of SHA1Input (per call graph). Include it because it may perform string.h operations (e.g. memcpy/strlen) on data passed into SHA1Input, which could propagate out-of-bounds conditions into the SHA1 context buffers.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule concerns standard string.h functions causing out-of-bounds accesses. Although SHA1ProcessMessageBlock itself does not call string.h, callers or other functions (and the exact sizes/types of the struct fields) determine whether accesses performed here are safe or whether prior/parallel string.h use could produce out-of-bounds conditions. Therefore the struct field definitions, the circular-shift helper, and the direct and indirect callers must be inspected."
