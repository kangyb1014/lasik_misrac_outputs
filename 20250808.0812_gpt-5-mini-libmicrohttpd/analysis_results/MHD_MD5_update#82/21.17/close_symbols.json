  "explanation": "For each symbol:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx: The analysis must know the exact size and type of ctx->buffer (the memcpy destination) and the type/width of ctx->count (used to compute bytes_have). Buffer size determines whether writes of bytes_left or length can exceed the buffer bounds; count's type affects the masking operation and index range.\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: The code computes bytes_have = (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1)) and bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have and uses MD5_BLOCK_SIZE as the unit for memcpy and md5_transform. The concrete numeric value is required to prove that copies are bounded by the buffer size.\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Presence or absence changes control flow (early return on length==0). Whether this macro is defined in the analyzed build affects whether memcpy can be reached with length==0 and whether mhd_assert is relied upon alone to prevent invalid accesses.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion expression ((data != NULL) || (length == 0)) is present, but whether it aborts, is a no-op, or otherwise enforces the condition depends on mhd_assert's definition in the build. To determine if memcpy can be invoked with data==NULL and length>0 (which would violate the rule), you need to know mhd_assert behavior.\n\n- md5_transform: Although md5_transform is not a string.h call, it is called with ctx->buffer and may have assumptions/side-effects related to buffer contents/size. Its contract (whether it reads exactly MD5_BLOCK_SIZE bytes, whether it modifies buffer, etc.) is relevant to reasoning about valid use of ctx->buffer and whether prior memcpy provides the required amount of data.\n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>): The MISRA rule targets use of these standard functions. Knowing the exact semantics required by the standard library implementation (e.g., preconditions on source/destination validity and overlap behavior) is necessary to show compliance.\n\n- typedefs uint8_t and size_t: These types determine pointer arithmetic, cast behaviors, and size ranges for length and buffer indexing. size_t width affects arithmetic on ctx->count and length.\n\n- digest_update and its callers: To prove the source pointer and length passed into MHD_MD5_update are valid (i.e., memcpy's source 'data' points to an object at least 'n' bytes long whenever length>0), you must examine callers that supply those arguments. The caller chain listed in the static call graph (digest_update and its callers) is needed to establish calling-site invariants (non-NULL data when length>0, correct length bounds) that affect whether memcpy accesses beyond object bounds.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and build-time macro settings) lets an analyst determine the sizes and invariants required to check that each memcpy call in MHD_MD5_update cannot access outside the objects referenced by its pointer parameters, as required by the MISRA rule."
