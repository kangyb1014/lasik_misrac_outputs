The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect any macro/inline/function used in the target function because a for-loop introduced by a macro or inline expansion inside this function would be a for in the target function and therefore subject to the MISRA requirement. For each symbol:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition and fields memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size): needed to know whether any of these fields are implemented as expressions/macros (or have side effects) and to confirm there is no hidden loop control variable stored in the structure.\n- mhd_assert: typically a macro; its expansion may contain statements (even loops) or modify program state \u2014 must be inspected to ensure it does not introduce a for loop or side effects affecting loop counters.\n- malloc / free: normally library calls, but on some platforms these may be macros or inline wrappers; verify they do not expand to for loops or side-effectful code that would count as part of any for body.\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: likely a macro used to initialize memory; it may contain loops (e.g. a memset-like loop). If it expands to a for loop, that for would be inside the target function and must comply with MISRA.\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN and ALIGN_SIZE: macros or constants used in arithmetic and in the assert \u2014 if they are macros they might expand into expressions containing loops or side effects; must be examined.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: symbol or macro used in size computation; if implemented as a macro or function with side effects, it could introduce loop-related behaviour.\n- MAP_FAILED, MAP_ANONYMOUS, _WIN32 (preprocessor symbol): these control which code path is compiled. Different paths include different macros/calls; the analyzer must consider all relevant conditional branches (and their macros) because a for loop could be present in a branch.\n- mmap / VirtualAlloc and their flags (PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE): normally external API calls, but wrappers or platform-specific headers could provide inline implementations or macros. Inspect to ensure they do not expand into for loops or introduce side effects that would be considered part of a for-body.\n- uintptr_t, size_t, bool / false / true: basic type/boolean definitions to confirm that any assertions or casts do not hide macro expansions with loops or side effects.\n\nIn short: focus first on all macros used in this function (_MHD_POISON_MEMORY, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ALIGN_SIZE, mhd_assert and any platform-specific macros), plus the MemoryPool type definition. Any macro/inline that expands into a for loop or that mutates a loop counter would create a for loop inside this function and must be checked against the MISRA rule. External library calls (malloc, mmap, VirtualAlloc) should be checked only if they are macros or inlined in the translation unit."
