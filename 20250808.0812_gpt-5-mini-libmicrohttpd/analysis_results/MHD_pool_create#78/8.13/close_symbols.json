  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C pointer-const analysis:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition)\n  - The field types and qualifiers inside struct MemoryPool are central: in particular the type and any const-qualification of the memory member (e.g. void *memory vs const void *memory), and types of is_mmap/pos/end/size. The MISRA rule concerns whether pointers should be const-qualified; you must inspect the struct member declaration to know if the pointer is already const or not.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (declaration/definition)\n  - This function/macro is called with pool->memory and pool->size. To decide whether pool->memory should be const-qualified you must know whether _MHD_POISON_MEMORY writes to the pointed memory (its parameter type and semantic). If it modifies the memory (takes void * or non-const pointer and writes), the pointer must not be const.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro or function)\n  - Used to compute alloc_size and subsequently assigned to pool->memory via malloc. Knowing its effect and type is needed to ensure size computations are correct and to check whether any conversions could force a different pointer qualification (less likely but included for completeness).\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE (macro or constant)\n  - Used in the assertion that checks alignment: the expression uses ALIGN_SIZE and a cast to uintptr_t. The constant's meaning and type are relevant when checking the cast and whether pool->memory is used in contexts that require pointer-to-const or pointer-to-modifiable memory.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_ (variable)\n  - Used to decide whether to use mmap/VirtualAlloc and to compute alloc_size. Its type (size_t or similar) is needed for the arithmetic and to ensure no implicit conversions affect pointer qualifiers.\n\n- MAP_FAILED (macro)\n  - The code compares pool->memory to MAP_FAILED to determine whether allocation via mmap/VirtualAlloc succeeded. MAP_FAILED is typically ((void *) -1); its type/definition matters for checking compatibility with the declared type of pool->memory (const vs non-const) and whether comparisons produce any qualification issues.\n\n- mmap (declaration)\n  - mmap returns a pointer (void *). To reason about whether pool->memory must be modifiable you must know mmap's return type and semantics (it yields writable memory when called with PROT_WRITE). If it returns void * (non-const) and the returned memory is written to later, pool->memory should not be const.\n\n- VirtualAlloc (declaration)\n  - Same reason as mmap on Windows: Declaration/semantics (returns void */LPVOID and provides writable memory) inform whether pool->memory must be non-const.\n\n- malloc (declaration)\n  - malloc returns void *. Knowing the prototype confirms that assigning its result to pool->memory does not require const qualification; also useful to check whether pool->memory is expected to be writable after allocation.\n\n- free (declaration)\n  - free takes a void *; its prototype helps check whether pool is freed correctly and whether passing pool->memory or pool to free implies a particular pointer qualification.\n\n- uintptr_t (typedef)\n  - Used in the alignment cast. Knowing the typedef ensures the cast and arithmetic are well-typed and do not impose any const-related constraints.\n\nIn short: the decisive facts for the MISRA pointer-const rule here are the exact declaration of struct MemoryPool->memory (is it const-qualified or not) and the declarations/semantics of functions that operate on that memory (notably _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, mmap/VirtualAlloc, malloc, and free). The other symbols (ALIGN_SIZE, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, MHD_sys_page_size_, MAP_FAILED, uintptr_t) are needed to verify type/qualification compatibility in comparisons, casts and size calculations that could affect whether a const qualification is permissible."
