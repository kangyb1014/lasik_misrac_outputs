  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can cause out-of-bounds accesses by string.h routines (memset/memcpy/etc.), the next analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The exact layout and types of the fields (especially the type of pool->memory and the meaning/types of pool->size, pool->end and pool->pos and pool->is_mmap) are required to check that any memory operations use the correct pointer/size and to ensure the size passed to any string/memory function matches the allocated object.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: This symbol is the only call in the function that likely touches the newly allocated memory. If it is a macro or function that uses memset/memcpy/etc., its implementation and the length it writes are essential to verify it does not write past pool->size or otherwise violate bounds.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: Used to compute alloc_size for the malloc fallback path. The definition is needed to verify that alloc_size >= max, that it does not under/overshoot due to rounding logic, and thus that subsequent writes (e.g., by _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) are within the allocated buffer.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the alignment assertion and typically tied to ROUND_TO_ALIGN. Its value is required to reason about alignment rounding and the modulus check on pool->memory; this can affect the computed sizes and whether pointer arithmetic or memory writes could overrun an object.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Used in the mmap/VirtualAlloc code path to round up max to page granularity. Its value and type are necessary to check the arithmetic that computes alloc_size (including potential overflow) so you can ensure the allocated region is at least as large as the poison/write length.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro/implementation may have side effects or be compiled out; knowing its behavior is necessary so the analyzer can determine whether alignment/size checks are enforced at runtime or are only debug-time checks.\n\nCollectively, these symbols allow computing the exact allocated byte count (alloc_size/pool->size), understanding how the memory is poisoned/written, and verifying that any use of string.h functions (directly in this function or inside _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) does not write/read beyond the allocated object bounds."
