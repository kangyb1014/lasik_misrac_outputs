  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that memcmp shall not be used to compare null-terminated strings you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- memcmp: the exact standard library function named in the MISRA rule; required to detect any direct uses in compress_buf.\n- __builtin_memcmp: compiler built-in or alias for memcmp; included to catch non-identifier uses that are equivalent to memcmp.\n- memcpy: used in compress_buf; included so the analyzer can distinguish copying operations from comparisons and avoid false positives.\n- realloc: used in compress_buf; included to understand memory-resize behavior that might affect string storage analysis.\n- free: used in compress_buf; included to understand memory lifetime and ensure no hidden compare-after-free/aliasing issues.\n- deflate: called inside compress_buf; included so the analyzer can confirm deflate is not (directly or via a macro) using memcmp on null-terminated strings that would make compress_buf indirectly violate the rule.\n- read_cb: the only caller in the static call graph; included because whether a buffer passed as src is a null-terminated string may depend on the caller\u2019s behavior/contract \u2014 the analyzer must inspect read_cb to decide if any comparisons in compress_buf would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n- z_stream: type of strm; needed to understand members (next_in, avail_in, next_out, avail_out) and whether any pointer fields refer to C strings (null-terminated) or binary buffers.\n- Bytef,uInt: zlib typedefs used in the function signatures; included so the analyzer can resolve types and decide whether the code is operating on byte buffers or character strings.\n- CHUNK: buffer size macro used for I/O loops; included because it helps determine whether the code treats data as bounded binary blocks (less likely to be C strings) or as string data.\n- Z_NO_FLUSH,Z_SYNC_FLUSH,Z_OK: zlib constant macros used with deflate; include to resolve control flow/return conditions and to confirm behavior is streaming/binary compression rather than string processing.\n- MHD_Result,MHD_YES,MHD_NO: return type and result constants used by compress_buf; included so the analyzer can resolve return values and control-flow implications.\n\nUsing these symbols the next analyst can (1) search for any direct or indirect use of memcmp (or aliases) inside compress_buf, (2) confirm whether any comparisons would be operating on null-terminated strings (by inspecting read_cb and the types/semantics of src/z_stream fields), and (3) rule out false positives where other standard functions (memcpy/realloc/free) are used but do not violate the MISRA memcmp rule."
