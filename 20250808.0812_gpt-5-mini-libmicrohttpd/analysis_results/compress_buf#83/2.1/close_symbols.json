  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide whether any code in compress_buf is unreachable:\n\n- CHUNK (macro/constant): The control flow of both loops and calculations (strm->avail_in assignment, strm->avail_out = CHUNK, have = CHUNK - strm->avail_out, and the src_size decrement src_size -= CHUNK) depends on CHUNK's value. If CHUNK is zero or has unusual value the loops/conditions could become statically (or effectively) non-terminating or make branches dead; its numeric value is necessary to determine compile-time reachable paths.\n\n- z_stream (type definition: fields avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out and their types): The code predicates (0 == strm->avail_out) and assignments to fields are based on these members. Knowing their types (signed/unsigned width) and semantics is required to reason about whether the loop conditions can be known false/true at compile time and whether assignments/updates can produce unreachable branches.\n\n- deflate (prototype and semantic contract): compress_buf calls deflate and relies on its side effects (in particular modification of strm->avail_out and strm->avail_in) and its return values. To determine whether inner and outer loops can terminate or whether certain branches are impossible, the analysis must know deflate's guaranteed behaviour (when/if it reduces avail_out, how it updates avail_in, and possible return codes).\n\n- Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK (zlib macros): These constants appear in the control flow (flush comparisons, and comparison against deflate return). Their defined values and semantics are needed to evaluate the loop termination condition (flush != Z_SYNC_FLUSH) and the ret assignment, which affect whether code after those points is reachable.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and enumerators MHD_YES, MHD_NO: The function returns an enum MHD_Result value computed from deflate's result and from error paths (realloc failure). Knowing the enum and its values helps check whether any return statements or value-dependent branches are unreachable or redundant.\n\n- size_t semantics / definition of src_size and *offset (platform width and wrap behaviour): The outer loop and the arithmetic src_size -= CHUNK and *offset += strm->avail_in rely on size_t behaviour. If size_t arithmetic were to wrap in a platform-specific way or if src_size's initial value has constraints, that can affect whether the branch setting flush to Z_SYNC_FLUSH is ever reached. Knowing the width/semantics of size_t is necessary for sound reachability reasoning.\n\nNote: Standard library functions (realloc, free, memcpy) are not required to decide static unreachable code in this function beyond acknowledging that realloc(NULL) may cause an early return; their runtime failure modes do not create compile-time unreachable code and thus are not listed as required symbols."
