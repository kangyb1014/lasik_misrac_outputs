  "explanation": "z_stream: full struct definition (members avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out and their types). Required to determine that expressions like strm->avail_in and strm->next_in modify the object pointed to by the pointer parameter strm (allowed) rather than reassigning the parameter itself (disallowed).\n\nCHUNK: macro value/name. Needed to understand the arithmetic and loop that updates src_size (src_size -= CHUNK) and to reason about whether src_size (a value parameter) is being modified (which would violate the rule).\n\nuInt and Bytef: typedefs used for struct members and casts. Knowing these types clarifies that assignments to strm->next_in and to/from src operate on the pointee object types, not on the src pointer variable itself.\n\ndeflate and Z_OK / Z_NO_FLUSH / Z_SYNC_FLUSH: prototype and return-code macros. Required to see that deflate is called with the z_stream pointer (modifies the pointee object) and to understand control flow/return handling \u2014 but not to confuse modification of the pointer parameter itself with modifications to the pointed-to object.\n\nrealloc, free, memcpy: prototypes. Needed to confirm how *dest is manipulated: realloc returns a new pointer which is assigned into *dest (modifying the pointee of dest, allowed) and free/memcpy operate on the pointee. This disambiguates modifications of the pointer variable dest vs. modifications of the object it points to.\n\nenum MHD_Result / MHD_YES / MHD_NO: definition of the return enum and constants. Included so the analyzer can see that ret is a local and the function returns a local/enum constant rather than modifying parameter variables.\n\nuint8_t: typedef used in the memcpy target expression; included for completeness to understand the pointer arithmetic on *dest.\n\n(These symbols together let an analyzer determine which assignments modify parameter variables (e.g., src_size -= CHUNK \u2014 a modification of a by-value parameter) versus which modify objects pointed to by pointer parameters (allowed by the rule): modifications through *offset, *dest, *dest_size, and fields of *strm.)"
