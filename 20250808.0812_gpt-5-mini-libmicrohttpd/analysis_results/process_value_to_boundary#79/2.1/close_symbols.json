  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in process_value_to_boundary is unreachable you must know the types, values and invariants that control the loops, branches and the single exit points. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: The function reads and writes many pp fields (buffer_pos, buffer_size, skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, ikvi, value_offset, plus content-related fields). Reachability of later statements depends on initial values and invariants of these fields (e.g. buffer_pos vs buffer_size, must_ikvi). You need the struct definition and any documented invariants to decide if certain branches/loops can ever be taken.\n\n- enum PP_State (including PP_Error): The function assigns pp->state and compares/uses PP_Error; to decide if assignments/returns lead to dead code (or impossible state transitions) you must know the legal state space and semantics.\n\n- RN_Dash: The function sets pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash; its meaning may affect state-machine transitions and whether subsequent code paths are reachable.\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO: These return/result codes guard control flow (IKVI return comparison, function return values). You need their definitions to interpret conditions that cause early returns (which can make later code unreachable).\n\n- pp->ikvi callback prototype and semantics: The call to pp->ikvi can cause an early return from the function if it returns MHD_NO. To determine if the success/failure branch is ever taken (making later code unreachable), you need the callback signature, documented possible return values, and whether the pointer can be NULL (NULL would be undefined behaviour rather than reachable code). Also you need to know whether ikvi has side effects that change pp state.\n\n- post_process_multipart (caller): Reachability of parts of process_value_to_boundary depends on how the caller initializes pp, passes boundary and blen, and supplies next_state/next_dash_state. Inspecting the caller (and how/when it calls this function) is necessary to see whether some branches can ever occur.\n\n- find_boundary (or other caller helpers producing boundary/blen): The values of boundary and blen are used to decide boundary detection and loop exit; knowing how they are computed (e.g. constraints on blen) can show some checks/branches are impossible.\n\n- memchr and memcmp semantics: While standard, including them explicitly ensures the analyzer treats their behavior (return values, matching semantics) correctly when reasoning about loop progression and branch conditions that affect reachability.\n\nHaving these symbols and their semantics allows a subsequent analyzer to determine whether any branch/statement in process_value_to_boundary can never be executed (i.e., is unreachable) under any valid program state and caller usage, as required by the MISRA rule check."
