  "explanation": "Why each is required for assessing the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\":\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The function repeatedly writes to pp->... members (skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, value_offset, etc.) and computes buf = (char *)&pp[1]. To determine whether those operations modify the function parameter variable pp itself (which would violate the rule) or only the object pointed to by pp (which is allowed), the analyzer needs the exact struct layout and member types. The trailing buffer layout (&pp[1]) must also be known to confirm that buf is derived from the object memory, not by reassigning the pp parameter.\n\n- typedef/enum PP_State: next_state and next_dash_state are parameters of this enum type and are used in the assignment pp->state = next_state / pp->dash_state = next_dash_state. Knowing PP_State confirms these are value parameters (enum type) and that the code copies their values into struct members (allowed) rather than modifying the parameter objects.\n\n- RN_Dash: used to set pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash. Knowing RN_Dash only affects understanding that a struct member is assigned a constant; it helps confirm the code writes to the pointee, not to the parameter variable.\n\n- PP_Error: assigned to pp->state in error paths and compared when returning. Knowing this symbol ensures the analyzer can distinguish assigning a symbolic constant to a member versus modifying a parameter variable.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: return values used by the function and by the ikvi call. They are required to understand return-value code paths (e.g., early return on error) and to confirm no parameter variable assignments are hidden in macros.\n\n- Prototype/type of pp->ikvi function-pointer: The call pp->ikvi(...) passes several struct members and buf/value_offset/newline. The analyzer must know the ikvi signature to be sure that call does not mutate any of this function's parameter variables (for example, via aliasing) and to ensure that only pointee objects are passed and possibly modified (which is allowed), not the parameter variables themselves.\n\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: symbolic argument passed to ikvi; included so the ikvi call is completely understood when reasoning about whether any function-parameter variable of process_value_to_boundary is modified indirectly.\n\nNotes: memchr/memcmp and standard types (size_t, const char *) are standard and not required as additional project symbols for the MISRA parameter-modification check. The critical information is the struct layout, the enum/type definitions, the constants assigned to struct members, and the ikvi prototype to rule out indirect modification of this function's parameter variables."
