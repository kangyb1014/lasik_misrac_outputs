  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified MHD_get_response_element_n_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/683.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_get_response_element_n_ as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_element_n_:\n```c\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *\nMHD_get_response_element_n_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key,\n                             size_t key_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != key);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key[0]);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_len) &&\n        (kind == pos->kind) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_get_response_element_n_ code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function takes 'response' as a non-const pointer but does not modify the MHD_Response itself; it returns a pointer to a MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (non-const) found in the response. Because the caller is expected to be able to modify the returned header, the parameter cannot be made const without changing the API (or changing the return type to a const header pointer). The 'key' parameter is already const-qualified. Therefore there is no actionable opportunity to add const-qualification here that preserves the original behavior; Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
