  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified MHD_get_response_element_n_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/687.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_get_response_element_n_ as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_element_n_:\n```c\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *\nMHD_get_response_element_n_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key,\n                             size_t key_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != key);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key[0]);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_len) &&\n        (kind == pos->kind) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_get_response_element_n_ code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: The function asserts key != NULL, key[0] != 0 and key_len != 0 and only calls MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ when pos->header_size == key_len. By ensuring the comparison length is the same for both pointers the code does not cause accesses beyond the supplied lengths. Assuming pos->header and key are valid objects of at least header_size bytes (the caller/allocator responsibility), this use will not read past the buffers and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.",
