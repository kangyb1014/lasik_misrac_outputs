The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of serve_simple_form as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of serve_simple_form:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nserve_simple_form (const void *cls,\n                   const char *mime,\n                   struct Session *session,\n                   struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  const char *form = cls;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  /* return static form */\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (form), form);\n  add_session_cookie (session, response);\n  if (MHD_YES !=\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                               mime))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set content type header!\\n\");\n    /* return response without content type anyway ... */\n  }\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                            MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                            response);\n  MHD_destroy_response (response);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above serve_simple_form code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No unreachable code: all statements in serve_simple_form are reachable. The if-statement body (error log) can execute when MHD_add_response_header returns a value other than MHD_YES; the main return path via ret is always reachable. There are no early returns, dead branches, or statements placed after a guaranteed-return or infinite-loop, so Rule 2.1 is not violated.",
