  "explanation": "To check the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must know whether any comparisons in post_iterator ultimately invoke memcmp (directly or via a macro/wrapper) and whether the compared objects are null-terminated strings: \n- strcmp: The function in the code uses strcmp. You must verify strcmp is the real standard function and not a macro or wrapper that delegates to memcmp. If strcmp is redefined to call memcmp, that would violate the rule.\n- memcmp: The forbidden function itself must be checked across the compilation unit / linked symbols to see if it is called directly from this code or indirectly via macros/wrappers. Include its declaration to detect accidental use.\n- memcpy: post_iterator uses memcpy to copy data into session->value_1/value_2; knowing memcpy's role helps determine whether the buffers are treated as NUL-terminated strings (they are explicitly NUL-terminated after copy). Also check that memcpy isn't a macro that hides memcmp usage (unlikely but include for completeness).\n- struct Session: You need the full definition (types and sizes of sid, value_1, value_2) to confirm that value_1/value_2 are char arrays intended as null-terminated strings (versus pointers or non-char storage). That determines whether comparing keys/values uses null-terminated string semantics.\n- struct Request: Contains the session pointer; include to resolve how session is obtained and to ensure no additional indirection changes types/semantics.\n- any preprocessor macros that redefine strcmp/memcmp: A macro could map strcmp to memcmp or to a wrapper that uses memcmp. These must be known to conclude whether a memcmp-based comparison of NUL-terminated strings occurs.\n- string.h declarations / prototypes for strcmp, memcmp, memcpy: Including the standard prototypes (or the effective declarations in the translation unit) helps detect mismatches or replacement functions/macros and is useful to determine whether the used functions are the standard ones or replaced by platform-specific implementations that may internally use memcmp.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions to the next agent so it can determine whether any call in post_iterator ends up using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
