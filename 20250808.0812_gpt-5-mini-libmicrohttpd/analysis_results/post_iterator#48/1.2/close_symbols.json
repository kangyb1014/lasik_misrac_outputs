  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n- enum MHD_Result: needed to inspect the enum definition for any compiler-specific extensions (attributes, nonstandard underlying type, macros expanding to compiler intrinsics). \n- enum MHD_ValueKind: same reason as above (definition might use extensions). \n- MHD_YES: this token is used as a return value; it may be an enum constant or a macro \u2014 its definition must be checked for extension usage (macros expanding to compiler builtins or attributes). \n- struct Request: the function casts cls to struct Request; the struct definition must be checked to ensure it does not use compiler extensions (bitfields with nonstandard widths, attributes, anonymous structs/unions as extensions, etc.). \n- struct Session: required because its definition (and any annotations) could use language extensions and its layout/field types affect buffer size and bounds checking. \n- struct Session::sid: the sid member is accessed in a fprintf format; its type/definition must be known to ensure no extension (e.g., nonstandard string type) is used. \n- struct Session::value_1 and struct Session::value_2: these array fields are written into and sized with sizeof; their declarations (array sizes and any attributes, flexible-array usage, or compiler extensions) must be inspected to determine if extensions are used and if bounds operations are correct. \n- memcpy: the declaration/definition may be a macro or map to a compiler builtin/extension; verify it is a standard library function and not a compiler-specific intrinsic with extension semantics. \n- strcmp: same as memcpy (could be macro or builtin). \n- fprintf, stdout, stderr: these I/O symbols may be macros or defined with attributes; check their declarations to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used. \n- uint64_t: the integer typedef could come from an implementation header that uses typedef extensions; confirm it is the standard fixed-width type, not an extension. \n- size_t: same rationale as uint64_t \u2014 its definition may hide implementation-specific extensions. \n\nProviding these symbol definitions allows analysis of whether any of them (types, macros, function declarations or struct members) rely on compiler-specific language extensions; without them you cannot determine compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
