This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required for a MISRA C <string.h> bounds analysis:\n\n- struct Session: Must inspect the exact declaration/layout of Session to know whether value_1/value_2 are arrays or pointers and where fields lie in memory. The safety of memcpy writes and the correctness of sizeof(session->value_1) depend on this definition.\n\n- struct Request: To verify the type of request->session and ensure session is the expected object (pointer vs embedded), and to check any invariants about its lifetime/validity that could affect buffer accesses.\n\n- session->value_1: The element type and, critically, the declared array size (or whether it is a pointer) are required to determine whether writes at offset 'off' for 'size' bytes can exceed the destination bounds.\n\n- session->value_2: Same reason as value_1; the function performs symmetric writes to value_2 and must be checked separately.\n\n- session->sid: Although not used with memcpy, its type/size matters if value_1/value_2 are small and adjacent fields could be overwritten; knowing sid helps determine potential overflow targets.\n\n- size_t: The width and range of size_t (platform typedef) are needed to reason about the arithmetic size + off, comparisons against sizeof(...), and whether implicit type conversions/overflow could occur in the expressions that guard memcpy.\n\n- uint64_t: The exact width and range of uint64_t (the type of off) are needed for the same reason as size_t \u2014 to reason about usual arithmetic conversions between size and off and potential wrap/overflow issues in the bounds checks.\n\n- memcpy (prototype from <string.h>): The standard prototype and semantics are needed to confirm that memcpy writes exactly the requested number of bytes to the destination and does not perform bounds checks; MISRA rule analysis requires treating memcpy as a raw copy and ensuring the destination object has enough storage for the requested length.\n\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): Although strcmp is not a memory-writing function, its prototype and behavior are relevant to ensure key comparisons are valid (e.g., key is NUL-terminated) and to exclude interaction with buffer writes; include it to complete the reasoning about use of string.h functions.\n\nProviding the above declarations (especially the full struct Session definition including array sizes) allows a precise determination whether the memcpy calls can ever write beyond the bounds of the destination objects and whether the size/off arithmetic and guards are sufficient to prevent out-of-bounds accesses, per the MISRA rule."
