  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified answer_to_connection code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/435.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of answer_to_connection as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of answer_to_connection:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nanswer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                      const char *url, const char *method,\n                      const char *version, const char *upload_data,\n                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function already const-qualifies all pointer parameters that can be const (url, method, version, upload_data). Pointers that are non-const are intentionally so: size_t *upload_data_size and void **req_cls are modified by this function (they cannot point to const-qualified types), and the callback signature (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection) is imposed by the external library and cannot be changed here. Therefore Rule 8.13 is respected.",
