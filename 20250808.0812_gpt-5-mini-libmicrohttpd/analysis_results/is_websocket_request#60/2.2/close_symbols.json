Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- ahc_cb: The caller(s) determine whether is_websocket_request is actually invoked and how its return value is used. To decide if code in is_websocket_request is executed in normal builds (so removal would affect behaviour) we must inspect ahc_cb call sites and control flow.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value: In the caller(s) this function is the likely source of the upg_header and con_header pointers passed into is_websocket_request. Its behavior (when it returns NULL vs non-NULL and what strings it returns) is needed to know whether the conditional inside is_websocket_request can ever evaluate differently \u2014 i.e. whether any branches are live.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: The caller graph shows this variant is used to obtain header values in ahc_cb; its semantics may affect whether the headers passed to is_websocket_request can be non-NULL/contain \"Upgrade\" or WS_UPGRADE_VALUE, so it is needed to judge if parts of the function are redundant.\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The string (macro/constant) compared against upg_header by strcmp. If this value is NULL, empty, or a fixed value making the strcmp always true/false, removal of portions of the function might not change behaviour. Its definition is therefore required.\n- strcmp: The exact semantics of the equality test are required to judge whether the strcmp call (and thus that comparison) can affect program behaviour. Although standard, you must assume no hidden side-effects; including it documents the dependency.\n- strstr: The strstr call is used to search for \"Upgrade\" inside con_header. Whether it can succeed/fail for the headers produced by the caller influences whether that test is live code.\n- enum MHD_Result: The return type must be known to determine observable behaviour of removing the function or parts of it (e.g. if callers treat return values specially).\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: The concrete values returned by the function determine observable effects in callers; if both map to the same value or are unused by callers removing the function might be behaviour-preserving. Knowing these symbols is necessary to decide whether the return-value-producing code is dead.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (a) whether is_websocket_request is ever executed, (b) whether its internal tests can influence program behaviour given what the caller passes in, and (c) whether removing the executed operations (including the (void) con; suppression) would or would not change observable behaviour \u2014 which is required to assess the MISRA dead-code rule."
