  "explanation": "- ahc_cb: The caller code shows what actual objects/variables are passed into is_websocket_request (which identifiers, whether they are lvalues, derived from non-const APIs, etc.). You must inspect the call site to know whether making the parameter(s) const would break caller assumptions or whether the same object is later modified by the caller.\n- struct MHD_Connection: The parameter con is a pointer to this type. To decide whether the parameter could/should be changed to const struct MHD_Connection * (or whether it must remain non-const because the pointed object is modified elsewhere), you need the type declaration (opaque vs. concrete) and how that type is intended to be used.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: These functions are used (in ahc_cb) to obtain header strings. Their prototypes/return types tell you whether the returned pointers are const-qualified (const char *) or plain char *, which affects whether the upstream code treats header pointers as modifiable and therefore whether passing them to a const parameter is appropriate.\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The comparison uses this symbol in strcmp. Knowing whether it is a string literal, a const char * or a non-const char array/macro clarifies constness expectations and potential MISRA concerns about pointer-to-const.\n- strcmp and strstr prototypes: Their standard declarations use const char * parameters. Having these prototypes confirmed makes clear that is_websocket_request does not need modifiable pointers for these operations and supports qualifying header parameters as const.\n- enum MHD_Result / MHD_YES / MHD_NO: The return type and enumerators are part of the function signature; include them to ensure no implicit conversions or qualifiers are required that could interact with pointer constness analysis.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine whether any pointer parameter in is_websocket_request could or must be const-qualified (or must be non-const because other functions modify the pointee), and thereby assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
