  "explanation": "- fprintf: needed to know the parameter types (especially the format parameter and the stream parameter). The const-qualification of the format argument (const char *) and the non-const FILE * stream parameter determine whether any pointer usage in print_perf_warnings violates the MISRA rule.\n- printf: same reason as fprintf for the format parameter (const char *). Confirms that passing string literals is to a const-qualified parameter.\n- stderr: declaration/typical type (extern FILE *stderr) is required to check whether the FILE pointer passed to fprintf is correctly non-const (fprintf modifies stream state) so it should not be const-qualified.\n- FILE: the definition/type of FILE is needed to reason whether the object pointed to by stderr is modified by fprintf (i.e., whether the pointer must be non-const).\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (prototype): the function is called by print_perf_warnings \u2014 its prototype/signature is required to determine if any pointer parameters or returned pointer types are involved that would trigger the MISRA const-pointer requirement.\n- MHD_NO: the symbolic constant used in the comparison with the result of MHD_is_feature_supported; needed to understand the conditional flow and whether the MHD-related branch (and any pointers in it) is active.\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: the feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; included to verify the prototype/enum type used and ensure no pointer semantics affect the MISRA check.\n- MHD_VERSION: used in the conditional compilation guard around the MHD_is_feature_supported call; needed to know whether that code path is present in the compiled translation unit (affects whether MHD symbols must be considered).\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine (1) whether the function passes any non-const pointers to functions that do not modify the pointees (format strings), (2) whether it passes pointers that are intended to be modified (stderr/FILE), and (3) whether any MHD call introduces pointer usage that would require const-qualification."
