  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified print_perf_warnings code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/317.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of print_perf_warnings as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of print_perf_warnings:\n```c\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above print_perf_warnings code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: print_perf_warnings has no function parameters, so there are no parameters to modify. A representative violation scenario would be if the function accepted a pointer or scalar parameter and assigned to the parameter itself (e.g., void f(int *p) { p = NULL; } or void g(int x) { x = 0; }), which would violate Rule 17.8 (reassigning the parameter variable). Note that modifying the pointee (e.g., *p = 1) is allowed, but reassigning p is not.",
