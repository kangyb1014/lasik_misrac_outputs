Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if print_perf_warnings contains dead code (MISRA: removal of executed operations must change behaviour):\n\n- fprintf\n  - The function emits warnings via fprintf(stderr,...). To decide whether those calls are dead you must know that fprintf has observable side-effects (writes to stderr) in this build and is not a no-op or removed by linking/IO stubbing. Removing fprintf calls would change program output/timing if they actually execute.\n\n- printf\n  - The function calls printf(\"\\n\"). printf produces observable output on stdout and may affect timing. Determine whether removing that call would change behaviour.\n\n- stderr\n  - The fprintf target (stderr) is the observable stream. Its identity (redirected, closed, replaced by a macro, or a no-op in this build) affects whether fprintf is actually observable; must know its definition/state.\n\n- MHD_VERSION\n  - Controls whether the MHD-specific warning block is compiled (#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701). The value determines if that code exists at all; if it's not compiled the code cannot be dead or alive in the binary.\n\n- MHD_NO\n  - Used in comparison with the return of MHD_is_feature_supported. You must know the constant\u2019s value and semantics to decide whether the if-condition can be true and thus whether the enclosed code can execute.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD\n  - The feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; you need to know what query is performed to understand when the condition can be true and the fprintf inside executed.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (implementation/specification)\n  - The call may have side-effects (or not) and returns a value that controls execution of a warning and affects newline_needed. To decide if the call or the conditional block is dead you must inspect the function\u2019s semantics, return domain, and whether it can be inlined/optimized away or has observable side-effects beyond its return value.\n\n- _DEBUG (compile-time macro)\n  - Determines whether the debug-assert warning block is compiled. Its defined/undefined state is a build-time decision that changes whether the code exists; needed to decide if code is present/executed.\n\n- __GNUC__ (compile-time macro)\n  - Combined with __OPTIMIZE__ / __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__ to control compilation of optimization-related warnings; required to know which warning blocks are present in the binary.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE__ (compile-time macro)\n  - When undefined (i.e. no -O) the second warning block is compiled. Its state affects presence/execution of code.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__ (compile-time macro)\n  - When defined the size-optimization warning block is compiled. Its state affects presence/execution of code.\n\nNotes: compile-time macros and MHD_VERSION determine whether code is present in the compiled binary (not unreachable). Runtime behaviour (fprintf/printf/MHD_is_feature_supported) determines whether executed operations have observable effects. To rule code as dead under MISRA you must show that an executed operation can be removed without changing observable behaviour \u2014 that requires the above symbols (compile-time and runtime) and the implementation/specification of MHD_is_feature_supported and the I/O functions/streams."
