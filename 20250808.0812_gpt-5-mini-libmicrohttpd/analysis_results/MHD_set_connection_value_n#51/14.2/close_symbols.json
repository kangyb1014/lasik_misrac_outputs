The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "MHD_set_connection_value_n calls MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_. To decide MISRA Rule conformance for for-loops you must inspect the bodies of any functions invoked by the target (the behaviour of a for-loop body includes called functions). Therefore the direct callee MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ must be provided so its source can be checked for any for statements and whether those loops are well-formed. MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ itself calls MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (per the static call graph); that function must also be available because it may contain for-loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags in loops found in caller functions. Finally, the target uses strlen in expressions; the actual implementation/definition of strlen (or its replacement/inlined implementation in this project) should be available because library implementations can contain loops whose behaviour might be relevant if they are inlined or part of the compiled source under analysis. These symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether any for-loops reachable from the target function violate the quoted MISRA rule."
