  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified MHD_set_connection_value_n code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/410.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_set_connection_value_n as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_connection_value_n:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_connection_value_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                            const char *key,\n                            size_t key_size,\n                            const char *value,\n                            size_t value_size)\n{\n  if ( (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != kind) &&\n       ( ((key ? strlen (key) : 0) != key_size) ||\n         ((value ? strlen (value) : 0) != value_size) ) )\n    return MHD_NO; /* binary zero is allowed only in GET arguments */\n\n  return MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (connection,\n                                              kind,\n                                              key,\n                                              key_size,\n                                              value,\n                                              value_size);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_set_connection_value_n code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",

The function performs a runtime check of argument sizes and conditionally returns MHD_NO; each expression (the kind comparison and the ternary strlen evaluations) affects that decision.
