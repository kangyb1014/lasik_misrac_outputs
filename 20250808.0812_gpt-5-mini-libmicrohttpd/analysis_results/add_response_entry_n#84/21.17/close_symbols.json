  "explanation": "memchr: The function under inspection calls memchr; you need the standard declaration/semantics (signature and guarantee that it only reads up to the supplied size_t length) to reason about whether the call can access beyond the object bounds.\n\nMHD_add_response_entry_no_check_: This callee is invoked with the same header/content pointers and lengths. To determine whether any string.h call (or other memory access) will go out of bounds as a result of these parameters, you must inspect its implementation/signature and how it uses header/header_len and content/content_len.\n\nadd_response_entry: This immediate caller(s) constructs/passes the header, content, and their lengths into add_response_entry_n. To prove memchr is safe you must examine how those buffers and lengths are produced/validated in the caller.\n\nMHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer: These higher-level callers are listed in the static call graph and may be sources of header/content or compute lengths before propagation down to add_response_entry_n. They must be checked to ensure the pointer/length pairs given to add_response_entry_n are consistent and within object bounds.\n\nstruct MHD_Response (definition): The response object is passed through to MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_. If that function uses fields of the response to compute buffer lengths or perform further string.h operations, you need the struct layout/semantics to reason about potential out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nenum MHD_ValueKind (definition): Although not directly related to memchr, the kind argument may alter the behavior/path in MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ (or other callers). You need its definition to understand control flow that could lead to different uses of header/content and thus different string.h invocations."
