  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must examine the declarations/definitions that could themselves be extensions or could hide extensions via macros/attributes. For each symbol:\n\n- bool\n  - Why needed: 'bool' may be the C99/standard macro/type from <stdbool.h>, a project typedef, or a macro that expands to an implementation-specific or non-standard construct. Inspecting its declaration reveals whether a language extension (non-standard type or macro) is used.\n\n- size_t\n  - Why needed: size_t is normally from <stddef.h>/<stdio.h>. A nonstandard typedef or macro could be in effect; checking the actual typedef ensures there's no use of compiler-specific sized types or extensions.\n\n- NULL\n  - Why needed: NULL is a macro and could be defined in a nonstandard way (for example as something using compiler extensions). Confirming the definition rules out macro tricks that rely on extensions.\n\n- memchr\n  - Why needed: memchr is a standard library function, but it can be redefined as a macro or inline/ builtin with compiler-specific attributes (e.g., builtins, inline assembly, __attribute__). You must see its prototype/definition to ensure no extension is used at the call site.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_\n  - Why needed: this external callee may be a macro or function with compiler-specific attributes, inline assembly, statement-expressions, typeof, or other extensions. The actual declaration/definition is needed to determine whether the call or the callee uses language extensions that affect the target function.\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - Why needed: the struct type could be defined using nonstandard extensions (e.g., attributes, packed/aligned pragmas, anonymous or compiler-specific bitfield extensions). Inspecting the struct definition rules out such uses.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind\n  - Why needed: the enum definition might use compiler extensions (e.g., explicit underlying type via extension) or macros around enum constants. Its definition must be checked for extensions.\n\n- add_response_entry\n  - Why needed: it is the immediate caller in the static call graph and may be a macro wrapper or inline function that uses extensions; also its prototype/definition can reveal macros/attributes that influence use of add_response_entry_n.\n\n- relevant included headers / preprocessor macro definitions (e.g. stdbool.h, stddef.h, string.h, project headers that define MHD_*)\n  - Why needed: many language extensions are introduced via headers or preprocessor macros (redefining tokens, introducing __extension__ pragmas, providing compiler builtins). To be certain the translation unit does not rely on extensions you need the actual headers and the set of macro definitions in effect when compiling this translation unit (including any project headers that define MHD_* identifiers).\n\nProvide these definitions/declarations (or the preprocessed translation unit/macros) to the next analyst so they can detect any use of compiler-specific keywords, builtins, attributes, inline assembly, statement-expressions, typeof, or other language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
