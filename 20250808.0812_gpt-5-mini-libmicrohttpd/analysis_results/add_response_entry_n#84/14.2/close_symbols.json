The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether add_response_entry_n violates the MISRA C for-loop rule you must inspect any for-loops in the function and in any code that contributes to the behaviour of those loops. The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ (declaration + definition/body): This is the sole non-library function called by add_response_entry_n. If that function contains any for-loops, their formation (loop counter, loop condition, and loop increment) must be checked because the MISRA rule requires considering the behaviour of functions called within loop bodies. You need the full definition to find and analyse any for-statements it contains and whether they use or modify objects that would violate the three-clause constraints.\n\n- memchr (declaration + implementation): add_response_entry_n calls memchr multiple times. Although memchr is a standard library routine (declared in <string.h>) and typically has no side effects, its implementation could contain loops. If those implementations were ever used inside a for-loop context reachable from this function, they would need inspection. At minimum you need the declaration to confirm it is a pure library call and the implementation only for deep inspection of loop structure.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (complete type definition): The response object is passed into the callee MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_. The callee may iterate over or modify fields of this structure using for-loops; to assess whether such loops are well-formed you need the structure definition to see which objects could be used as loop counters or be modified inside loops.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (complete definition): The enum value is passed to the callee; the callee implementation may branch or loop based on this enum. Knowing its definition helps identify loop-control flags or counters derived from it inside called functions.\n\nNotes: add_response_entry_n itself contains no for statements, so it cannot directly violate the rule. The only potential for concern arises from analysing the bodies of functions it calls (primarily MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_) to ensure any for-loops there are well-formed and do not rely on or modify objects in ways forbidden by MISRA. If you confirm the callee(s) contain no for-loops (or only well-formed ones), no MISRA violation exists for this function."
