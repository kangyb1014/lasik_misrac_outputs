A pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct UploadContext\n   - Required to know the exact types and const-qualification of the fields accessed in the function (at least: category, language, filename, response). The MISRA rule under review concerns whether pointers should be const-qualified where possible; whether uc->category and uc->language are declared as char * or const char * (and whether uc->filename/uc->response are const-qualified) is decisive.\n\n2) do_append\n   - The function is called with &uc->category and &uc->language. To decide if those fields must be (or must not be) const-qualified we must see do_append's prototype/definition: what pointer types it accepts and whether it modifies the pointed-to objects (does it take char **, char * const *, const char *, etc.). If do_append modifies the strings or the pointers, that affects whether the fields can/should be const.\n\n3) request_refused_response\n   - process_upload_data assigns this symbol into uc->response. To check const-correctness of uc->response we need the type/const-qualification of request_refused_response (and whether assigning it to the response field drops or adds const). This affects whether uc->response should be declared to point to const or non-const data.\n\n4) internal_error_response\n   - Same reason as request_refused_response: it's assigned to uc->response on error paths, so its type/const-qualification is required to determine the correct constness of uc->response.\n\n5) strdup\n   - uc->filename is set to strdup(fn). The return type of strdup is non-const char *. Knowing this confirms whether assigning to uc->filename is compatible with its declared const-qualification (i.e., whether uc->filename must be a non-const pointer). This helps determine if uc->filename (and by extension the UploadContext definition) violates the MISRA pointer const rule.\n\n(Notes: standard library prototypes such as strcmp/strstr/strchr/write/open/free/unlink are normally known and carry appropriate const qualifiers for their parameters; they are not strictly required here unless local project headers override their signatures. The five symbols above are the minimal additional declarations needed to decide const-qualification issues introduced by the target function.)"
