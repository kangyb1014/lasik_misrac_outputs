This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether any use of functions from <string.h> can access beyond object bounds you must know whether the pointer arguments passed to those functions always point to valid, NUL-terminated objects and how those objects are constructed/modified:\n\n- struct UploadContext: The code uses uc->category, uc->language and uc->filename with string functions and indexing. You must know their types (char *?), initial values (NULL or allocated), and invariants (always NUL-terminated when non-NULL). If these members are not NUL-terminated or point to buffers smaller than expected, strcmp/strstr/strchr could read out of bounds.\n\n- do_append: process_upload_data calls do_append(&uc->category, data, size) and (&uc->language, ...). The implementation of do_append determines how category/language buffers are allocated/grown and whether they are kept NUL-terminated. do_append may itself call memcpy/strcat/strcpy/etc. Its code and contract are therefore essential to decide if string.h rules are respected.\n\n- PATH_MAX: The local fn buffer is declared using PATH_MAX; the exact size matters to verify that snprintf usage and the subsequent loop (for i = 0; i < (size_t) res; i++) cannot index beyond fn. You need the actual numeric limit to reason about possible overflows.\n\n- Contract/specification for the upload callback parameters: The code calls strcmp(key, \"category\"), strcmp(key, \"language\") and uses strchr/strstr on filename. These functions require their first argument to be a valid NUL-terminated C string. You must know the library (MHD) guarantee about whether key and filename are NUL-terminated and when their storage is valid (lifetime) to conclude safety. Also you must know that data is not assumed to be NUL-terminated (and how do_append treats it).\n\n- Prototypes/semantics of strcmp, strstr, strchr: While standard, their requirement that inputs be NUL-terminated and that they perform reads up to the terminating NUL is central to this MISRA rule. Include their documented behavior so you can check whether any call sites might read past buffer bounds.\n\n- snprintf semantics: Although not in <string.h>, the safety of subsequent operations on fn depends on snprintf's return value and null-termination behavior. The code relies on checking snprintf's return value (res) against sizeof(fn). To show that no out-of-bounds access occurs when later iterating up to res and accessing fn[i], you must use the standard snprintf semantics (what res means when truncation occurs and whether a NUL was written when res < sizeof(fn)).\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions lets the next analyst determine whether strcmp/strstr/strchr are ever called with non-NUL-terminated or undersized buffers (a MISRA violation), or whether any string.h usage in do_append or other related routines could read or write beyond object bounds."
