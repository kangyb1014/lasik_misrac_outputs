The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "i \u2014 the loop counter (declared as size_t). MISRA requires identifying the single loop counter, ensuring it is initialized only in the first clause, incremented only in the third clause, and not modified in the loop body.\n\nres \u2014 used in the second clause as (size_t) res. You must confirm res is not modified in the loop body (or by any function called from the body) and that the second clause uses only the loop counter and allowed flags. Also res's origin (snprintf return) can affect the loop bound and must be considered.\n\nfn \u2014 the array whose elements are modified in the loop body (fn[i] = '_'). MISRA forbids using objects in the second/third clauses that are modified in the loop body; thus you must check that fn is not used in the loop clauses and is only modified in the body.\n\nisprint \u2014 the function/macro called inside the loop body. MISRA treats the behaviour of functions called within the for statement as part of the loop body; you must inspect isprint to ensure it does not modify the loop counter or res (or other objects used in clauses) and has no persistent side effects that would violate the rule.\n\nsnprintf \u2014 the call that assigns res before the loop. To reason about the loop bound (res) you need snprintf's semantics (return value, possible truncation/negative return) to determine whether the loop condition is well-formed/meaningful and whether res could be affected by side effects relevant to the rule.\n\nsize_t \u2014 the type of i and the cast in the second clause. MISRA analysis needs the exact integer type/range to confirm the loop counter behaviour (initialization, comparison with (size_t)res, and increment) and to ensure no implicit conversions introduce additional objects/side effects that would violate the rule."
