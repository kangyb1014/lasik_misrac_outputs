  "explanation": "To determine whether this function (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any called APIs/macros and the data types they operate on. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: The function is called and may be implemented in userland or as a wrapper; it could (in theory) call memcmp on returned data or on strings. Inspect its implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- cpuset_t: The type of the mask filled by cpuset_getaffinity. You need its definition to confirm it is a bitmask/structure (not a char* or string) so that subsequent operations cannot be string comparisons.\n- CPU_COUNT: Macro or function used to count CPUs in a cpuset_t. Inspect its expansion/implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp on strings.\n- CPU_COUNT_S: Alternative counting routine used for dynamically allocated masks. Inspect its signature and implementation (and whether its first parameter is a byte size vs. CPU count) to ensure no memcmp-on-string usage.\n- CPU_ISSET: Macro used in the fallback loop to test bits in cur_mask. Verify its expansion operates on bitmaps/integers rather than performing string comparisons (memcmp).\n- CPU_ALLOC / CPU_FREE: Allocation helpers for cpusets. Inspect to ensure they return a suitably typed buffer (not a char* holding strings) and do not wrap any code that compares strings using memcmp.\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: Determines the bytes passed to cpuset_getaffinity and CPU_COUNT_S. Needed to ensure the buffer semantics are non-string and to inspect any conversions that might lead to string comparisons.\n- CPU_SETSIZE / CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: Constants that bound loops and mask sizing. Needed to understand loop ranges and to confirm CPU_ISSET/bit operations act on bitmaps not strings.\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH / CPU_WHICH_PID: Constants passed to cpuset_getaffinity; included so the callee implementation can be located/inspected with the exact parameters (some implementations may switch behavior based on these constants).\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: Compile-time macros that determine which code paths are present. You must know which of the alternate branches/macros are active in the build to inspect the correct implementations/expansions for potential memcmp misuse.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementations/expansions of the above functions/macros and the cpuset_t type under the active compile-time configuration to ensure none of them call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The target function itself contains no memcmp, so the only risk is indirect usage in these symbols."
