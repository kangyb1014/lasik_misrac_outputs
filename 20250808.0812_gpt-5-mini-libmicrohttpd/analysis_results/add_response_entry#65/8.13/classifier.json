  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified add_response_entry code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/523.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of add_response_entry as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_response_entry:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nadd_response_entry (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                    enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                    const char *header,\n                    const char *content)\n{\n  size_t header_len;\n  size_t content_len;\n\n  if (NULL == content)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  header_len = strlen (header);\n  content_len = strlen (content);\n  return add_response_entry_n (response, kind, header,\n                               header_len, content,\n                               content_len) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code. Both parameters header and content are declared as const char * and are only used in read-only operations (strlen) within add_response_entry; they are forwarded unchanged to add_response_entry_n. There is no evidence in the provided snippet that the buffers are modified here, so Rule 8.13 is satisfied. (A potential violation would occur if add_response_entry_n had a prototype taking non-const char * and actually modified the data \u2014 that would require changing the callee to accept const or not modifying the pointed objects.)",
