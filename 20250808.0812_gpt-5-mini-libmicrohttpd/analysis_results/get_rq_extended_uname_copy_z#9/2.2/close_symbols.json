  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z:\n\n- SSIZE_MAX\n  - The function compares uname_ext_len against (size_t) SSIZE_MAX and later asserts SSIZE_MAX > w. Knowing the concrete value (or how it relates to size_t range on the target platform) is necessary to decide whether the initial check and the assert can ever be true/false (i.e. whether those branches are reachable or are statically redundant/dead).\n\n- ssize_t\n  - The return type cast at the end depends on ssize_t range. To determine whether the cast and related bound checks are meaningful or redundant (dead), you must know ssize_t's representation/range.\n\n- size_t\n  - uname_ext_len, buf_size, and intermediate values use size_t. Understanding the type width/behavior is required to reason about range comparisons and whether some conditionals/branches can be true (reachability).\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN\n  - This constant is compared to uname_ext_len early to possibly return -1. Its numeric value relative to other constants (like the prefix length) determines whether that check can ever fire (dead) or is required.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX\n  - The code requires the request string to start with this prefix and then initializes r to the prefix length. The concrete prefix content/length affects loop start position and whether the subsequent loop/search for a single quote can ever find a quote or is vacuous. Knowing the prefix is required to judge reachability of the loop body and later checks.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_\n  - This macro supplies the length passed to the equality check and used to initialize r. Its exact expansion (e.g. sizeof(prefix)-1) is needed to determine r's initial value and therefore whether subsequent bounds tests and the language-tag scan are reachable or redundant.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_\n  - The function call gates a large portion of the function (early return if not equal). To decide if that call (and its branch) is dead or always taken we need its exact semantics and return convention (what input cases yield success/failure) and whether it has side effects. If it is pure and always true for valid inputs, the call or branch might be dead.\n\n- MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_\n  - The percent-decoding call determines w and the error test ((0==w) && (0 != uname_ext_len - r)). To decide whether the error path or the zero-write case is reachable (dead), and whether the subsequent buf[w]=0 and final cast are always safe, we need the decoder's precise contract: when it returns 0, whether it can legitimately return 0 for non-empty input, whether it can overflow buf, and its return type semantics.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The assert line may abort in debug builds or be a no-op in production. To determine whether the assert is meaningful or constitutes dead code (an operation whose removal would not affect behavior), you must know the definition/behavior of mhd_assert in the build configurations of the project.\n\nNotes: the above symbols suffice to decide reachability of the function's branches and whether any executed operation can be removed without changing runtime behaviour. Internal helpers called by MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ (e.g. toxdigitvalue) are not required here if the decoder's external contract is known; conversely, if the decoder's contract is not documented, its implementation (and its callees) would also be required for a complete reachability/dead-code assessment."
