Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_: This function is called from the target and may contain for-loops whose behaviour would matter when checking MISRA\u2019s for-loop well-formedness (MISRA requires the body\u2019s called functions be considered). We must inspect its implementation to see if it contains for loops, modifies loop counters or has side effects relevant to the rule.\n\n- toxdigitvalue: Callee of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_. If the callee contains for-loops (or side-effecting operations used by any for-loop in its caller), those loops must be inspected; include this to allow transitive analysis of loops/side effects.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: Called in the target in a conditional. Even though the target uses a while, this function could itself contain for-loops or side effects; verify it is side-effect-free for purposes of evaluating any potential for-loop clauses and to ensure no hidden loop-counter modifications.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: Macro used to compute initial r and other lengths. Need its expansion to determine whether it is a pure, side-effect-free compile-time expression (so it cannot violate the MISRA clause about expressions with persistent side effects in loop clauses) and to know exact numeric bounds for loop analysis.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX: The constant/string whose length is used to set the loop start. Its value affects loop bounds and must be known to reason about loop iterations and to check whether any derived for-loop conditions could reference objects modified in the loop body.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN: Length constant used in an early return check. Its value affects whether loops execute; include to confirm it is a simple constant (no side effects) and to reason about loop-entry conditions.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX: Used in an overflow check/cast. Include to confirm it is a compile-time constant and does not introduce side effects; its value is relevant to correctness but also to show no for-loop clause uses objects with hidden side effects.\n\n- mhd_assert: Macro/function used after decoding. Inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand into code (for example, a for-loop or modification of identifiers) that would affect compliance with MISRA for-loop rules.\n\nRationale: The MISRA requirement being checked concerns the structure and side effects of for-loop clauses and the fact that called functions are semantically part of a for-loop body. Even though the target function contains a while loop rather than a for, to be thorough we must verify that any functions/macros called by the target do not themselves contain for-loops or side-effecting constructs that could interact with loop counters if the code were refactored, inlined, or if any for-loop appeared in macros. The listed symbols give the minimal set needed to inspect both direct calls and the relevant macros/constants that affect loop bounds and side-effect properties."
