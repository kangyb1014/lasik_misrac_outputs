The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count \u2014 direct callee of detect_cpu_core_count; its implementation must be examined because any for-loops inside it (or side effects it performs) would contribute to the overall behaviour relevant to MISRA\u2019s for-loop rule when those functions are called from inside a for statement in this function. Even though detect_cpu_core_count has no for loop now, verifying callees assures no hidden loop-related violations when code is moved/modified.\n\nmhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count \u2014 direct callee; same reason as above (possible for-loops or modifications to objects that could interact with loop control if a for loop were added or the function is inlined).\n\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_ \u2014 transitive callees of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count (appear in the static call graph). They must be checked for any for-loop constructs or side effects that could violate the MISRA rule when those routines are invoked from within a for loop (directly or via inlining) or that modify objects potentially used as loop counters/flags.\n\nmhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_ \u2014 transitive callees of mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count. Same rationale: examine for any for-loops or side effects that would affect compliance if called inside a for loop or if their behaviour is considered part of a for-loop body.\n\nMHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT \u2014 macro used as a fallback constant in detect_cpu_core_count. The macro expansion should be inspected to ensure it does not expand to an expression containing side effects or constructs that could count as illegal modifications to loop counters/flags (e.g., strange complex expressions or inline code that could introduce loops).\n\nfprintf, printf \u2014 library calls used in the function. While their typical implementations are not relevant, check whether they are macros or inline wrappers in this build (they can be platform-specific) and thus could contain side effects or loop constructs. If they are ordinary external functions, they do not affect the for-loop well-formedness of detect_cpu_core_count, but their declarations/definitions should be confirmed.\n\nNote: detect_cpu_core_count itself contains no for statements; the above symbols are listed so an analyst can confirm that none of the called/transitively-called functions or macros introduce for-loops or side effects that would affect MISRA C\u2019s for-loop well-formedness if detect_cpu_core_count were modified or if those callees were invoked from inside a for loop in this codebase."
