The earlier assertion mhd_assert (NULL != response->crc || NULL != response->data) only guarantees that at least one of response->crc or response->data is non-NULL; it does not guarantee that response->data covers the current rsp_write_position. If response->data is non-NULL but the condition testing whether the current rsp_write_position falls inside the contiguous data region fails, and response->crc is NULL, execution will take the else path and hit the NULL == response->crc branch. That is a perfectly feasible control path, so the code is not unreachable. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 forbids unreachable code; because this block is reachable, there is no Rule 2.1 violation here. (Side note: mhd_assert may be disabled in non-debug builds, but that only affects runtime checks, not reachability of the branch in the source.)"
