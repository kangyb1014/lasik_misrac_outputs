  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking use of language/compiler extensions:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN\n  Needed to inspect the macro expansion. Macros that control linkage/visibility commonly expand to compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, extern \"C\"). To verify the function declaration does not rely on a compiler extension we must see this definition.\n\n- enum MHD_Result\n  The return type may carry implementation-specific attributes or use nonstandard underlying-type annotations in its definition. Inspecting the enum ensures no extension (e.g. enum attributes or compiler-specific sized-enum annotations) is used.\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  The function accesses members of this struct; the struct definition must be checked for language extensions (unnamed/anonymous structs/unions, GCC extension members, attributes on the struct, zero-width bit-fields, flexible-array members with nonstandard syntax, packed/aligned attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct MHD_Response::flags_auto, struct MHD_Response::flags, struct MHD_Response::total_size\n  The code reads/writes these particular members. Their declarations (types, bit-field declarations, attributes) could contain extensions (for example bit-field types other than int, use of unnamed bit-fields, or GCC-specific attributes). We must inspect these member declarations specifically.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags\n  The flags type may be declared in a way that uses extensions (e.g. explicit underlying type, attribute annotations). Also the macros that test bits may rely on particular integer widths; checking the enum ensures no nonstandard construct is used.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions\n  Used with va_arg. We must confirm the enum definition and that it is safe/standard to pass and retrieve via varargs (no nonstandard promotions or attributes present). Also the sentinel value (MHD_RO_END) is an enum constant defined here.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE\n  These macros/constants are used in bitwise tests and influence control flow. Their definitions may hide use of language extensions (e.g. use of GCC statement-expressions, typeof, or inline assembly) or nonstandard literal suffixes/annotations; inspect them to ensure they are standard constants.\n\n- MHD_RO_END\n  The loop sentinel used with va_arg. Its definition must be examined to ensure it is a plain enum/integer constant and not defined via a compiler extension.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO\n  Return macros/constants. They may be defined via macros or as enum constants that could use compiler extensions (attributes, sized integers). Inspect to confirm they are standard.\n\n- stdarg macros/types (va_list, va_start, va_arg, va_end)\n  These are from the standard header <stdarg.h>. Although they are part of standard C, their use with an enum type via va_arg depends on standard promotion rules. Include the stdarg declarations to confirm standard usage and to detect any project overrides/wrappers that might use extensions.\n\nIn summary: to determine whether the function itself uses any language/compiler extensions you must inspect the macro/type/struct definitions referenced by the function signature and body, because those definitions are common places where compiler-specific extensions (attributes, storage-class macros, GNU extensions like statement-expressions/typeof, or nonstandard bit-field declarations) can be introduced."
