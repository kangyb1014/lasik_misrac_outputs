The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For accurate MISRA C 'well-formed for loop' analysis of the for loop in ws_receive_frame, the next analyser needs these symbols for the following reasons:\n\n- run_usock (caller source code): The caller shows exactly what objects are passed into ws_receive_frame for the parameters frame, length and type. MISRA rule 14.2 (the cited rule here) requires ensuring the loop's second clause does not use objects that are modified in the loop body \u2014 to check that we must know whether the length object comes from memory that could be modified (aliasing, overlapping buffers, or updated elsewhere). The caller also shows whether the ws_receive_frame path containing the for loop is actually reachable in real usage.\n\n- the actual variables/objects passed as the 'frame', 'length' and 'type' arguments in run_usock (their declarations/definitions): Knowing the names, types and storage locations of the exact objects passed (for example: local stack variables, heap buffers, or structure fields) is necessary to reason about possible aliasing between *length and the memory accessed in the loop body (frame[], msg[], masks[]). If *length aliases memory that is written in the loop body (directly or indirectly), the loop condition would be using an object modified by the loop body, violating clause 2. This symbol lets the analyser determine whether *length is independent from the buffer indexed by frame[i].\n\n- ssize_t typedef/declaration: The loop condition uses *length (ssize_t) and arithmetic involving data_length (size_t). Knowing the exact typedef (signed width) is necessary to reason about integer conversions, comparison semantics (signed/unsigned), and whether the condition i < *length legitimately only relies on loop counter(s) (clause 2) and does not invoke undefined behaviour via mixed signed/unsigned comparisons.\n\n- size_t typedef/declaration: data_length is size_t and is used to compute memory allocation and to assign back to *length after the loop. The analyser must check conversions and whether side effects or range issues could cause modifications that affect the for-loop's correctness relative to MISRA constraints.\n\n- WS_FIN, WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME, WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME macro definitions: These determine which branch is taken and therefore whether the loop is present in the executed path. While MISRA rules are evaluated on the code, knowing these macros helps determine reachability and whether the loop is conditioned by protocol checks. That context helps prioritise analysis (e.g., if branch is unreachable, the loop may still be non-compliant but the caller context is required to judge practical impact).\n\nNotes: local symbols inside ws_receive_frame (i, j, idx_first_data, masks, frame, msg, length, etc.) are present in the function source and already available. There are no function calls inside the loop body that could have hidden side effects; if run_usock or other caller code passes objects that could be modified concurrently or by interrupt/context then those definitions are necessary to conclude whether the for loop's second clause uses objects modified in the loop body. The listed symbols are the minimal additional items needed to determine whether the loop violates the cited MISRA requirements (notably the single-loop-counter constraint and the prohibition on using objects modified by the loop body in the loop condition)."
