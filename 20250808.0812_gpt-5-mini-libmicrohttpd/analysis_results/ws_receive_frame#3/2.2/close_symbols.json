Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- run_usock: This is the direct caller in the static call graph. To decide whether ws_receive_frame is dead you must inspect run_usock to see whether and under what conditions it calls ws_receive_frame (call sites, control flow and whether the call is reachable at runtime).\n- all callers of run_usock (e.g. main, thread entry points, event/callback registrars): If run_usock itself is never reachable from program entry points, ws_receive_frame may be dead. You must know every caller of run_usock (application entry points, event loop registrations, thread start routines) to determine overall reachability.\n- WS_FIN: Macro/constant used in the conditional tests inside ws_receive_frame. Its value (and any build-time redefinition) affects which branch is executed; understanding its value is required to know whether the text-frame branch (the main body) can ever be taken and thus whether that code is dead.\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: Same reason as WS_FIN \u2014 affects equality checks that select the text-frame processing path.\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: A second opcode checked by the function; knowing its value (and how opcodes are produced) is necessary to determine which branches are exercised.\n- malloc: The function allocates memory. Removal of the allocation or the call may change program behaviour (allocation failure handling, side-effects). To decide if code is removable without effect you must know allocation semantics or any project-specific allocator wrapper (see next item).\n- functions that produce/ fill the \"frame\" buffer in run_usock (e.g. socket read/recv/read_from_client): ws_receive_frame operates on the bytes in frame; to tell if its branches can execute you need the producer(s) of frame data and the encoding of bytes they produce (e.g. whether they ever produce values that satisfy the opcode tests). These symbols determine runtime values that make the function non-dead.\n- any wrapper or replacement for malloc used in the project (e.g. custom_alloc): If the project substitutes malloc with custom allocator or tracks allocations (side effects), removal of ws_receive_frame's allocation may change behaviour. Include any allocator wrapper to understand side-effects.\n\nCollecting these symbols (caller chain to program entry, the macros controlling branch selection, the frame producer(s), and allocation implementation) is sufficient to determine whether removing ws_receive_frame (or parts of it) would alter program behaviour, i.e., whether the code is dead under the MISRA rule."
