  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- sysconf\n  - The function calls sysconf. To determine whether the target function itself uses any <string.h> routines (or expands to calls to them via macros), you must know whether sysconf is the actual libc function or a macro/wrapper in this translation unit. If sysconf were a macro that expands to code that calls string.h functions, the MISRA rule could be implicated. Also the prototype (return type long) is needed to confirm the conversions in this routine \u2014 though that is not a string API, it affects whether additional checks/overflows occur.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN and _SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  - These constants are passed to sysconf. You must confirm they are simple integer macro constants (as expected) and not macros that expand to expressions or function-like constructs that could invoke string functions.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  - These preprocessor symbols control whether the sysconf branch is compiled. To analyze whether any string.h functions are used in the compiled code path you need to know which of these are defined in the build configuration; a different definition could include or exclude code that might contain string handling.\n\n- <unistd.h> (or the TU's declaration of sysconf)\n  - The header or local declaration shows whether sysconf is declared as a function or has been overridden by a macro/inline wrapper. Inspecting the declaration helps ensure no hidden expansions to string functions occur.\n\n- any local macro or wrapper that redefines sysconf in this translation unit\n  - Explicitly include any project-local symbol that could shadow/replace sysconf. If such a macro/wrapper exists and it calls memcpy/strcpy/etc., the MISRA string-handling rule could be violated even though the target function source text contains no explicit string.h calls.\n\nSummary: The target function contains no explicit calls to the <string.h> APIs. To confidently conclude it does not violate the MISRA string-handling rule you only need to inspect sysconf (and any macro/wrapper that could replace it) and the preprocessor symbols and constants that control whether the sysconf code is compiled. If sysconf is the plain libc call and no local macro expands into string operations, the target function does not itself use string.h functions and thus does not violate the stated MISRA rule."
