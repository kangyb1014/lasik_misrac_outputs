  "explanation": "Compare/check rationale for each symbol:\n\n- memcmp: This is the forbidden Standard Library function in the MISRA rule. The analysis must confirm that try_get_value does not call memcmp directly or indirectly (via wrappers), so memcmp itself must be available to check.\n\n- strlen: Called in try_get_value to compute klen. Some library implementations could use memcmp internally; to fully determine compliance you must inspect the strlen implementation or its declaration/semantics to ensure it does not rely on memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- strstr: Called in try_get_value to locate the key. strstr performs string matching and could conceivably use memcmp internally; include it so its implementation/behavior can be examined for indirect memcmp usage.\n\n- strchr: Called in try_get_value to find the end quote. strchr is another standard string routine to check for possible indirect use of memcmp in its implementation.\n\n- malloc: Allocates the destination buffer. While not directly related to memcmp, malloc is used in the function and should be present to reason about allocation success/failure and any wrappers that might hide comparisons; include it to allow full local-symbol analysis.\n\n- memcpy: Used to copy the found value into the destination buffer. Although memcpy copies rather than compares, include it to distinguish copy vs compare operations and to ensure no accidental use of memcmp-like compare semantics.\n\n- size_t: Type used for klen/vlen; include to resolve type-related reasoning about sizes and to inspect any macros or wrappers that might map to compare functions.\n\n- NULL: Macro used in the function's checks; include to resolve pointer/null semantics and to ensure there are no hidden macros that expand to compare calls.\n\nIn short: explicitly include the forbidden function (memcmp) plus all standard library functions and types used by try_get_value whose implementations or wrappers might hide uses of memcmp, so the next analyst can inspect direct and indirect (implementation/wrapper) uses and determine MISRA compliance."
