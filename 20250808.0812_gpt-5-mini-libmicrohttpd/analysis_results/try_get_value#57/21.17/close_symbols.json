  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C string-boundary analysis:\n\n- strlen: used to compute klen (key length). You must know its standard behaviour (reads through buf until NUL) to reason whether computing klen and indexing spos[klen] can read past key or buffer bounds.\n\n- strstr: used to find occurrences of key in buf. Its semantics determine whether the search can read beyond the provided buf object (it expects NUL-terminated strings) and whether returned pointer spos is always inside buf; this affects subsequent indexing (spos[klen], spos[-1], pointer arithmetic).\n\n- strchr: used to locate the closing quote starting at &spos[klen+2]. You must know that strchr scans for a NUL-terminated string and therefore may read past the intended end if buf is not NUL-terminated; its result (endv) is used to compute vlen and bounds for memcpy and the allocated buffer.\n\n- memcpy: the MISRA rule explicitly covers memcpy. You must check the size argument (vlen - 1) against the actual size of the source object (&spos[klen+2] up to endv) and the destination allocation to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- malloc: used to allocate *destination with size vlen. To ensure memcpy and the trailing NUL write are safe you need the semantics of malloc (returns at least the requested number of bytes or NULL) and to confirm vlen is computed correctly so allocation length covers the copied bytes plus terminator.\n\n- NULL: used in pointer comparisons and return checks (NULL != *destination, NULL == (endv = strchr(...)), NULL == *destination after malloc). You need the macro semantics to reason about error paths and whether writes occur.\n\n- size_t: used for klen and vlen and for arguments to memcpy/malloc; type/range information is needed to reason about integer under/overflow and correct sizing computations (e.g., vlen computed from pointer differences minus klen - 1).\n\n- process_multipart_headers: the caller that constructs/passes buf, key and destination. To decide whether string functions are used safely you must inspect how buf and key are produced (are they guaranteed NUL-terminated? do they come from bounded buffers?), how destination is initialized, and any preconditions that try_get_value relies on.\n\n- buf (argument passed into try_get_value): the safety of strlen, strstr and strchr depends on buf being a valid NUL-terminated string or having documented bounds. You must inspect the origin/constraints of buf to determine whether the string functions can read beyond the underlying object.\n\n- key (argument passed into try_get_value): must be a valid NUL-terminated string for strlen and strstr to behave correctly. Its value/length affects indexing (spos[klen]) and arithmetic used to compute vlen; if key is not well-formed this can lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- *destination (the pointer object written by try_get_value): the function checks NULL != *destination and writes into *destination after malloc. To ensure no out-of-bounds writes you must confirm the allocation size (vlen) matches the bytes copied (vlen - 1) plus the NUL terminator and that destination lifetime/overlap with source is appropriate for memcpy.\n\nIn short: to determine compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule you need the standard semantics of the used <string.h> functions (strlen, strstr, strchr, memcpy), the allocation behaviour (malloc), the type/macros used (size_t, NULL), and the caller(s)/origins of buf, key and destination (process_multipart_headers and the concrete provenance of those arguments) so you can verify all string traversals and pointer arithmetic stay within object bounds."
