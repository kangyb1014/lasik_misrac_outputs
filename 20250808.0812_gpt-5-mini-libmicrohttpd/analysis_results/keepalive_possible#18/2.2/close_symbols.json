  "explanation": "For dead\u2011code analysis we must know the program facts that make particular branches impossible or reachable and whether expressions have side effects. Each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function reads multiple connection fields (keepalive, rq.http_ver via rq, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error, rp.response). Knowing the exact fields and their types is required to determine possible values and whether checks are redundant.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: the code tests r->upgrade_handler, r->flags and r->flags_auto. To decide if those branches are ever taken (or always taken) we need the response layout and how those fields are manipulated elsewhere.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive and its values: the function returns these values; to decide whether returns are observable and used by callers (and hence whether some return paths are dead), the enum and its semantics are required.\n\n- mhd_assert: must know if mhd_assert has side effects (e.g. abort, logging) or is a no\u2011op in release builds. If it performs observable actions, its occurrences are not dead even if condition is always true/false.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci / MHD_lookup_header_token_ci: these calls determine branch decisions (presence of header tokens). We need the function signature and exact return semantics (NULL vs non\u2011NULL, side effects) to know whether the header checks are meaningful or can be removed.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION: the header name constant indicates which header is checked; needed to trace where that header is set/cleared in other code.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED and MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT and MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0: the function branches based on HTTP version checks. To tell if those branches are reachable (or always one outcome), the macros/constants and their exact semantics must be known.\n\n- Flag macros (MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER): these bit tests determine control flow. To decide if a test is dead, we must know where and how these flags are set/cleared elsewhere.\n\n- UPGRADE_SUPPORT: the presence/absence of this compile\u2011time macro changes which code is present. Dead\u2011code analysis must consider the actual build configuration.\n\n- add_response_header_connection and MHD_queue_response: comments assert that these functions enforce invariants (e.g. no CONNECTION: close token, valid HTTP version, flags_auto invariants). To determine whether the checks in keepalive_possible are redundant (dead) we need the specifications/implementations of the functions that establish those invariants.\n\n- setup_reply_properties, is_reply_body_needed, build_header_response: keepalive_possible is called from setup_reply_properties (and that caller chain may set/assume invariants or ignore certain return values). To check whether removing any statements in keepalive_possible would affect program behaviour we must inspect callers and the usage of its return value and any side effects.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and semantics) lets an analyzer determine which conditional tests or branches can never change observable behaviour (dead code) and which are required."
