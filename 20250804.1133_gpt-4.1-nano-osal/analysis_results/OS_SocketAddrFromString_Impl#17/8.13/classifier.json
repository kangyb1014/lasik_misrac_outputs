  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/139.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl(OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, const char *string)\n{\n    void *                  addrbuffer;\n    OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    Accessor = (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr;\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr;\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    /* This function is defined as returning 1 on success, not 0 */\n    if (inet_pton(Accessor->sa.sa_family, string, addrbuffer) != 1)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",

  "scenario": "A pointer 'addrbuffer' points to a field within the 'OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t' structure which is not const-qualified, but if the function needs to modify the data pointed to, then the pointer should not be to a 'const'-qualified type. In the given code, 'addrbuffer' points to address fields such as 'sin_addr' or 'sin6_addr' which are not const, and the function 'inet_pton' modifies the data at 'addrbuffer'. Therefore, the pointer correctly points to non-const data, and the usage complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.",
