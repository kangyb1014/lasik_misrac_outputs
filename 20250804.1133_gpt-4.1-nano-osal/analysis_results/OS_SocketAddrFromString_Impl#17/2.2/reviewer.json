  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The claim that there is dead code in the default case of the switch statement is valid. The default case executes a return statement unconditionally if the sa_family does not match AF_INET or AF_INET6, making subsequent code unreachable in that case. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 rules, as the code after the return in the default case can never be executed. The method provided with logging does not change the control flow structure that leads to dead code; it still contains an unconditional return in the default case. Therefore, the report about dead code in the default case is correct."
