  "explanation": "The agent claims that the use of 'pthread_mutex_lock' constitutes a language extension, which would violate MISRA C 2023 rule 1.2. However, 'pthread_mutex_lock' is part of the POSIX threads library, which is a POSIX standard, not a C language extension. MISRA C rule 1.2 addresses compiler-specific language extensions, not standard APIs like POSIX. Therefore, the use of 'pthread_mutex_lock' in this context does not violate rule 1.2."
