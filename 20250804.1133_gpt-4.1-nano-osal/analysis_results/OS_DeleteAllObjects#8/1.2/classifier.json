  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_DeleteAllObjects code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/64.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_DeleteAllObjects as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DeleteAllObjects:\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DeleteAllObjects:\nvoid UT_ExecuteBasicHandler(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, const char *FunctionName, UT_HandlerFunc_t DefaultHandler)\n{\n    /* Check if the test case registered a hook, and use the default if not */\n    if (UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_FINAL_HANDLER) == NULL && DefaultHandler != NULL)\n    {\n        UT_SetHandlerFunction(FuncKey, DefaultHandler, NULL);\n    }\n\n    UT_DefaultStubImpl(FunctionName, FuncKey, 0, NULL);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t matchfunc, void *matcharg, osal_objtype_t objtype,\n                              OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    iter->match = matchfunc;\n    iter->arg   = matcharg;\n    iter->limit = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(objtype);\n    iter->base  = &OS_common_table[OS_GetBaseForObjectType(objtype)];\n\n    return OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, objtype, &iter->token);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(OS_object_iter_t *iter, int32 (*func)(osal_id_t, void *))\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    /*\n     * This needs to temporarily unlock the global,\n     * call the handler function, then re-lock.\n     */\n    OS_Unlock_Global(&iter->token);\n    status = func(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(&iter->token), iter->arg);\n    OS_Lock_Global(&iter->token);\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(&iter->token);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
