  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The code contains a 'while (true)' loop with a break condition based on the variables ObjectCount and TryCount. The test output shows that ObjectCount remains at 0 from the very first iteration, prompting an immediate break after the first try. Since the loop terminates early and does not contain unreachable code after the break statement, the code does not violate MISRA C 2023 rule 2.1, which forbids unreachable code. Therefore, the scenario where unreachable code exists due to an infinite loop never breaking does not occur according to the provided test results."
