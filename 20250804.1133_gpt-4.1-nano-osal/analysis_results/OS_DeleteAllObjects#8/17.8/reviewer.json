  "explanation": "The function OS_DeleteAllObjects does indeed modify the object pointed to by the parameter 'ObjectCount' when calling OS_CleanUpObject via OS_ForEachObjectOfType and OS_ForEachObject. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, a function parameter should not be modified, which applies to parameters passed by pointer in this context. Since 'ObjectCount' is a pointer and its referenced object is being modified within those called functions, this constitutes a violation of Rule 17.8."
