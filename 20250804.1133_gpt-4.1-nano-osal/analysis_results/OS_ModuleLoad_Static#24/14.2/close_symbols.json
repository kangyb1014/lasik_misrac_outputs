The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is required to analyze how the StaticSym pointer iterates through the static symbol table, particularly whether it appropriately uses a loop counter or pointer without modifying loop variables improperly, complying with the 'well-formed for loop' rule. strcmp is needed to ensure that the comparison used in the loop condition does not cause side-effects or violate rule constraints. These symbols are directly involved in the loop's control and condition, which are critical for verifying adherence to the MISRA C rule."
