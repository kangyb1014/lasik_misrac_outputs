  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is: A project shall not contain unreachable code.\n\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_ModuleLoad_Static code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/193.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ModuleLoad_Static as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ModuleLoad_Static:\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleLoad_Static(const char *ModuleName)\n{\n    int32                      return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND;\n    OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym   = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE;\n\n    while (StaticSym != NULL)\n    {\n        if (StaticSym->Name == NULL)\n        {\n            /* end of list  */\n            break;\n        }\n        if (StaticSym->Module != NULL && strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0)\n        {\n            /* found matching module name */\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        ++StaticSym;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleLoad_Static:\n#define OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_ModuleLoad_Static code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code contains a 'break' statement within the 'while' loop after a certain condition, which causes the loop to exit early. If there were code after the loop that is unreachable due to this break, it would be unreachable code. However, in the provided code snippet, the loop terminates either upon a break or upon the 'while' condition becoming false, and there is no code after the loop that is unreachable. Therefore, no unreachable code exists.",
