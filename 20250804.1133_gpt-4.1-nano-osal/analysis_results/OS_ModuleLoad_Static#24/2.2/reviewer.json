  "explanation": "The code in question contains a loop that terminates under certain conditions. Specifically, the loop can exit via the 'break' statements when 'StaticSym->Name' is NULL or when a matching module is found. There is no infinite loop, nor is there code in the function that cannot be reached under any circumstances. The 'dead code' concept in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 refers to code that executes but whose removal would not affect program behavior, which is not the case here, as the loop controls and breaks determine actual execution flow. The added logging statements do not alter the control flow in a manner that would create dead code. Therefore, the claim that this function contains dead code and violates Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
