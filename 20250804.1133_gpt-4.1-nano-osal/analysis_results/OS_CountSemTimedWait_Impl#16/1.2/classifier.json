  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/128.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, uint32 msecs)\n{\n    struct timespec                     ts;\n    int                                 result;\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     ** Compute an absolute time for the delay\n     */\n    OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts);\n\n    if (sem_timedwait(&impl->id, &ts) == 0)\n    {\n        result = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else if (errno == ETIMEDOUT)\n    {\n        result = OS_SEM_TIMEOUT;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* unspecified failure */\n        result = OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
