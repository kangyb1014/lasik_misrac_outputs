  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report claims the presence of dead code in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl, suggesting that the second symbol lookup iteration may be redundant if the first always succeeds. However, the code logic explicitly shows that the second lookup is only performed if the first fails (`if (status != OS_SUCCESS)`). This indicates conditional execution based on runtime behavior, which aligns with the idea of necessary operational paths, not dead code. The dead code scenario would require code paths that are executed but do not influence program behavior, which the current code does not demonstrate. The additional logging code provided by the agent is designed to help verify whether the second lookup always executes or whether it can be skipped, but the presence of such logs does not inherently make the code dead. Also, compile errors in the test code do not imply dead code; they point to potential implementation issues outside the scope of MISRA rule 2.2 evaluation. Therefore, the original report claiming violation is not justified based on the provided code and scenario."
