  "explanation": "The scenario suggests that the pointer 'SymbolAddress' points to a non-const type ('cpuaddr'), and the functions called within 'OS_SymbolLookup_Impl' modify the object pointed to. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, if a pointer points to a 'const' type, it should not be used to modify the object. However, in this code, 'SymbolAddress' is a 'cpuaddr *', which is a non-const pointer, and the functions 'OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl' and 'OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl' are called with this pointer, presumably modifying the object. The scenario does not specify that 'SymbolAddress' was originally 'const', so the code seems consistent with the rule: the pointer is non-const and used for modification. The log code provided doesn't sufficiently support the scenario that 'SymbolAddress' was originally 'const'; instead, it demonstrates that the function intends to modify the object pointed to by 'SymbolAddress'. Therefore, the report that the code violates MISRA Rule 8.13 appears incorrect."
