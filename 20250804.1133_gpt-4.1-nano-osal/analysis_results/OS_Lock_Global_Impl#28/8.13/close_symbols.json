A pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "These symbols are required because they involve pointers and function calls that interact with pointers. Specifically, 'OS_impl_objtype_lock_table' is a pointer to a table of pointers, 'OS_impl_objtype_lock_t' is a structure that contains a pointer to mutex, 'pthread_mutex_lock' is a function that takes a pointer to a mutex, and 'strerror' is called with an integer representing an error number. Analyzing how pointers are used and whether any point to const-qualified types is essential for verifying compliance with the MISRA C rule."
