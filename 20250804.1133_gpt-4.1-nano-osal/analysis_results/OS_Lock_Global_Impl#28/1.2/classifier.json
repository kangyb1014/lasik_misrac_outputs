  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_Lock_Global_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/224.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_Lock_Global_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Lock_Global_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_Lock_Global_Impl(osal_objtype_t idtype)\n{\n    OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl;\n    int                     ret;\n\n    impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        ret = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mutex);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mutex): %s\", strerror(ret));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_Lock_Global_Impl code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
