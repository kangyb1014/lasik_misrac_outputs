The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint:\n```c\nbool OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint(void *ref, const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n    const char *                  target = (const char *)ref;\n    size_t                        mplen;\n\n    filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    if ((filesys->flags & OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL) == 0)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    mplen = OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt));\n\n    /*\n     * The virtual_mountpt member should be a substring of the search target.\n     * If this matches a basic substring check then it may be match\n     */\n    if (mplen == 0 || mplen >= sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) ||\n        strncmp(target, filesys->virtual_mountpt, mplen) != 0)\n    {\n        /* not a substring, so not a match */\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Confirm that the substring ends at either a directory separator\n     * or the end of string  (so exact mount points also match).\n     *\n     * For instance consider a virtual_mountpt of /mnt/abc and searching\n     * for target=/mnt/abcd - this should return false in that case.\n     */\n    return (target[mplen] == '/' || target[mplen] == 0);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",

  "scenario": "The code uses OS_strnlen on filesys->virtual_mountpt with sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) as the size parameter, which is safe provided that OS_strnlen correctly limits reads to that size. However, if OS_strnlen is a wrapper over strlen or a similar function that does not enforce bounds or if filesys->virtual_mountpt is not properly null-terminated within that buffer, it could lead to reading beyond the object bounds, violating MISRA 21.17. Additionally, the code passes the size of the buffer directly to OS_strnlen, which assumes that OS_strnlen behaves as a bounded length function, but this must be confirmed.",
