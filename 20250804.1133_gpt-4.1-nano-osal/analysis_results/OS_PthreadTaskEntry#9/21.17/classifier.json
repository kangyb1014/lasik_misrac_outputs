  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_PthreadTaskEntry code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/79.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_PthreadTaskEntry as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_PthreadTaskEntry:\n```c\nstatic void *OS_PthreadTaskEntry(void *arg)\n{\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    local_arg.opaque_arg = arg;\n    OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id); /* Never returns */\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_PthreadTaskEntry code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",
