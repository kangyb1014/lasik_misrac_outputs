  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_FileOpenCheck code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 14.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_FileOpenCheck.\n```c\nint32 OS_FileOpenCheck(const char *Filename)\n{\n    int32                        return_code;\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename);\n\n    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n    while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n        if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && (strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) == 0))\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The for loop directly iterates over elements with explicit control of the iteration state inside the loop, and the second clause (iteration condition) depends on a function call with potential side effects, such as 'OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter)'.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_FileOpenCheck(const char *Filename)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename);\n\n    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n    while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n        if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && (strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) == 0))\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_FileOpenCheck. The test suite might not cover this function or the test code might be not suitable to print important information.\n</test_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false)\n</response format>\n<instruction>   \nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The code uses a 'while' loop with the second clause being 'OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter)'. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2, the second clause should be a pure expression without side effects. Since 'OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext' is a function call that likely has side effects (advancing an iterator), this violates the rule. Consequently, the agent A's claim that the code violates MISRA 14.2 by using a function call in the second clause of the loop is valid."
