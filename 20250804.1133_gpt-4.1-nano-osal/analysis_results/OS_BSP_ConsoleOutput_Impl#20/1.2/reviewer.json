  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The code uses the 'write' system call, which is part of the POSIX standard. Since MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 prohibits language extensions, and 'write' is a system call provided by POSIX, its usage constitutes a language extension in MISRA's context. The test output shows 'write' being called repeatedly, indicating that its use persists despite the logging, which supports the agent A's claim. Therefore, the utilization of 'write' is considered a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
