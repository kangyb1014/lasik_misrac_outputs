  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_rewind:\n```c\nint lfs_file_rewind(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n\n    err = lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_rewind:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_file_rewind_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_seek_(lfs, file, 0, LFS_SEEK_SET);\n    if (res < 0) {\n        return (int)res;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        lfs_soff_t off, int whence) {\n    // find new pos\n    //\n    // fortunately for us, littlefs is limited to 31-bit file sizes, so we\n    // don't have to worry too much about integer overflow\n    lfs_off_t npos = file->pos;\n    if (whence == LFS_SEEK_SET) {\n        npos = off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_CUR) {\n        npos = file->pos + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_END) {\n        npos = (lfs_off_t)lfs_file_size_(lfs, file) + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    }\n\n    if (npos > lfs->file_max) {\n        // file position out of range\n        return LFS_ERR_INVAL;\n    }\n\n    if (file->pos == npos) {\n        // noop - position has not changed\n        return npos;\n    }\n\n    // if we're only reading and our new offset is still in the file's cache\n    // we can avoid flushing and needing to reread the data\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_READING)\n            && file->off != lfs->cfg->block_size) {\n        int oindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){file->pos});\n        lfs_off_t noff = npos;\n        int nindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &noff);\n        if (oindex == nindex\n                && noff >= file->cache.off\n                && noff < file->cache.off + file->cache.size) {\n            file->pos = npos;\n            file->off = noff;\n            return npos;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // write out everything beforehand, may be noop if rdonly\n    int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // update pos\n    file->pos = npos;\n    return npos;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The LFS_TRACE macro is defined to expand to nothing, so calls like LFS_TRACE(\"...\") are removed at preprocessing and produce no executed operations. Therefore there is no executed code in the project that could be removed without changing behaviour. (A violation would occur if trace calls compiled to an actual runtime operation with no effect \u2014 e.g. an empty function that is called \u2014 since that would be removable dead code.)"
