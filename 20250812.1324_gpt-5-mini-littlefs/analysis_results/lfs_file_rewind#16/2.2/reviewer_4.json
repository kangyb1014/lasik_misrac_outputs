The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of lfs_file_rewind.\n```c\nint lfs_file_rewind(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n\n    err = lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call to LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) in lfs_file_rewind expands to ((void)cfg), which is a no-op (casts to void, no side-effects). Removing that call would not change program behaviour in the provided configuration, so the operation is dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_probe_log_130(const char *stage, lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, int err) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/130.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    /* Attempt to log useful state: stage, pointers, err, and cfg pointer. */\n    void *cfg_ptr = NULL;\n    if (lfs) {\n        /* lfs->cfg is referenced in the original function (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK). */\n        cfg_ptr = (void*)lfs->cfg;\n    }\n    fprintf(f, \"probe: stage=%s lfs=%p file=%p err=%d cfg=%p\\n\",\n            stage, (void*)lfs, (void*)file, err, cfg_ptr);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint lfs_file_rewind(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        /* Log that lock failed and we are returning early. */\n        lfs_probe_log_130(\"lock_failed\", lfs, file, err);\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n\n    /* Log just before calling the internal rewind helper. */\n    lfs_probe_log_130(\"before_lfs_file_rewind_\", lfs, file, err);\n\n    err = lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind -> %d\", err);\n\n    /* Log state immediately before the unlock.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not sufficiently justified. The mere fact that LFS_UNLOCK expands to ((void)cfg) in one configuration does not automatically make the call \"dead code\" under MISRA 2.2. A few points:\n\n- (void)cfg is not purely syntactic noise: it evaluates the cfg expression. If cfg were a volatile object, an accessor with side-effects, or a macro that expands to a function call in some builds, the evaluation can affect behaviour. Even if it does not have side-effects, removing an executed statement can change timing, and MISRA Note 1 explicitly treats timing as part of program behaviour. Thus you cannot conclude that removal would not affect behaviour without deeper analysis.\n\n- MISRA Rule 2.2 applies to the project as built. If the macro is intentionally a no-op in this configuration for portability/conditional compilation but performs locking in other configurations, its presence is justified for API symmetry and configurability. That design intent and possible alternate configurations are relevant to assessing whether the code is truly dead in the project.\n\n- The provided evidence (a probe that produced no logs) is insufficient to prove the call has no effect: the test run may not have executed this function, or the probe may be unsuitable. There is no demonstrated proof that removing the LFS_UNLOCK call would not change the behaviour in the built project.\n\nTherefore the report that lfs_file_rewind violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct as presented. If you can show that in the concrete project build the macro expansion neither evaluates any observable object nor affects timing or any externally visible behaviour, then the call could be classified as dead code and should be addressed. Otherwise, the claim is not supported."
