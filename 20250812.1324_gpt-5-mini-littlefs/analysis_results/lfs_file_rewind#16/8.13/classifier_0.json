  "scenario": "No violation: casting lfs and file to (void*) here is only for printing their addresses. MISRA\u2011C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (a pointer should be to a const\u2011qualified type when possible). This line performs an adhoc cast for tracing and does not remove a const qualifier from an existing declaration. A real violation would occur if the parameters (or the LFS_TRACE prototype) were declared as non\u2011const pointers even though they could be const (or if this cast stripped an existing const qualification)."
