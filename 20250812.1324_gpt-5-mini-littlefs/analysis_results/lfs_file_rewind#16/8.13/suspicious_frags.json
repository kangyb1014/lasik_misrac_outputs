  "explanation": "Lines not listed do not involve pointer types that could reasonably be const-qualified and thus are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The local variable 'err' and its integer comparisons/returns are non-pointer operations and cannot be made const-qualified pointers. The trace of the return value (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind -> %d\", err);) and the final 'return err;' do not use pointer parameters and therefore are outside the scope of pointer const-qualification. No other expressions in the function create or pass pointers whose const qualification could plausibly be tightened beyond those already flagged above."
