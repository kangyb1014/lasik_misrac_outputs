  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function accepts lfs_t *lfs and lfs_file_t *file and calls LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file). lfs_file_rewind is expected to modify the file object (rewind its position) and may modify the filesystem state via lfs, so the pointers must be non-const. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated. (If, instead, neither *lfs nor *file were ever modified, then making the parameters const-qualified would be required and the current prototype would violate the rule.)"
