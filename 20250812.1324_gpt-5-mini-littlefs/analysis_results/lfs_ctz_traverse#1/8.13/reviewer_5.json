  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when that is possible from the interface point of view. In this function the pointer 'data' is forwarded to the callback 'cb' and the callback type is declared as taking a void* (non-const). Because the function must preserve the declared callback prototype, lfs_ctz_traverse cannot safely change its own parameter to a pointer-to-const without also changing the callback type (and all callers) \u2014 i.e. the interface itself permits modification via cb. The runtime log simply shows one test run where the callback did not mutate the pointed-to data; runtime evidence does not overcome the static-interface constraint MISRA addresses. If the API (cb signature) and all call sites were changed so that the callback takes a pointer-to-const, then both cb and data should be const-qualified and would satisfy 8.13. As written, however, there is no demonstrable MISRA 8.13 violation in this isolated function."
