  "explanation": "Only pointer-related constructs that could plausibly be const-qualified were selected for investigation. Fragments not listed do not introduce additional pointer targets that could be made const, or they require mutable storage by design: for example, the local array 'heads' is used as an output buffer (written to by the block read and then modified), so those uses must be with a non-const target; pcache is already declared const; scalar variables (size, index, head, count, err, i) are non-pointer types and therefore outside the scope of Rule 8.13; byte-order conversion and assignments to the heads array are normal mutations of local storage and do not indicate missing const qualifications. The listed fragments capture all parameter declarations and call-sites where non-const pointers are introduced or passed and therefore should be reviewed for possible const-qualification per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
