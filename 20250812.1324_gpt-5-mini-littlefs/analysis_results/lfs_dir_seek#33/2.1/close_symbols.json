  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in lfs_dir_seek is unreachable you must know the behavior of the called macros/functions and the callee: \n- LFS_LOCK: determines the early-return path (err != 0). Need its definition/semantics to know when/if the if(err) return branch can be taken (e.g. if it always returns 0 then the early return is unreachable). \n- LFS_UNLOCK: appears after the call to lfs_dir_seek_; if the callee never returns (noreturn/abort/longjmp/exit), the unlock call (and subsequent return) would be unreachable. Need the unlock implementation to see if it affects control flow or is expected to be paired with LFS_LOCK. \n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro could, in principle, affect control flow if implemented unusually (e.g. assert/abort/longjmp). Need its definition to confirm it does not make code unreachable. \n- lfs_dir_seek_: the direct callee \u2014 must inspect its implementation and attributes (does it always return? can it abort/longjmp/exit?) because its behavior directly determines reachability of LFS_UNLOCK and the final return in lfs_dir_seek. \n- lfs_dir_rewind_, lfs_min, lfs_pair_cmp, lfs_dir_fetch: these are callees used by lfs_dir_seek_. To determine whether lfs_dir_seek_ can return normally you may need to inspect these functions (or their attributes) for noreturn/abort/longjmp behavior that would make code after the call in lfs_dir_seek unreachable.\n\nProvide these definitions/implementations (or documented attributes such as noreturn) to the analyzer so it can determine whether any lines in lfs_dir_seek are provably unreachable under the project code base."
