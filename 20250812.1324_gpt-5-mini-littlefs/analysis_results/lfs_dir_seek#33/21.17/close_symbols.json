  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_seek_: The target delegates to this function; any use of string.h functions that could violate bounds will appear here. You must inspect its implementation.  \n- lfs_dir_rewind_: Called by lfs_dir_seek_; it may reset buffers/indices or call string functions and affect bounds checks.  \n- lfs_min: Often used to compute copy/compare lengths; its definition/behavior is needed to verify length calculations used before string.h calls.  \n- lfs_pair_cmp: Comparison helper that may use memcmp or similar; inspect to see whether it calls string.h functions on buffers and whether lengths are validated.  \n- lfs_dir_fetch: Fetches directory entries into buffers; likely location of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* usage and needs full inspection.  \n- lfs_t (type/struct): The layout and any buffer fields in lfs_t (and related cfg) are needed to determine the sizes/ownership of memory passed to string functions.  \n- lfs_dir_t (type/struct): Must know the member names, pointer types and buffer sizes (e.g. cached entry buffers, pair fields) to determine whether string.h calls access beyond object bounds.  \n- lfs_off_t (type): Needed to interpret offset arithmetic and range checks used when computing copy/compare lengths.  \n- definitions of the buffer/field members of lfs_dir_t and any buffers in lfs_t that dir-related functions write to (names/sizes): Concrete buffer sizes and member semantics are required to verify that any memcpy/strcpy/etc. use correct length arguments and do not overflow.  \n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst find all places string.h functions may be called and verify the pointer targets and length arguments against actual object bounds."
