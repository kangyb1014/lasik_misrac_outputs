  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro (or inline) that expands to code which assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variable(s) (for example if written incorrectly as LFS_LOCK(lfs) -> (lfs)=... ). To prove the target function does not modify its parameters you must inspect the exact definition/expansion.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/implementation may perform assignments or side-effects that change the pointer parameters in the caller when implemented as a macro.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Often a macro; its expansion might evaluate or even alter arguments (e.g. via statement expressions or temporary assignments). You must check its definition to ensure it does not assign to lfs, dir or off (which would violate the MISRA rule if it modified the formal parameters in the caller through macro expansion).\n\n- lfs_dir_seek_: Although called as a function, it could be a macro/inline that expands in-place and thereby modify the caller's parameter variables. Inspecting its definition ensures the call is a regular function call (no parameter-variable modifications via macro expansion) and that the target function itself does not modify its parameters.\n\n- lfs_t: The layout/type of lfs is required to check how lfs->cfg is used by the macros/functions above and to confirm that no unexpected macro uses the lfs identifier in a way that reassigns it.\n\n- lfs_dir_t: The type of dir is required for the same reason \u2014 to inspect any macro/function definitions that take dir and ensure they do not modify the dir parameter variable.\n\n- lfs_off_t: The type of off (passed by value) is needed to confirm there are no macros that rely on or rebind the identifier off in a way that modifies the parameter variable.\n\nIn short: inspect the exact definitions (or macro expansions) of the listed macros/functions and the involved types to confirm none perform assignments to the formal parameter identifiers (lfs, dir, off) in the scope of lfs_dir_seek, which would violate the MISRA rule.
