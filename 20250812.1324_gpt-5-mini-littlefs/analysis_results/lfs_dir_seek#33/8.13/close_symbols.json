  "explanation": "Brief justification for each symbol (why needed for MISRA pointer-const analysis):\n- lfs_dir_seek_: The target delegates all work to this helper. Its prototype/definition shows whether it mutates the objects pointed to (lfs, dir) or already declares them const \u2014 central to deciding if the public wrapper parameters can be const.\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: Called by lfs_dir_seek_. Its prototype/definition reveals whether it modifies the directory state (through lfs_dir_t*) \u2014 if it mutates dir, dir cannot be const.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Same reason as lfs_dir_rewind_ \u2014 it may read/modify directory entries; its parameter constness and body determine whether dir can be const.\n- lfs_min: Utility used by lfs_dir_seek_. Its prototype indicates whether it takes pointer arguments as const; helps determine if values passed are intended to be immutable.\n- lfs_pair_cmp: Comparator utility used by lfs_dir_seek_. Its prototype/definition shows whether it accepts const pointers (common for comparison functions) \u2014 informs whether data should be const-qualified.\n- lfs_t: Full definition of the filesystem state struct is needed to see which members are modified by callees and to judge whether taking lfs as const is feasible.\n- lfs_dir_t: Full definition of the directory state struct is needed to see which fields are modified by callees and whether the directory object can be const.\n- lfs_off_t: Type definition (and semantics) of the offset parameter; while not a pointer, its definition may show related APIs that require mutable state and inform constness decisions.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg struct): The member passed into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. Knowing its type is necessary because locking APIs may modify the config/lock state; that can prevent making lfs const if those ops require mutating members.\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro or function definition/prototype \u2014 it is invoked with lfs->cfg; if it mutates the cfg or requires a non-const pointer, that constrains const qualification of lfs.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlock may mutate lock state and thus affect whether lfs (or its cfg member) can be const.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro definition \u2014 although unlikely to mutate the objects, its prototype may cast or take pointers non-const; include to be certain that tracing does not force non-const parameter types.\n\nCollecting these prototypes/definitions and the implementations of the internal callees is required to determine whether any pointer parameters in lfs_dir_seek can safely be declared to point to const-qualified types without violating usage in the call chain (MISRA rule)."
