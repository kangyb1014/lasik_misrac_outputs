  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of the standard memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. You must locate any uses of memcmp reachable from the target to decide if a forbidden comparison occurs.\n- lfs_fs_size_: The target calls this function; any memcmp usage inside it would make the target function violate the rule. The body of lfs_fs_size_ must be examined.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this function (per the call graph). memcmp could be used deeper in this call chain, so lfs_fs_traverse_ must be inspected as well.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro/function is invoked by the target. Although unlikely, it could expand to code that uses memcmp (or wrappers that do). Inspecting its definition ensures no hidden memcmp string comparisons are introduced by tracing.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These locking macros/functions are called by the target. Their definitions should be checked to ensure they do not internally call memcmp (or wrappers that compare null-terminated strings).\n\nScan these symbols (and any additional functions they call) for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings. If memcmp is used, determine whether its operands are null-terminated strings; that is the MISRA violation to detect."
