  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_fs_size uses compiler language extensions you must inspect the macros, types, and called implementation it relies on (macros can expand into extensions).  Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are invoked in the function. They may be macros (not functions) and could expand to compiler extensions (inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }), GCC/Clang __attribute__s, typeof, non-standard builtins, or variadic/concatenation tricks). You need their definitions to see if any extension is used.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is used for logging and commonly implemented as a macro that may use variadic macros, GNU extension statement-expressions, __func__, or other non\u2011standard features. Its definition is required to determine whether it uses language extensions.\n\n- lfs_trace (or the underlying function used by LFS_TRACE): If LFS_TRACE expands to a function call, the function implementation or prototype may itself use extensions (e.g., varargs handling, attributes). Inspecting the underlying function clarifies whether any extension is used indirectly.\n\n- lfs_fs_size_: The target directly calls this helper. If the helper is a macro or inline function, or uses extensions that affect observable behavior or ABI, you must inspect it. Even if it is a normal function, its signature or inline attributes could be non-standard.\n\n- lfs_t (full struct/type): The expression lfs->cfg and the cast (void*) involve the type layout. The type definition could contain compiler-specific extensions (bitfields with implementation-defined sizes, anonymous structs/unions, GCC extensions like __extension__ or transparent_union) that would trigger the rule. You must inspect the concrete type definition.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg: The cfg member\u2019s type (often a pointer to a config struct) may be a typedef or macro that hides extensions; its definition is needed to rule out use of extensions there.\n\n- lfs_ssize_t: The return type is a typedef; its underlying type must be checked (it may be typedef'd to a compiler-specific type or use compiler-specific attributes) and to verify correct use of PRId32 formatting.\n\n- PRId32 (from <inttypes.h>): The code uses the PRId32 macro inside the format string. Although PRId32 is standardized in C99, some platforms define it in non-standard ways or as non-string tokens. You need the actual definition in your build to ensure no compiler-specific extension is being used in the format construction.\n\n- Header(s) defining the LFS_* macros: Macros are usually defined in project headers. Include those headers so the analyzer can see macro expansions and any conditional use of compiler-specific constructs.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows an analyzer to expand macros, inspect typedefs and member declarations, and determine whether any part of the target function (including expansions it depends on) uses documented compiler language extensions."
