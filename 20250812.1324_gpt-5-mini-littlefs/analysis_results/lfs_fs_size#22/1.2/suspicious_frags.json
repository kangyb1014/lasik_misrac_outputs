  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n- PRId32 is a standard C99 inttypes.h printf macro, not a compiler extension.\n- The variadic macro usage (LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__)) uses the standard C99 __VA_ARGS__ facility; its empty replacement is a valid macro definition, not an extension.\n- The comma operator ((void)cfg, 0) and the (void) cast are standard C and not extensions.\n- There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expression ({ ... }), inline assembly (__asm__), long double suffixes, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The ellipses (\u2026) seen in the snippet are truncation/placeholders in the provided excerpt, not code using extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you can provide more of the surrounding code (where omitted with ...), I can re-check those parts for any compiler-specific extensions."
