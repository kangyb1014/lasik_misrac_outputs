  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/implementation determines what value is assigned to err and whether it can longjmp/abort/never return. If LFS_LOCK always returns a non-zero constant or never returns normally, the subsequent code may be unreachable.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: needed to check whether the call after lfs_fs_size_ is reachable or has side effects that influence reachability (and to check whether unlocking is conditional or implemented as a noreturn/abort).\\n- LFS_TRACE: logging/assert macros can expand to code that aborts/longjmps (or to nothing). Its definition is required to determine whether the two trace calls could make following statements unreachable.\\n- lfs_fs_size_: the called helper may be marked noreturn or contain calls that never return; its prototype/definition (and attributes) are required to determine if code after the call (the second LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return) is unreachable.\\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this function; its definition/attributes are required if it (or functions it calls) can prevent lfs_fs_size_ from returning.\\n- lfs_t / lfs->cfg definition: needed to fully interpret LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macro expansions (they often take cfg as argument) and understand any cfg-specific behavior that affects reachability.\\n- lfs_ssize_t typedef: to know return-type semantics (special values, signed/unsigned) if that matters for constant-return analysis.\\n- function/variable attributes (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn)) or compiler pragmas): compiler-level annotations on any of the above symbols can directly make subsequent code unreachable and must be known for a correct MISRA unreachable-code judgment."
