  "scenario": "The code casts the lfs_t * pointer to (void*) for use with a %p trace/printf. Rule 8.13 concerns qualifying pointed-to types with const where possible; this cast is only for printing. The function parameter lfs is not declared const (and likely must remain non-const because the filesystem object may be modified), and the %p format expects a void* (not const void*). Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
