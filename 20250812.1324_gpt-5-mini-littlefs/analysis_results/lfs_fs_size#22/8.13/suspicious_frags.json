  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce or pass pointer types that could require const qualification. Specifically: the control flow (if (err) { return err; }), the return statements, and the trace that prints an integer value (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size -> %\"PRId32, res);) involve non-pointer scalar types and thus are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. Local variable declarations of non-pointer types (int err, lfs_ssize_t res) also do not apply. The suspicious fragments listed cover all places in this function where pointer-typed objects are declared, accessed, or passed and therefore merit investigation to determine whether the pointed-to types could be const-qualified."
