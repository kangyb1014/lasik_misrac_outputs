  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code frees lfs->lookahead.buffer only when no user-supplied buffer (lfs->cfg->lookahead_buffer) is provided. The buffer being freed is owned and mutable, so its pointer must not be const; likewise the cfg pointer represents a (potentially writable) user buffer and thus is expected to be non-const. Therefore there is no failure to qualify a pointer as const here."
