  "explanation": "Lines not listed do not involve pointer types, pointer casts, or pointer arguments that could reasonably be const-qualified and therefore do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically: the local integer variable and its simple checks/returns (int err, if (err) { return err; }, LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_close -> %d\", err); return err;) do not affect pointer const-qualification and are not relevant to this rule. No other pointer uses appear outside the fragments already reported."
