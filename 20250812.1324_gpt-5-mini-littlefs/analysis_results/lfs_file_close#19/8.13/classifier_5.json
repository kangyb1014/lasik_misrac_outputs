  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: the statement only reads a member and calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); it does not declare or define a pointer type. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when possible, so from this single expression we cannot conclude a violation. (If, in the broader code, lfs->cfg is a pointer to a non-const object that is only read by LFS_LOCK, then making it a pointer-to-const would be preferable and would be a scenario where Rule 8.13 could be violated.)"
