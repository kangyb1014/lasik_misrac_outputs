  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_open:\n```c\nint lfs_file_open(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, const char *path, int flags) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_open(%p, %p, \\\"%s\\\", %x)\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, path, (unsigned)flags);\n    LFS_ASSERT(!lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    err = lfs_file_open_(lfs, file, path, flags);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_open -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_open:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_file_open_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        const char *path, int flags) {\n    static const struct lfs_file_config defaults = {0};\n    int err = lfs_file_opencfg_(lfs, file, path, flags, &defaults);\n    return err;\n}\n...\ntypedef struct lfs_file {\n    struct lfs_file *next;\n    uint16_t id;\n    uint8_t type;\n    lfs_mdir_t m;\n\n    struct lfs_ctz {\n        lfs_block_t head;\n        lfs_size_t size;\n    } ctz;\n\n    uint32_t flags;\n    lfs_off_t pos;\n    lfs_block_t block;\n    lfs_off_t off;\n    lfs_cache_t cache;\n\n    const struct lfs_file_config *cfg;\n} lfs_file_t\n...\nstruct lfs_mlist {\n        struct lfs_mlist *next;\n        uint16_t id;\n        uint8_t type;\n        lfs_mdir_t m;\n    }\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) macro expands to ((void)lfs->cfg); which evaluates the expression and discards it. It has no side effects for the given lfs->cfg (plain member access) and therefore its execution does not affect program behaviour; removing the statement would not change behaviour. Thus this statement is dead code in the current configuration and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If LFS_UNLOCK were defined to perform a real unlock in another configuration, it would not be dead, but in the provided definitions it is.)"
