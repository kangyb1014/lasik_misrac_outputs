  "explanation": "For determining whether lfs_file_tell uses any compiler language extensions, the analyzer needs the definitions/implementations of the following symbols:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: a macro/function used for locking. It may expand to compiler-specific intrinsics, attributes, inline assembly, or builtin functions (extensions). You must inspect its definition to detect any non-standard constructs.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK (unlock implementation may use compiler extensions).\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro used with format and variadic arguments. Its definition may use variadic-macro syntax, GCC extensions (e.g. statement expressions, __attribute__, __builtin_*), or other extension features; inspect it.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may employ compiler-specific pragmas, builtin_expect, statement-expressions, or other extensions \u2014 check its definition.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: the function called inside LFS_ASSERT; its prototype/definition is required to verify no extension usage (e.g. inline, attributes, unusual parameter types, or nonstandard casts).\n- lfs_file_tell_: the actual implementation called and returned by lfs_file_tell; must be inspected for any language extensions inside its code or signature.\n- lfs_soff_t: the return type; its typedef may use compiler-specific integer types or attributes (e.g. typedef long long __attribute__((...))). Type definition must be checked.\n- lfs_t: the filesystem context type (used as lfs and lfs->cfg); its definition is needed to see if any fields or embedded types use extensions.\n- lfs_file_t: the file handle type (used as file); inspect its typedef/definition for extensions.\n- struct lfs_mlist: used in the cast in the LFS_ASSERT call; its definition is needed to ensure the cast is standard and no extension-specific layout/attributes are used.\n- PRId32: the integer-format macro used in the LFS_TRACE format string. Although PRId32 is from standard inttypes.h, its definition or any project redefinitions should be checked to ensure no nonstandard/extension behaviour is introduced.\n\nTogether these symbols cover macros, types, and callees that could hide compiler-specific language extensions; they must be examined to decide MISRA conformance for the target function."
