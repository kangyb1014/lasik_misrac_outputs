  "explanation": "The claimed unreachable code is the branch \"if (err) { return err; }\". If, in the delivered build, the macro LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is defined as ((void)cfg, 0) (i.e. it always evaluates to 0), then err is always 0 and that if-branch can never be taken. Under those circumstances the code is indeed unreachable and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (a project shall not contain unreachable code).\n\nA few clarifications: the empty test log does not disprove the reachability argument \u2014 it only shows the test did not exercise the function. Whether this is a rule violation depends on the actual project configuration: if LFS_LOCK is truly a constant-zero no-op in the delivered project, the report is correct. If LFS_LOCK can be defined differently in other configurations so that err may be non-zero, then the branch is not necessarily unreachable and there is no violation in the general source (only in specific build configurations). To address the situation consistently, either remove the dead branch for the no-lock configuration or guard it with an appropriate #if so the source does not contain unreachable code in the delivered build configuration."
