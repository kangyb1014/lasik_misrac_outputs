  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_tell:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_tell:\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n    return file->pos;\n}\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for-loop declares and initializes a single loop counter (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head). The second clause (*p) is a side-effect-free test that uses only the loop counter. The third clause (p = &(*p)->next) modifies only the loop counter (p) and only reads members of the list nodes; nothing modified in the loop body is used by the condition or increment. The loop counter is not modified in the body. Therefore the fragment complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
