  "scenario": "The statement is an assertion macro. As written it is not necessarily dead code because an assertion can have observable behaviour (e.g. logging/abort) and removing it could change program behaviour on assertion failure. However, if LFS_ASSERT is defined away to a no-op in production (for example #define LFS_ASSERT(x) ((void)0)) and the expression lfs_mlist_isopen(...) has no side effects, then the whole operation would be dead code: it would be executed only in debug builds but its removal would not affect the program behaviour in the builds where it is present, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Without the definition of LFS_ASSERT and knowledge of whether lfs_mlist_isopen has side effects, the rule cannot be conclusively determined. If you assume the common pattern where assertions may abort on failure, then is_rule_violated = false; if you assume the macro is compiled out and the checked call has no side effects, then is_rule_violated = true."
