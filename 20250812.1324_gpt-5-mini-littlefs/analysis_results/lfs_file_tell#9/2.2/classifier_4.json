Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_tell:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement is a logging call (LFS_TRACE) that produces observable side-effects (emits diagnostic output and influences timing). Removing it would change system behaviour (observability and possibly timing), so it is not dead code. A violation would only occur if LFS_TRACE were implemented as an executed operation with no side-effects (for example a call to a function that does nothing and whose result is discarded); in that hypothetical case the operation would be executed but removable without changing program behaviour, and thus would violate Rule 2.2."
