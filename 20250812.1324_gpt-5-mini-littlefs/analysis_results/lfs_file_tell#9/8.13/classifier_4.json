  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated based on the fragment. The line int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); merely uses the existing pointer lfs->cfg \u2014 it does not declare a pointer type that should be const-qualified. There is no evidence here that lfs->cfg could or should be const: LFS_LOCK likely mutates or requires a mutable cfg (or a locking API that accepts a non-const pointer). If, in the wider codebase, lfs->cfg is declared as a non-const pointer but all call sites (including LFS_LOCK) do not modify the pointed object, then that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to point to a const-qualified type. However, from this single fragment alone there is no concrete violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
