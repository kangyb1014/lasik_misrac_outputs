  "scenario": "The cast in the trace call simply prints pointer values: LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file). There is no evidence here that the pointees could/should be const-qualified: the function subsequently uses lfs and file in potentially mutating operations (locks, assertions and a call to lfs_file_tell_). Also %p expects a void* so the cast is appropriate for printing. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
