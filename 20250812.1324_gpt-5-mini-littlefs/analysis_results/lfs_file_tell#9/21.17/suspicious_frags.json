  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code fragments. The function lfs_file_tell only calls LFS_LOCK, LFS_ASSERT, LFS_TRACE, lfs_file_tell_, and LFS_UNLOCK; none of these expand to or call string.h functions in the supplied definitions (LFS_TRACE is empty, LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are no-ops, LFS_ASSERT maps to assert). lfs_file_tell_ simply returns file->pos without performing any buffer or string operations. lfs_mlist_isopen iterates a linked list using pointer comparisons and does not dereference or copy string/byte buffers; its loop accesses are pointer traversal only and do not involve the standard string functions. The struct definitions contain fields and arrays but no code that operates on them with string.h functions in the provided snippets. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (accesses beyond object bounds caused by string.h functions). If you have other parts of the codebase that call any of the listed string.h functions, please provide them for inspection."
