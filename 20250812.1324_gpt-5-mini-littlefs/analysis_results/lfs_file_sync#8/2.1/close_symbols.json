  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for unreachable code in lfs_file_sync:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The first statement assigns err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). Whether the subsequent if (err) { return err; } is reachable depends on the precise definition/expansion of LFS_LOCK (constant value, side-effects, or non-returning behavior). Must inspect to determine if the early-return branch is possible or always taken/never taken.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called unconditionally near the end. If LFS_UNLOCK can be non-returning or if its semantics require being paired with LFS_LOCK, its definition is needed to see whether code after/around it is reachable or removed by macros.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Wraps the call to lfs_mlist_isopen. LFS_ASSERT may expand to a runtime-check that aborts/longjmps or to an empty/no-op in some builds. Its definition determines whether subsequent code is reachable when the asserted condition fails or in certain build modes.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro used before/after the core call. Some trace macros expand to no code; others may include control flow or side-effects. Include to rule out build-time removal or control-flow changes that could make nearby lines unreachable.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: The asserted predicate passed to LFS_ASSERT. If this function (or its return value) is constant in all builds, or has side-effects that change control flow (unlikely but possible), it affects reachability of the code following the assert.\n\n- lfs_file_sync_: The core callee whose behavior determines reachability of the trailing LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK and return. If lfs_file_sync_ never returns (e.g., infinite loop, abort, longjmp) then the subsequent lines are unreachable. Its definition must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_file_flush, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_bd_sync, lfs_ctz_tole32, lfs_dir_commit: These are the static callees of lfs_file_sync_. They must be examined because lfs_file_sync_ may call one of them and they could contain non-returning behavior (abort/longjmp/infinite loop) or otherwise affect whether lfs_file_sync_ returns.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: The target function accesses lfs->cfg and passes lfs and file to callees/macros. The struct/type definitions may be needed to resolve how cfg is used by LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK and to understand any compile-time constant or macro interactions that could make code unreachable.\n\nTogether these symbols cover macros that can change control flow (LOCK/UNLOCK/ASSERT/TRACE), the asserted predicate, the main callee and its callees (which could prevent return), and the relevant types; all are necessary to decide whether any statements in lfs_file_sync are provably unreachable."
