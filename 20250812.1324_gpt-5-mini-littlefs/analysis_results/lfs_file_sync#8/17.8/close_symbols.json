  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201ca function parameter shall not be modified\u201d we must be sure no code reachable from the call site (including macros) assigns to the parameter variables 'lfs' or 'file'. Each symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to the local parameter variable (e.g. 'lfs' or 'file'). We need its definition to verify it does not modify the function parameters.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it may be a macro or inline routine that could (maliciously or accidentally) assign to parameter identifiers. Its definition is required to confirm no parameter modification.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros often expand inline and can contain statements. We need its definition to confirm it only reads the parameters (casts to void*) and does not assign to 'lfs' or 'file'.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro definitions can contain side-effects or assignments in pathological implementations. Inspecting its definition ensures it does not modify the parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_file_sync_: It's called with the parameters. If lfs_file_sync_ is actually a macro (or an inline that expands into code in this translation unit) it could directly assign to the caller's parameter variable names; therefore its definition/prototype and body (or macro expansion) must be checked. If it's a normal function, its internal reassignments would not violate the rule for the caller, but checking the symbol confirms which case applies.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called inside LFS_ASSERT with a cast of 'file'. If this is a macro, it could modify parameter identifiers; we need its definition to ensure it is a pure call/expression and does not assign to 'file' or 'lfs'.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): We need the layout and definitions of lfs_t (fields such as cfg and mlist) to resolve uses like lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist, and to inspect any macros that might expand to use these field names in a way that assigns to the parameter object itself versus its pointed-to fields.\n\n- lfs_file_t (typedef/definition): Knowing the actual typedef/definition ensures the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) is legitimate and lets us confirm there are no unusual macro typedefs that could cause text-substitution-based assignment to the parameter name.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): Required to verify the lfs_mlist_isopen call and any casts do not rely on macro tricks that could modify the 'file' parameter token.\n\nTogether these symbols let the reviewer determine whether any macro expansions or inline code reachable from lfs_file_sync assign to the parameter variables 'lfs' or 'file' (which would violate the MISRA rule), or whether all uses are reads or modifications of the objects pointed-to (which are allowed)."
