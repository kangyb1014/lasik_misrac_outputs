  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_file_write violates the MISRA rule (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) we must know whether the function or any callees mutate the objects pointed to, and whether any casts/uses require non-const pointers. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- lfs_t: the definition of the lfs object is needed to determine whether lfs_file_write (or its callees) modify any data through the lfs pointer (fields read/written such as cfg or mlist). If lfs is only accessed read-only, its parameter could be const; if fields are modified it cannot.\n\n- lfs_file_t: the concrete type/structure of file is required to see whether lfs_file_write or its callees modify the file object. If file is not modified, the parameter could be const; if it is modified, it must remain non-const.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: the code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*) and passes it to lfs_mlist_isopen. The definition shows whether that view of the object is const-eligible and whether the cast discards const-qualification. It also clarifies which fields are accessed.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration): the prototype (parameter types and const qualifiers) is required to see whether it expects a non-const struct lfs_mlist* (forcing file to be non-const) or could accept a const pointer. Its signature determines whether the call forces a non-const parameter or whether the cast in the assert is removing const.\n\n- lfs_file_write_ (declaration + implementation): lfs_file_write simply forwards to lfs_file_write_. We must inspect the declaration (parameter const-qualification) and the implementation to see whether the function modifies the file or lfs objects or the buffer. If lfs_file_write_ mutates file or lfs, lfs_file_write cannot make those parameters const.\n\n- lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite (declarations/implementations): these are callees of lfs_file_write_. If lfs_file_write_ delegates modifications to these functions, we must inspect them to determine whether they modify the file or lfs state, thus preventing const qualification of the pointers in the public wrapper.\n\n(Other macros used in the wrapper such as LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE/LFS_ASSERT do not affect pointer constness analysis and are not required to decide this MISRA rule for this function.)"
