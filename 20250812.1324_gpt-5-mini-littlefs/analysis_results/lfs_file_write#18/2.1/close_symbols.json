  "explanation": "You must inspect any symbol that can affect control flow or deterministically prevent execution of later statements to decide if code in lfs_file_write is unreachable. Explanations:\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is evaluated first and its return determines whether the function returns immediately. Its definition/semantics are required to know whether the \"if (err) return err;\" branch can always be taken or whether LFS_LOCK could be non-returning (e.g. abort/longjmp), which would make following code unreachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Unlock occurs just before return; its definition is needed to ensure it does not change control flow (e.g. non-returning, longjmp, abort) or implicitly make subsequent code unreachable.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros/functions can call non-returning handlers or change control flow in some build configurations; inspect its definition to rule out unconditional aborts/returns that would make later statements unreachable.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertions often abort or trap on failure. Its implementation (and whether it is compiled out) determines whether the assertion can cause non-returning behavior, making following code unreachable in some builds.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although used inside LFS_ASSERT here, its behavior may influence whether the assertion triggers (and thus whether following code may become unreachable via abort). Also knowing whether it has side effects that affect control flow is necessary.\n- lfs_file_write_: The called function may be non-returning (infinite loop, abort, longjmp) or may otherwise affect reachability of the code after its call (the trailing trace, unlock, and return). Its implementation is needed to determine if the statements after the call are reachable.\n- lfs_t (type/definition): Needed to understand the cfg member passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and any macros that inspect fields of lfs_t that could affect control flow (the macros may access cfg internals).\n- lfs_file_t (type/definition): Needed for completeness to understand any macro expansions or implicit conversions used in assertions/traces that could influence control flow.\n\nCollecting these definitions allows a determinate analysis of whether any statement in lfs_file_write is guaranteed never to execute (violating MISRA C unreachable code rule) across build configurations."
