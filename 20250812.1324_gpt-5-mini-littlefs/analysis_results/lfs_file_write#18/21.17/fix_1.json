  "explanation": "The original code was truncated mid-string which produced a missing terminating quote and left the function incomplete. I closed the logging string, added the remaining lines to log the return value, call LFS_UNLOCK, handle any unlock error, and return the result. No original logic was removed; only the missing tail of lfs_file_write was restored so the code compiles."
