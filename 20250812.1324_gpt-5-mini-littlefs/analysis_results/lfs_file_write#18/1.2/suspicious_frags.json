  "explanation": "I have reported constructs that can be compiler-/language-standard dependent and therefore should be checked against the target compiler documentation and project language mode: compound literal (&(uint8_t){0}), variadic macro definition/usage (LFS_TRACE with __VA_ARGS__), the use of printf format macros from <inttypes.h> (PRIu32/PRId32), C99 fixed-width integer typedefs (int32_t/uint32_t), and the use of single-line // comments. These are legitimate C language features in C99 and later, but they are sometimes documented by compilers as extensions when compiling in older language modes (C89/ANSI C) \u2014 so they merit investigation under MISRA Rule 1.2 for the given toolchain and build settings. All other code fragments were not flagged because they use standard, non\u2011compiler\u2011specific C constructs: function definitions and returns, ordinary casts (e.g. (void*)), the comma operator in macros (e.g. ((void)cfg,0)), nested/embedded struct declarations, use of assert via a macro, simple macro-based locking stubs, and adjacent string literal concatenation \u2014 none of these are compiler extensions per se and therefore do not require investigation for Rule 1.2."
