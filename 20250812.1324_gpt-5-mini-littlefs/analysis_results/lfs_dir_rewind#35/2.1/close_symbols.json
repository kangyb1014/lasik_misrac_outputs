  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_dir_rewind contains unreachable code we must know whether any invoked macro or function can cause control to not return (e.g. an early return, longjmp, exit or a macro that expands to a return/goto). Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: its definition may expand to a function call, a user callback, or even contain control-flow constructs that prevent reaching subsequent statements; we must know its expansion and return behaviour.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: similar to LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation/expansion could affect reachability (e.g. if it never returns or longjmps).\n- LFS_TRACE: often a macro that can be empty or expand to logging code; if it expands to control-flow altering code (unlikely but possible) it could create unreachable code elsewhere \u2014 include its definition to be certain.\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: the target calls this function; to know whether statements after the call (LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return err) are reachable we must inspect lfs_dir_rewind_ implementation (it may exit, longjmp, abort, or otherwise not return).\n- lfs_dir_fetch: lfs_dir_rewind_ calls this; lfs_dir_rewind_\u2019s ability to return normally may depend on its callees, so include transitive callee(s) to fully determine reachability.\n- struct lfs_t: the type and in particular the cfg member are needed because macros/functions (LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK) take lfs->cfg; the structure layout and types determine which callbacks are invoked and their prototypes.\n- cfg struct (e.g. lfs_config) and its lock/unlock callback prototypes/attributes: if the callbacks are declared with attributes (noreturn) or are user-supplied functions that may not return, they make code after the call unreachable \u2014 their declarations and attributes are required for a correct MISRA unreachable-code analysis.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions/implementations and callback prototypes) lets the analyzer determine whether any of the invoked macros/functions/callbacks prevent control reaching the later statements, and therefore whether unreachable code exists."
