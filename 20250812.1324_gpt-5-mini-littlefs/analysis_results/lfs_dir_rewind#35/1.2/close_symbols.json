  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are written as macros or functions in the call site. If they are macros they expand into code inside the target function; their definitions must be inspected for language extensions (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__ annotations, GCC statement expressions, or other compiler-specific constructs). Even if they are functions, their declarations could use compiler-specific attributes or extensions.\\n- LFS_TRACE: this is almost certainly a macro (variadic) that expands into tracing/printing code. Variadic macros, format-attribute annotations, or other macro internals may use compiler extensions. You must see its definition to determine whether the target function uses any language extensions via this macro expansion.\\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: although called as a normal function, its definition could be a macro, a static/extern inline with compiler-specific inline semantics, or contain extension usage that effectively appears inlined into the target. Examine its definition to rule out extensions affecting the call.\\n- lfs_t and lfs_dir_t: the types of the function parameters may themselves be defined using compiler extensions (packed attributes, flexible array/bit-field extensions, compiler-specific type attributes). Their full type definitions are needed to check for any language-extension usage visible in the target function signature or member access.\\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration object): the target reads lfs->cfg and passes it to LFS_LOCK; the cfg object's type and its declaration may use extensions (typedefs to compiler-specific types, attributes, or macros). You must inspect that type and its declaration to determine whether the target function (via member access or passing cfg) relies on language extensions."
