  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (they should point to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified). The line LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); is a use-site, not a declaration. Without the declaration of lfs->cfg or the prototype/definition of LFS_UNLOCK, there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 breach. A specific violation scenario would be: lfs->cfg is declared as a pointer to a non-const type (e.g. cfg_t *cfg) but neither the code nor LFS_UNLOCK modifies the pointed object \u2014 in that case cfg should be declared as const cfg_t * and Rule 8.13 would be violated."
