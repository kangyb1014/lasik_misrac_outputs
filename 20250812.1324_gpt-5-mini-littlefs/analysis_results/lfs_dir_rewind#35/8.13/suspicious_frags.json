  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Specifically: - The if (err) { return err; } statement and the final return err; involve an integer status, not pointer type qualifiers. - The second trace call LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_rewind -> %d\", err); only prints an integer and does not involve pointer parameter declarations or pointer-to-object qualifiers. - The local variable 'err' is a plain int, not a pointer, so it is not relevant to const-qualified pointer concerns. Therefore only the listed fragments, which declare or pass pointer-typed objects (function parameters, casts, and macro calls that accept fields from the lfs pointer), need further investigation for possible const qualification."
