  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol:\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called directly by lfs_file_seek; must be inspected for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_file_seek_: the primary internal implementation invoked by lfs_file_seek; any memcmp usage in this function would make the public wrapper violate the rule.\n- lfs_file_size_: called by lfs_file_seek_; inspect for memcmp usage (directly or via helpers) that might compare C-strings.\n- lfs_ctz_index: called by lfs_file_seek_; may contain byte/string comparisons using memcmp that need checking.\n- lfs_file_flush: called by lfs_file_seek_; could invoke code that uses memcmp on strings.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: macros or functions used by lfs_file_seek for locking; macros can expand to code that might call memcmp or string-comparison helpers, so inspect their definitions.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging/trace macro used in lfs_file_seek; tracing helpers sometimes format or compare strings\u2014inspect for memcmp usage.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro used in lfs_file_seek; its expansion may perform checks that use memcmp. \n\nThese symbols cover all direct callees and reachable callees from lfs_file_seek plus macros used in its body; inspecting their implementations is necessary to determine whether memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings anywhere in the call chain of the target function."
