  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for language-extension use:\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or inline functions) used for locking. Their definitions must be inspected to detect compiler extensions (e.g. inline assembly, __attribute__, __builtin_* or compiler-specific synchronization intrinsics).\n- LFS_TRACE: A logging/trace macro. It may use variadic macros, token-pasting (##__VA_ARGS__), stringizing, or compiler-specific builtins/attributes. The macro body must be inspected for any non-standard (compiler-specific) constructs.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro may expand to compiler-specific constructs (e.g. __builtin_unreachable, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or attributes). Its definition is needed to determine if an extension is used.\n- PRId32: Format macro used inside a string literal (\"%\"PRId32). PRId32 is normally from <inttypes.h>, but it could be redefined or implemented using non-standard tricks. Check its definition to ensure it isn't a compiler-specific extension.\n- struct lfs_mlist: The code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*). The struct definition (or its typedef) must be checked for any use of compiler extensions in its declaration (packed attributes, bit-field extensions, anonymous struct/union extensions, etc.).\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although a simple callee, its prototype/definition may use compiler extensions (attributes, non-standard calling conventions). Verify its declaration/definition to ensure no extensions are introduced that affect the call in this function.\n- lfs_file_seek_: The internal worker function called here may have a prototype or attributes (e.g. section attributes, calling convention attributes) that are compiler-specific. Its declaration/definition must be checked to ensure no language extensions are used that would affect calls/return types.\n- lfs_soff_t, lfs_t, lfs_file_t: These typedefs/types are used in the function signature and dereferencing (lfs->cfg, lfs->mlist). Their definitions must be inspected for use of compiler-specific extensions (e.g. non-standard integer-width typedefs, attribute annotations, anonymous members, or GCC/clang extensions).\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions of all macros used in the body (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_ASSERT), the format macro (PRId32), the involved types (lfs_soff_t, lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist), and the callee declarations (lfs_mlist_isopen, lfs_file_seek_) to determine whether any compiler/implementation-specific language extensions are used."
