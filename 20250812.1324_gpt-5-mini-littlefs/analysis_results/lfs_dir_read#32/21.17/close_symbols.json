This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Brief justification for each symbol:\n- lfs_dir_read_: This callee implements the real work of lfs_dir_read. Any string.h calls (memcpy/strncpy/etc.) and their argument relationships will be in its body, so its source is required to check bounds.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Called (transitively) by lfs_dir_read_. It may read raw directory entries into buffers and use memcpy/memmove; you must inspect it to find any <string.h> usage and the source/destination buffer sizes.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Also called (transitively) and likely responsible for filling struct lfs_info (e.g., copying file names). You need its code to see how it copies strings and whether it respects destination lengths.\n- struct lfs_info: The layout and sizes of fields (for example a char name[] member and its declared size) are necessary to determine whether any string copy/write in the callees can overflow the destination.\n- lfs_dir_t: The directory handle structure may contain pointers/buffers/lengths used by the callees; its definition is required to reason about buffer bounds used in copies.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem state structure is needed to resolve lfs->cfg and any buffers or limits derived from the filesystem instance that affect copy lengths.\n- struct lfs_config (lfs->cfg): The configuration structure (or its typedef) holds parameters (e.g., name length limits, block sizes) that influence allowable copy sizes. Callees may use config fields rather than hardcoded constants.\n- LFS_NAME_MAX (or cfg->name_max): Any compile-time or config-defined constants that specify maximum name/buffer sizes are needed to check whether copy lengths are bounded correctly.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Although these are lock macros/functions, include them to ensure they do not perform any buffer manipulation or alter cfg/handles in ways that affect subsequent string operations.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/format macros can call formatting or string functions; include its definition to verify it does not use any offending string.h functions on user-supplied buffers.\n\nIn short: to decide if lfs_dir_read violates the MISRA <string.h> bounds rule you must inspect lfs_dir_read_ and its callees that perform actual copying, plus the data-structure and configuration symbols that determine destination buffer sizes and any helper macros that might perform string operations."
