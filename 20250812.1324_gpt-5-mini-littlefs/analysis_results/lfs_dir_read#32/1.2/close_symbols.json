  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions it relies on, because extensions are commonly hidden in macros, type declarations, or callee declarations:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: this is a macro (or inline helper) used directly in the function. Macro bodies often use compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, __builtin_* calls, nested function syntax, etc.). Inspecting its definition is required to detect any such extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the expansion may contain compiler-specific constructs.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing macros frequently use variadic macros, format helpers, or compiler-specific builtins/attributes. Its definition must be checked for extensions (variadic macros are standard in C99 but some implementations add extensions; other constructs may be present).\n- lfs_dir_read_ (declaration/definition): the called function\u2019s prototype/definition may carry compiler-specific function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))), inline asm, or use nonstandard parameter declarations; the body may also use extensions that affect correctness of calling code.\n- lfs_t (type definition, including its cfg member/type): the function accesses lfs->cfg. The type definition may use compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, bit-field uses, flexible-array/zero-length arrays implemented as extension, or other nonstandard features) that must be examined to decide if the code uses language extensions.\n- lfs_dir_t (type definition): include to check for nonstandard type declarations (anonymous members, attributes, etc.) used by the function\u2019s parameters.\n- struct lfs_info (definition): the callee receives a pointer to this structure; its definition may include compiler extensions that the function depends on.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macro definitions and the full declarations/definitions of the called function and the involved types) is sufficient to decide if the target function itself or its immediate dependencies use any documented compiler language extensions."
