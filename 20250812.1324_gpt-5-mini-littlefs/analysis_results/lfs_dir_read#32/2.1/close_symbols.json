  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: must see its definition/expansion and return/side\u2011effect behavior (is it a normal function returning int, a macro that can longjmp/exit, or always returns a constant). If it never returns or always returns a fixed value then portions of lfs_dir_read may be unreachable.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: its definition is needed to determine whether calling it is reachable or if it expands to something that might be non\u2011returning or conditionally compiled away (affects reachability of the trailing code).\\n- LFS_TRACE: this macro/function may expand to nothing or to code that can affect control flow (e.g. assertions that abort). Knowing its expansion is necessary to rule out hidden non\u2011returning behavior that would make following statements unreachable.\\n- lfs_dir_read_: the body/definition is required to know whether it returns normally or can transfer control non\u2011locally (longjmp/exit) or never return; if it never returns then the subsequent LFS_TRACE/LFS_UNLOCK/return sequence could be unreachable.\\n- lfs_dir_fetch and lfs_dir_getinfo: these are callees of lfs_dir_read_. If lfs_dir_read_ delegates to them, their behaviors (especially non\u2011returning behavior or unconditional aborts/exits) can cause lfs_dir_read_ to be non\u2011returning and thus make code in lfs_dir_read unreachable.\\n- struct lfs_t (and the type of lfs->cfg): needed because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg \u2014 the cfg type or its semantics could affect the locking macros (e.g. compile\u2011time conditional behavior) and whether lfs_dir_read\u2019s early return path vs. unlock path is reachable.\\n- struct lfs_dir_t and struct lfs_info: include their definitions to ensure there are no hidden semantics (e.g. intrinsics/overloaded macros) tied to those types that could affect control flow during calls.\\n\nThese symbols let an analyzer determine whether any statement in lfs_dir_read is impossible to reach under all legal builds/expansions (MISRA unreachable\u2011code concern), by exposing all potential non\u2011local transfers or conditional compilation that could make code dead."
