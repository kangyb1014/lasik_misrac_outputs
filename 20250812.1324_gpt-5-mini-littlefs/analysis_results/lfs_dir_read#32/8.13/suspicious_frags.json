  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not declare or pass pointer types that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. Specifically:\n- The LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) calls operate on lfs->cfg (locking mechanism) and do not introduce additional pointer-typed API that should be const-qualified here.\n- The trace of the return value (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_read -> %d\", err)) and the local variable err are unrelated to pointer const-qualification.\n- The struct lfs_info definition contains an internal char array (name) and scalar fields (type, size), not pointer members that would require const qualification.\nThese items therefore do not need further investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
