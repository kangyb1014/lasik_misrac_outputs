  "explanation": "To decide whether the parameter lfs (type lfs_t *) in lfs_mkdir should be const-qualified, we must know whether lfs_mkdir or anything it calls modifies the object pointed to by lfs. lfs_mkdir itself immediately calls lfs_mkdir_, so the implementation and the prototypes/declarations of lfs_mkdir_ and all functions it calls are required to determine whether any of them write to the filesystem state (and therefore require a non-const lfs pointer). Specifically: \n\n- lfs_mkdir_: the body determines whether lfs is read-only or mutated; its parameter type and use determine const-qualification of the outer API.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_dir_find, lfs_path_islast, lfs_path_namelen, lfs_alloc_ckpoint, lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_pair_tole32, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_pair_fromle32, lfs_fs_preporphans: these are transitive callees of lfs_mkdir_. Any of them may accept a (non-)const lfs_t * or may mutate fields reachable from lfs. Their prototypes and/or implementations are needed to see whether they mutate filesystem state or could accept const.\n- \"prototype/declaration of each of the above functions\": useful to check whether they declare lfs parameters as const or non-const (MISRA focuses on declared pointer types where possible).\n- definition of lfs_t (type/struct): needed to know which fields are mutable, the exact type of cfg, and whether lfs is effectively immutable in the API.\n- definition of the type of lfs->cfg (the configuration struct/typedef): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; their definitions and cfg type tell whether locking APIs or cfg access require non-const pointers (i.e., mutate state).\n- definition of LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros: these may expand to code that modifies data reachable from lfs->cfg or require non-const pointers; that affects whether lfs (or its cfg field) can be const.\n- definition of LFS_TRACE macro/function: typically non-mutating, but include to confirm it does not modify lfs or its contents.\n\nCollecting the above symbols (implementations and prototypes) lets the next analyser determine whether any writes or non-const parameter requirements exist that would prevent qualifying lfs as const under the MISRA rule."
