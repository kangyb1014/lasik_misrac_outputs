According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, these parameters should be const-qualified (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node). The explicit cast (struct lfs_mlist*)node in the comparison also masks const-correctness. A simple fix is to iterate with a const pointer (for (const struct lfs_mlist *p = head; p; p = p->next) ...) and make both parameters const.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/139.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    fflush(f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint lfs_file_truncate(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, lfs_off_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        probe_log(\"lfs_file_truncate: LFS_LOCK failed: err=%d, lfs=%p, file=%p, size=%\" PRIu32, err, (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_truncate(%p, %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n\n    /*\n     * Probe: record the exact pointers and the explicit cast used in the\n     * original assertion.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is plausible but cannot be confirmed from the provided snippet alone. Rule 8.13 requires pointer parameters to point to const-qualified types whenever they are only inspected. If lfs_mlist_isopen\u2019s prototype/implementation indeed only examines (does not modify) the list elements, then that function\u2019s parameters should be declared as const (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node) and the explicit cast in lfs_file_truncate would be masking a failure to use const-correct types \u2014 in that case the report is correct. However, the code shown here is only lfs_file_truncate; it does not include the declaration or implementation of lfs_mlist_isopen. Without that declaration/implementation you cannot determine whether the function modifies its arguments or whether its parameters are already const. Also note that lfs_file_truncate itself cannot be made const for file because it calls lfs_file_truncate_ (which presumably modifies file), so any complaint about constness should be directed at lfs_mlist_isopen\u2019s signature, not at lfs_file_truncate. Recommendation: inspect the prototype/definition of lfs_mlist_isopen. If it does not modify the pointees, change its parameters to const-qualified pointer types and remove casts that discard qualifiers."
