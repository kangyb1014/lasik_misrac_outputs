  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension usage in the target function:\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or inline functions) invoked directly in the function. Their expansions must be inspected for compiler-specific extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, asm, non-standard builtins) or use of non-standard keywords.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro expands into code inside the function (likely variadic macro or function-like macro). Its expansion may contain language extensions (variadic macro extensions, GCC attributes, __FILE__/__func__ usage if implemented non-portably). Must inspect definition.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros often hide compiler-specific constructs (do/while(0) is OK, but may use __builtin_expect, __attribute__, or other extensions). Need definition to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- PRIu32: This format macro comes from inttypes.h or a project redefinition. Confirming its origin/definition is necessary to ensure it is a standard C macro and not a project/compiler-specific extension.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, lfs_off_t: The underlying typedefs/structs may use compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-field types with implementation-defined widths, or compiler-specific storage-class specifiers). Their definitions must be checked for non-standard language use.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (definition): The function is used inside LFS_ASSERT; it could be a macro or inline that uses extensions. Inspecting its definition ensures no extension is introduced through this call.\n\n- lfs_file_truncate_ (definition): The function called by lfs_file_truncate could be a macro, inline, or contain language extensions itself; its definition must be checked because its code is effectively part of the functional behavior and may introduce extensions affecting the caller (e.g. inlined statement-expressions or attributes).\n\n(Reasoning: MISRA\u2019s prohibition of language extensions applies to constructs introduced via macros, typedefs, inline functions, or any included code. To determine whether the target function violates the rule you must examine all macro expansions and the definitions of any types or callees that could bring in non-standard constructs.)"
