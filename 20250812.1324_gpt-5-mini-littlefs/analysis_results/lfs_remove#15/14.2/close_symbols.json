The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n- lfs_remove_: The immediate callee. Any for-loops violating the MISRA rule will be inside this function; its full body must be inspected.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_dir_get, lfs_pair_fromle32, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_fs_preporphans, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_gstate_hasorphans, lfs_fs_pred, lfs_dir_drop: All direct callees of lfs_remove_. A for-loop's body behavior includes called functions; these functions must be examined because (a) they may themselves contain for-loops that must be checked for the three clauses and single loop counter rule, and (b) they may modify objects that appear in for-loop header clauses of their callers (which would make those loops non\u2011well\u2011formed under MISRA). Any modification to objects used in the loop condition or increment must be known.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: Macros used in lfs_remove. They are included to be certain they do not introduce for-loops or side-effects that affect loop header variables (e.g., through hidden modifications), or obscure locking/state changes relevant to loop analysis.\n- lfs_t (type) and lfs->cfg (configuration object/type): Type/layout information is needed to determine which objects are being referenced/modified (for example, whether functions modify fields reachable from the loop header), and to understand whether objects used as loop counters/flags are aliases into lfs_t or its cfg. Knowing the types helps decide if an expression in a for header is a valid single loop counter or references objects modified elsewhere.\n\nInclude the source/definitions of the above symbols so the analyzer can (1) find all for loops, (2) check each loop's three clauses against MISRA requirements, and (3) determine whether any called function or macro modifies objects used in the loop headers or increments."
