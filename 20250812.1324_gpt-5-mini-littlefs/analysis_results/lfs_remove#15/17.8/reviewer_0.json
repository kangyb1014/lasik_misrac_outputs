MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters (the pointer object itself), so this is a violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log_path_state(const char *stage, const char * const *pathp) {\n    if (stage == NULL || pathp == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Ensure the directory exists (best-effort).

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the shown lfs_remove implementation. In the code you provided lfs_remove receives const char *path and only passes path (the value) to lfs_remove_: it never takes &path or otherwise writes to the local parameter variable. Therefore lfs_remove itself does not modify the parameter and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8.\n\nTwo clarifications: (1) If some other function were to take the address of a caller's parameter (e.g. passing &path) and write through it, that would indeed constitute modification of a function parameter and would violate Rule 17.8 \u2014 but that would be a fault in the function that performs or enables that write, and you need evidence showing &path is being passed and written. (2) Your test probe did not record anything for lfs_remove (no exercised calls), so it provides no evidence that lfs_remove's parameter is ever modified at runtime.\n\nGiven the provided code and the lack of evidence that &path is passed/written, the agent A report is not correct for the shown lfs_remove implementation."
