  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/function that produces the initial err value. It could expand to control-flow (return/longjmp/abort) or be annotated noreturn; its definition is required to determine whether the early-path or subsequent code in lfs_stat is reachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: macro/function called before returning. If it contains control-flow effects (e.g. longjmp/exit) or is annotated noreturn, it affects reachability of code after the call and overall control flow in lfs_stat.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing macro used twice in lfs_stat. Some builds define tracing macros with side effects (including control-flow or conditionally compiled-out code). Its definition is needed to ensure the trace calls do not make any statements unreachable.\n- lfs_stat_: the function called by lfs_stat. If lfs_stat_ is annotated noreturn or always terminates the program (or unconditionally hangs), the statements following the call in lfs_stat would be unreachable. Full definition (including attributes) is required.\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_dir_getinfo, lfs_tag_id: callees of lfs_stat_. They matter indirectly because lfs_stat_ may call them and they could be annotated noreturn or call abort/longjmp; inspecting them helps decide whether lfs_stat_ can return in all execution paths.\n- lfs_t and struct lfs_config: types for the lfs argument and its cfg member. These are needed to correctly expand/understand LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros (which take lfs->cfg) and to determine whether those macros can perform control-flow that would render subsequent code unreachable."
