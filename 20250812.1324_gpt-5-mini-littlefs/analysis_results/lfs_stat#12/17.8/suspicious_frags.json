  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to, incremented/decremented, or used as an lvalue in this function. Specific checks:\n- int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); \u2014 accesses the object pointed to by lfs (lfs->cfg). Modifying the pointee is allowed by the rule; the pointer variable lfs is not modified.\n- LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_stat(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %p)\", (void*)lfs, path, (void*)info); \u2014 casts and uses the parameters for tracing only; no assignment to the parameters themselves.\n- err = lfs_stat_(lfs, path, info); \u2014 passes the parameters to another function. Passing a pointer parameter does not modify the pointer variable in this scope. (The callee may modify the pointee, which is permitted.)\n- LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_stat -> %d\", err); and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); \u2014 likewise do not reassign any of the function parameters.\nThere are no occurrences of operations that would change the pointer parameters (no assignments like lfs = ..., path = ..., info = ..., nor ++/-- on them). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
