  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_stat (and its callees) can invoke Standard string.h routines in a way that accesses beyond object bounds, the analyzer needs the following symbols/definitions:\n\n- lfs_stat_: The immediate callee. Its implementation determines if and how the input 'path' is parsed and passed to lower-level routines that may call string.h functions (strlen, memcpy, strcpy, memcmp, etc.).\n\n- lfs_dir_find: Likely inspects path components and compares/copies names; its body is a primary place where string operations and buffer copies might occur.\n\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Produces/stores file metadata (possibly writes names into struct lfs_info); need its code to see any string copies into fixed-size buffers.\n\n- lfs_tag_type3 and lfs_tag_id: These tag helper functions are called by lfs_stat_ according to the call graph; they may perform byte/tag parsing that uses memcmp/memcpy or length calculations. Their implementations must be inspected for string.h usage and size checks.\n\n- lfs_t and struct lfs_info: The layout of these types (field types and buffer sizes) is required to determine the sizes of destination objects used in any string operations (e.g. fields that receive names or paths).\n\n- lfs->cfg (cfg type definition): The type of lfs->cfg may contain buffer size constants, configuration flags (e.g. name length limits), or pointers used in copy operations; its definition is needed to understand constraints.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: Although these are locking primitives, their macros/inline bodies should be checked to ensure they do not hide any string operations or side-effects relevant to safety analysis.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: The trace macro/function formats strings and could call string functions (strlen, memcpy, vsnprintf wrappers). Its implementation is needed to ensure the LFS_TRACE calls in lfs_stat do not perform unsafe string operations on 'path' or 'info' pointers.\n\n- LFS_NAME_MAX and LFS_PATH_MAX (or equivalent size constants): Any fixed limits for names/paths are essential to check bounds before copying or computing lengths; these constants are needed to verify correct length checks.\n\n- Directory entry / name buffer structures (e.g. lfs_entry, on-disk name buffers): If any lower-level code copies names from on-disk structures into RAM buffers, you must know the source/destination buffer sizes and layouts to detect possible overruns.\n\n- Any project-specific wrappers around string.h functions: Some codebases wrap memcpy/strncmp/strncpy/etc. with project helpers. Those wrappers must be inspected to see whether they enforce bounds checks or call the raw Standard Library functions in a way that could violate the MISRA rule.\n\nIn short: inspect lfs_stat_ and all functions and types it uses (and the config/macros/constants they reference). Those definitions determine whether any use of standard string.h routines can access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects."
