Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_stat (or any functions it invokes) violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule you must examine any for-loops that appear in lfs_stat's dynamic call tree and the objects those loops use. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- lfs_stat_: You must inspect the body of lfs_stat_ (the direct callee) because any for-loops there (or calls from within those loops) are part of lfs_stat's behaviour. The three clauses of every for must be checked in that function.\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_getinfo, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_tag_id: These are the functions that lfs_stat_ calls (per the static graph). Any for-loops inside these functions (or their callees) must be inspected; further, these functions may be called inside for-loop bodies in lfs_stat_ so their effects on loop counters/flags must be known.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: These macros or inline functions are invoked by lfs_stat. Macros can expand into statements (including loops or modifications of objects) that affect whether a for-loop is well-formed. You need their definitions to ensure they do not introduce hidden modifications to loop counters or control flags.\n\n- typedef struct lfs lfs_t and struct lfs_info: The types of the function parameters must be known because loop counters or loop-control flags can be members of these structures; also functions called by lfs_stat_ may read/modify fields of these structs. Knowing their definitions is necessary to determine whether objects used in for clauses are modified in the loop body (prohibited by the rule).\n\n- all static/global variables referenced by lfs_stat_ and its callees: The rule forbids using objects in the loop-clause that are modified in the loop body; some loop counters or control flags might be globals or statics. You must identify and inspect all such variables used by these functions.\n\n- all transitive callees (source) of lfs_stat_: The MISRA text states that the behaviour of the for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. To be conservative and complete you must obtain the source (or at least full definitions) of every function transitively called from lfs_stat_ so you can detect any modifications to loop counters/flags or illicit side effects inside for-loop bodies.\n\nIn short: obtain the function bodies (lfs_stat_ and its transitive callees), macro definitions invoked by lfs_stat, the relevant struct/type definitions, and any global/static objects those functions use. With those symbols you can identify all for-loops, verify each clause for permitted side-effects and counters, and determine if the MISRA rule is violated."
