  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) we must know whether any pointer parameters or uses in lfs_file_read could, in fact, be const. The following symbols are required:\n\n- lfs_file_read_: need the prototype/definition to see the exact parameter types and const-qualifiers used by the internal reader (whether it mutates the buffer, file object, or lfs object). If lfs_file_read_ writes into buffer or updates file state, buffer/file/lfs cannot be const.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: is called (indirectly) by lfs_file_read_. Its definition shows whether it mutates the file or filesystem state (preventing const qualification of file or lfs pointers).\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: is called by lfs_file_read_ to actually perform reads; its signature/implementation reveals whether the buffer is written to (thus must be non-const) and whether it mutates file or lfs.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: its prototype/definition is required because lfs_file_read passes (struct lfs_mlist*)file to it. If lfs_mlist_isopen takes a non-const pointer, that prevents making file const; conversely, if it accepts a const pointer that supports making file const, that matters.\n\n- lfs_file_t: the typedef/struct definition is needed to know whether lfs_file_t is compatible with struct lfs_mlist, and whether any fields are const-qualified or mutable (affects whether file parameter can be const).\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: definition is needed to check constness of operations involving mlist objects and whether casting file to struct lfs_mlist* hides a const mismatch.\n\n- lfs_t: the filesystem object definition is required to see types/qualifiers of fields accessed here (mlist and cfg) and whether lfs is mutated by read operations (if lfs is modified, it cannot be a pointer-to-const).\n\n- type of lfs->cfg: the concrete type of cfg (and its const-qualification) is needed because LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is invoked. If locking requires a mutable cfg pointer or mutates cfg, that prevents making lfs or cfg const.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their macros/prototypes show whether they take (and possibly modify) cfg or other pointers; that affects whether lfs (and its cfg field) can be const-qualified.\n\nThese symbols let the analyzer determine whether any of the pointer parameters (lfs, file, buffer, or internal pointer uses) are actually modified by the call chain or by macros, and therefore whether they could/should be const-qualified without violating behavior."
