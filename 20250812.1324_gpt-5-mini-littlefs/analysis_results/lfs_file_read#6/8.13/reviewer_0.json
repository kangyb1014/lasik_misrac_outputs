According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, these should be const-qualified (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node). The current implementation also uses a pointer-to-pointer (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head) which is unnecessary for read-only traversal and prevents straightforward const-correctness. A compliant fix is to change the prototype to use const pointers and iterate with a const pointer (const struct lfs_mlist *p = head; p != NULL; p = p->next).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_probe_log_entry(const lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/51.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!fp) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(fp, \"[probe] lfs_file_read ENTRY: lfs=%p, file=%p, buffer=%p, size=%llu\\n\",\n            (const void*)lfs, (void*)file, buffer, (unsigned long long)size);\n\n    /* Log the mlist pointer stored in lfs (if available) for evidence */\n    fprintf(fp, \"[probe] lfs->mlist = %p\\n\", (void*)(lfs ? lfs->mlist : NULL));\n\n    /* Call lfs_mlist_isopen and log its return value.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in substance. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointer types shall be const-qualified whenever possible (i.e. when the pointed-to object is not modified). The provided test trace shows lfs_mlist_isopen is invoked with an explicit cast to a non-const pointer ((struct lfs_mlist*)file), and the agent states that lfs_mlist_isopen only reads the list without modifying it. That indicates the function's prototype/implementation uses non-const pointer parameters even though const would be appropriate. The real violation is in the lfs_mlist_isopen declaration/implementation (and the internal use of a pointer-to-pointer for traversal), while the cast in lfs_file_read both documents and masks that mismatch. Changing the lfs_mlist_isopen prototype to take const struct lfs_mlist * (and iterating with a const pointer, not a pointer-to-pointer) would make the code const-correct and comply with Rule 8.13. Therefore the report is correct."
