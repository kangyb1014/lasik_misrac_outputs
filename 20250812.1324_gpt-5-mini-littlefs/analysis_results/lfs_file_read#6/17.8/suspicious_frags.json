  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters themselves (they only access or pass pointer-referenced objects, which is allowed):\n\n- LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) macros only evaluate the cfg expression and do not assign to any parameter.\n- LFS_TRACE(...) is a noop here and does not modify parameters.\n- The temporary local variable res in lfs_file_read and its assignment from lfs_file_read_ do not modify any of the function parameters.\n- The LFS_ASSERT checks (e.g. checking file->flags) only read members of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter; modifying the pointed-to object is permitted by the rule.\n\nThe selected fragments were chosen because they involve taking the address of a parameter (&head), iterating via pointer-to-pointer starting from a parameter, or calling other functions (lfs_file_flush, lfs_file_flushedread) with pointer parameters \u2014 all of which may hide modifications of the parameter variables themselves or make it less obvious whether a parameter is being reassigned and therefore warrant further manual inspection."
