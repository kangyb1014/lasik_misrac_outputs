  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_tell_: The function called by lfs_dir_tell. The body of this callee contains the real directory handling logic and is the most likely place memcmp could be used to compare names/strings. You must inspect its implementation to see any use of memcmp (or other string-comparison functions) and the nature of the operands.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule refers directly to the Standard Library memcmp. You need the memcmp symbol (or its uses/wrappers) to check whether it is invoked and, if so, whether any of its operand pointers refer to null-terminated C-strings (which would violate the rule).\n\n- lfs_dir_t: The directory object type passed into lfs_dir_tell_ may contain name buffers or string fields. Knowing this type lets you determine whether buffers passed to memcmp (inside lfs_dir_tell_ or callees) are null-terminated strings or raw byte arrays.\n\n- lfs_t: The filesystem object type (first argument) may carry buffers or state used in comparisons; lfs_dir_tell_ may access fields of lfs_t that could be compared with memcmp. Inspecting this type clarifies whether comparisons involve NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: The return typedef is needed to interpret return values (error codes vs offsets). If lfs_dir_tell_ returns error codes on failure (e.g., negative values) you must distinguish whether a returned error originates from a memcmp misuse or elsewhere.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions are invoked by lfs_dir_tell and could expand to code that calls other utilities. They should be checked to ensure they do not themselves call memcmp or otherwise perform string comparisons that would trigger the MISRA rule.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging/trace macros sometimes format or compare strings; verify that LFS_TRACE does not call memcmp or perform unsafe string comparisons.\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration type): The cfg object type accessed via lfs->cfg is the argument to the lock/unlock macros. Its definition may contain function pointers or fields that the lock/unlock macros call; inspect it to ensure no indirect memcmp usage arises through configuration callbacks.\n\nIn short: you must inspect the callee lfs_dir_tell_ and any symbols/macros it (or the wrapper) uses to determine whether memcmp is used and whether any of the memcmp operands are null-terminated strings. The listed types/macros are the minimal set needed to determine the nature of operands and any indirect memcmp usage."
