The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_tell:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_dir_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_dir_tell_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_tell:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_dir_tell_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    (void)lfs;\n    return dir->pos;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The LFS_LOCK macro is defined as ((void)cfg,0), so err is always 0. Therefore the 'if (err) { return err; }' branch is never taken (unreachable) with the provided configuration. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour; note 2 explicitly states that unreachable code is not dead code. Given the provided definitions the fragment is unreachable (not executed) and thus does not violate Rule 2.2. If LFS_LOCK were to return a non\u2011zero error in other builds/configurations, the branch would be required and its removal would affect behaviour."
