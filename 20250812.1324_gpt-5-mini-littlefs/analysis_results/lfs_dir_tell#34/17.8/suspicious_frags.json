  "explanation": "I reviewed all occurrences of the function parameters lfs and dir in the provided code. There are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like lfs = ... or dir = ...), and no operations that reassign these pointers. Specific notes:\n- lfs_dir_tell: parameters are only used to access members (lfs->cfg) and passed to LFS_TRACE and lfs_dir_tell_ \u2014 passing a pointer or using its members does not modify the pointer itself.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros expand to expressions that only reference cfg but do not modify the lfs pointer or the pointed-to object.\n- LFS_TRACE is empty and the casts (void*)lfs, (void*)dir do not modify the pointers.\n- lfs_dir_tell_: contains (void)lfs; (unused-parameter suppression) and returns dir->pos (reads the object pointed to). Reading or modifying the pointee is permitted by Rule 17.8; here only a read occurs.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments that modify function parameter variables and no fragments needing further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
