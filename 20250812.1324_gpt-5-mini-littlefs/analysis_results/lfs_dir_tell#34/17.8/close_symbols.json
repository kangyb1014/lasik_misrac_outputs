  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. It may be a macro (or function) that expands to code with side effects; if it is a macro it could (in theory) contain assignments affecting expressions passed as arguments or refer to the caller's parameter identifiers. You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable 'lfs' (or 'dir') indirectly via macro expansion or side effects.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to or otherwise modify the parameter variables passed (through lfs->cfg) via macro expansion or side effects.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Called with (void*)lfs and (void*)dir. Trace macros sometimes expand to complex code; you must verify the macro does not attempt to assign to its argument expressions or use the parameter identifiers in a way that could modify the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_dir_tell_: Although called as a normal function, you must confirm whether it is really a function or a macro. If it is a macro, its expansion could modify the caller's parameter variables. If it is a function, changes to the callee's local copies of pointer parameters do not violate the MISRA rule for the caller; still include the declaration/definition to be certain.\n\n- lfs_t (full definition; include member 'cfg'): The code uses lfs->cfg. You need the struct/typedef to confirm that 'lfs' is indeed a pointer parameter (and not some macro/alias) and to examine the type of the cfg member passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK. This helps determine whether any expression used could allow modification of the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (typedef/definition): Include the definition to confirm that the 'dir' parameter is a pointer variable (and to confirm there are no surprising macro/typedef behaviors). Also useful to check whether any casts or macro uses could cause an assignment to the parameter variable.\n\n- lfs_soff_t (typedef/definition): The return type. While not directly related to modifying parameters, include it to verify whether returning 'err' (an int) is type-compatible and whether any implicit conversions or macros tied to this typedef might involve unusual side effects. It also helps confirm that 'res' and the return use do not involve hidden modifications of parameters.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions of the macros (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE), confirm whether lfs_dir_tell_ is a function or macro, and have the type definitions for lfs_t, lfs_dir_t, and lfs_soff_t to ensure no hidden macro/typedef tricks can cause assignment to the function parameter variables 'lfs' or 'dir'."
