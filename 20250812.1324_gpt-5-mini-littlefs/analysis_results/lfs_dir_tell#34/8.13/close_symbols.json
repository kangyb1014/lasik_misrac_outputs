  "explanation": "lfs_dir_tell_: need the prototype and implementation to see whether it mutates lfs or dir (if it modifies pointed-to data then the pointers cannot be const). lfs_t (struct/typedef): to know the exact type of the first parameter and whether any of its members (or methods called on it) require mutation; also to find the type/name of the cfg member. lfs_dir_t (struct/typedef): to determine whether directory state is modified by this API (fields that must be written) so we can tell if dir could be const. lfs_soff_t (typedef): included to fully understand the return type (not a pointer but useful for completeness). type of lfs->cfg (the cfg typedef/struct used in lfs_t): required because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are passed lfs->cfg; the cfg type/signature may force non-const (or accept const) which affects whether lfs->cfg could be const-qualified. LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function signatures): their parameter types determine whether passing lfs->cfg requires a non-const pointer (prevents const-qualification of cfg) or could accept const. LFS_TRACE (macro definition): it casts pointers to void* in the call site; the macro definition and its parameter types are needed to check whether any cast in the trace call discards const-qualification (possible MISRA violation)."
