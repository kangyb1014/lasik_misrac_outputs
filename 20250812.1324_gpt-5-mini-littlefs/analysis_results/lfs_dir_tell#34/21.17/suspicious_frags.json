  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided snippets use any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The functions/macros shown are:\n- lfs_dir_tell: calls LFS_LOCK, LFS_TRACE, lfs_dir_tell_, LFS_UNLOCK and returns the result \u2014 none are string functions.\n- lfs_dir_tell_: casts away an unused parameter and returns dir->pos; this is a simple member access, not a string operation.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE macros: their definitions do not call any string handling functions (LFS_TRACE is empty here; LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK only use (void)cfg and integer/void expressions).\n\nBecause no string.h APIs are invoked and there are no calls that pass pointers/buffers to such functions in the provided code, there is nothing that needs investigation under Rule 21.17 in these snippets. If other parts of the codebase (not provided) call string.h functions, those call sites should be inspected for buffer bounds, but no such call sites exist in the given code."
