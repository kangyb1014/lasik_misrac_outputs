  "explanation": "I inspected all code in the target function and the related definitions. I did not find any compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions. Specific items reviewed and why they are not flagged:\n\n- Use of PRId32 in the format string (\"lfs_dir_tell -> %\"PRId32): PRId32 is the standard macro from <inttypes.h> for formatting int32_t and the adjacent string literal concatenation is standard C; not a compiler extension.\n- Use of int32_t and typedef int32_t lfs_soff_t: standard fixed-width integer types from C99 (<stdint.h>); not an extension.\n- Variadic macro LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__): variadic macros are part of standard C99; the macro is defined to expand to nothing here and is not an extension.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros using the comma operator and (void) cast: both are standard C constructs (comma operator, cast to void to suppress unused-variable warnings); not extensions.\n- Casting to (void*) in the LFS_TRACE call and (void)lfs in lfs_dir_tell_: standard C casts and idiom to silence unused-parameter warnings.\n- Inline struct definitions and nested struct types used in lfs_t and lfs_dir_t: standard C struct declarations, not compiler extensions.\n- No occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GNU statement expressions ({...}), __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, nested functions, inline assembly, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n\nBecause none of the constructs above are compiler-specific extensions, there are no suspicious fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (Language extensions should not be used). If you want, I can re-check against a specific compiler's documented extensions if you provide the compiler name/version and its extension list."
