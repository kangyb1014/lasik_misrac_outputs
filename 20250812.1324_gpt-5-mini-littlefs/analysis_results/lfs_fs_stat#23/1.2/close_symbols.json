  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_stat uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the expansions and definitions of every macro, type and called function that appear in the function body (macros can hide extensions).  Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it may use GCC/clang extensions (statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __extension__, __attribute__, inline asm, etc.) or compiler-specific builtins. We need the macro definition/expansion to detect any such extensions.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation/definition may contain language extensions (macros, attributes, asm, statement expressions). Inspecting it is required to conclude no extensions are used.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro could be a variadic macro, wrap statement-expressions, use compiler-specific format attributes (__attribute__((format(...)))), or other extensions. Its definition is required to verify it only uses standard C.\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: The called function's declaration/definition must be checked for compiler-specific function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))), inline asm, or non-standard linkage/extension syntax that might be present in its prototype/definition and therefore used by the caller.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): The function dereferences lfs and casts it to (void*) for tracing. The struct definition may contain anonymous unions/structs, bit-field width specifiers beyond the standard, or attributes on the type or members; these constructs can be compiler extensions and must be inspected.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg member of lfs_t): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg as argument. The cfg type definition may include extensions (e.g. alignment attributes, packed attributes, flexible-array members used non-portably) or the macros may rely on specific member layouts; inspect this type to ensure no extension usage.\n\n- struct lfs_fsinfo (type definition): The second parameter's type may include non-standard constructs (anonymous unions/structs, GCC __attribute__s, bitfields with implementation-only widths, VLAs in struct) or macros associated with it. Its definition is required to rule out extensions.\n\nTogether these definitions/expansions allow a reviewer to expand all macros used in lfs_fs_stat and inspect any attributes, asm, typeof/statement-expression uses, or other compiler-specific extensions that would violate the MISRA rule. Only these symbols are required to analyze whether the target function itself uses language extensions; other callees listed in the static call graph are not necessary unless their declarations introduce attributes used by the caller."
