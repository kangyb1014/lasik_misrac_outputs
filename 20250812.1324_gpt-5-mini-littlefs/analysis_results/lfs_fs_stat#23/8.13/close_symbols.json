  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_stat_: The body of lfs_fs_stat simply forwards its pointers to lfs_fs_stat_; you must inspect lfs_fs_stat_ to see whether it mutates the objects pointed to by its lfs and fsinfo parameters (i.e. whether those pointers must be non-const).\n- lfs_t: The definition of the filesystem context type is required to know what lfs points to and whether its members (and their types) are modified or could be const-qualified.\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: The definition of the fsinfo structure is required to know which fields might be written by lfs_fs_stat_ or callees; if fsinfo is only read it could be const.\n- lfs->cfg type (definition of the type of the cfg member): lfs_fs_stat calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); the type and semantics of cfg and whether the lock APIs take/modify it determine if lfs->cfg must be mutable, affecting whether lfs can be const.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: Their declarations/macros show the parameter types and whether they modify the pointed-to object; if they accept non-const pointers they prevent making lfs or its cfg member const.\n- LFS_TRACE: Declaration/macro shows how pointers are used (usually cast to void*) and whether it modifies the pointed-to data; if it only reads for logging, it does not prevent const qualification.\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32: These are direct callees (via lfs_fs_stat_). You need their prototypes/definitions to see whether they take pointers to lfs or fsinfo (or subobjects) and whether they modify those pointees; any callee that writes through a pointer prevents that pointer from being const.\n\nCollecting these symbols (function bodies/prototypes and the indicated type definitions/macros) lets the next analyst determine whether the pointers passed into lfs_fs_stat (and the lfs->cfg member) are only read and therefore can be const-qualified per the MISRA guideline, or whether they are written and must remain non-const."
