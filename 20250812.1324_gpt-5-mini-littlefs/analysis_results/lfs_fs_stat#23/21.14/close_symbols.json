  "explanation": "To determine if lfs_fs_stat violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect not only the wrapper but any code it calls (and related types/macros) because memcmp could appear there or be hidden by macros. Explanations:\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: The direct implementation called by lfs_fs_stat; it is the primary place to look for any memcmp usage or string comparisons.\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32: These are the immediate callees of lfs_fs_stat_. Any of them might call memcmp (directly or indirectly) on buffers that are actually null-terminated strings; their bodies/prototypes must be inspected to decide compliance.\n- memcmp: The standard function named in the MISRA rule. You must locate any calls to memcmp (and inspect the arguments) to determine whether those calls compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the rule).\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging/trace macro or function that may perform string operations or call helpers that use memcmp; inspect its definition to ensure it doesn't hide a prohibited memcmp usage.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: Lock/unlock macros or functions used by lfs_fs_stat; inspect their definitions in case they expand to code that uses memcmp or string comparisons.\n- lfs_t, struct lfs_fsinfo: The types of the function parameters. Their field types (pointers vs fixed-length buffers) determine whether data passed to memcmp would be null-terminated strings. You need these type definitions to judge whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings or raw memory blocks.\n\nInspecting the listed symbols (function bodies, macro definitions, and the types) is sufficient to find any memcmp usage reachable from lfs_fs_stat and to determine whether such usage compares null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
