  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required to decide if memcmp is being (mis)used to compare null-terminated strings:\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: direct callee of lfs_file_size; its implementation may call memcmp (or other string compare) to detect open files or compare names \u2014 must be inspected.\n- lfs_file_size_: direct callee that computes the size; may itself call memcmp or call other helpers that do \u2014 need its body.\n- lfs_max: called by lfs_file_size_; include to check whether any downstream code uses memcmp.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: macros or inline helpers used here (locking on lfs->cfg); macros can expand to functions or checks that might use memcmp or string comparison macros \u2014 inspect expansions.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function used in this function; logging helpers sometimes perform string formatting or comparisons; check it does not wrap memcmp calls on C-strings.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro could expand into code that compares strings or calls helper routines \u2014 inspect expansion.\n- struct lfs_mlist, lfs_t, lfs_file_t: the types of the arguments and the mlist cast are needed to determine whether pointers passed (directly or via callees) to memcmp are pointers to null-terminated C-strings (vs. binary buffers), which is essential to decide a MISRA violation.\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function of concern \u2014 search for direct calls (or macro/wrapper aliases) to memcmp in the target and all included symbols above to determine if it is being used to compare null-terminated strings."
