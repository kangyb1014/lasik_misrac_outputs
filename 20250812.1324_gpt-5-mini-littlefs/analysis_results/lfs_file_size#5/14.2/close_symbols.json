The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must examine any function or macro whose body (or macro expansion) might contain for\u2011loops or side effects that affect loop counters/objects, because MISRA's for\u2011loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions/macros as part of the loop body/clauses. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_file_size_: This is called from lfs_file_size and can itself contain for loops or call other routines (it already calls lfs_max). Its implementation must be checked for any for statements that could violate the MISRA requirements.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called inside LFS_ASSERT in the target. Its body could contain for loops or modify objects that would affect conformance; its behaviour is part of the calling context and must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_max: Called by lfs_file_size_. It may be a function or macro; if it contains loops or side effects, that could affect compliance. Check its definition.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro/function invoked at the start. Macros can expand to code containing for loops or modify objects used in loops; its expansion/implementation must be reviewed.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Opposite of LFS_LOCK; check its expansion/implementation for loops or side effects.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function used twice in the target. Its expansion may contain function calls or loops (or modify objects) that count as part of the function body for MISRA analysis; verify it does not introduce problematic for statements or side effects.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro wrapping lfs_mlist_isopen. Macros often expand to code (including control structures); its expansion and the behaviour of the asserted function are relevant to determine if any for statements violate the rule.\n\nNote: The MISRA for\u2011loop rule applies to for statements in the target function and in any functions/macros they call. The symbols above are those reachable directly from lfs_file_size (or via immediate callees) whose definitions could contain for statements or side effects relevant to the rule. Inspect these definitions (and any further callees they contain) for ill-formed for loops."
