  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment as written. The function parameter lfs is declared as lfs_t * (non\u2011const) and is explicitly cast to (void*) for printing; buffer is const void * and passed as-is. Rule 8.13 would be violated if a const\u2011qualified pointer were being passed with its const qualifier removed \u2014 for example, if the function were declared as const lfs_t *lfs and the code did (void*)lfs (casting away const), or if a const pointer were implicitly converted to a non\u2011const pointer for use. Such a cast/discard of const would violate the intent of Rule 8.13."
