  "explanation": "- lfs_setattr_: The target forwards its pointer arguments (especially the const void *buffer) directly to lfs_setattr_. To determine whether the const qualifier is preserved or discarded (a MISRA issue), you need the prototype and/or implementation of lfs_setattr_ to see the parameter types (e.g. const void * vs void *) and any casts that drop const.\n- lfs_commitattr: The static call graph shows lfs_setattr_ calls lfs_commitattr; const may be discarded deeper in the call chain. Inspecting lfs_commitattr signature/definition is needed to see whether the buffer (or other pointers) is eventually taken as a non-const pointer or cast away, which would constitute a violation.\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition): The target takes lfs_t *lfs. To decide whether lfs could have been declared pointer-to-const (or whether any pointer members should be const) you must know what lfs_t contains and whether lfs_setattr (or functions it calls) mutate the structure or its fields (for example lfs->cfg). The etails of lfs_t tell you whether making lfs const is possible/appropriate.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions): lfs_setattr calls these with lfs->cfg. Their prototypes/definitions show whether they expect/modify non-const cfg pointers or perform casts; if they require a non-const cfg pointer, that prevents marking lfs (or its cfg member) as const and is relevant to the MISRA const-pointer analysis.\n\nCollecting these symbols (signatures/definitions) lets the next analyst determine whether any const qualifiers are dropped or could have been applied, and therefore whether the code violates the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
