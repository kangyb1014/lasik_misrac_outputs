  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'buffer' is declared as const void * in lfs_setattr and, assuming lfs_setattr_ is declared to take a const void * (i.e. the const qualifier is preserved), passing buffer does not discard const and therefore complies with Rule 8.13. (If lfs_setattr_ were declared to take a non-const void * parameter, that alternative would violate the rule by discarding the const qualifier.)"
