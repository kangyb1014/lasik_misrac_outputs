  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- In lfs_setattr, the parameters (lfs, path, type, buffer, size) are only read and passed unchanged to lfs_setattr_. There are no assignments to these parameter variables.\n- The macros LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are defined as ((void)cfg,0) and ((void)cfg) respectively, which do not modify the cfg argument or any parameter variable. LFS_TRACE is a no-op.\n- lfs_setattr_ also does not modify any of its parameters: it reads size and lfs->attr_max and then calls lfs_commitattr with the same parameters.\n\nThe only potential modification of objects reachable via pointer parameters would occur inside lfs_commitattr, which is outside the provided code and should be examined separately if required. Based on the supplied code fragments, there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to report."
