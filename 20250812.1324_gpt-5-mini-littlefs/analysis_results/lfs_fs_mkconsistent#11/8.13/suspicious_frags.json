  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they do not present pointer-to-non-const declarations that could trivially be made const or are already const/used as mutable storage: - lfs->cfg is declared as const struct lfs_config *cfg (already const-qualified). - Local non-pointer objects (e.g., lfs_gstate_t delta, lfs_mdir_t root) are values, not pointer declarations. - Calls that supply non-const pointers as out-parameters (e.g., &root passed to fetch/commit) are expected to be modified by those functions, so making those parameters const would be incorrect. - Lock/unlock macros operate on cfg but cfg is already const-qualified. - Function parameters that clearly perform modifications to the filesystem state (e.g., functions taking lfs_t *lfs and calling commit/forceconsistency) are intentionally non-const. The listed fragments are the locations where non-const pointers or pointer-typed members are present and merit investigation to determine whether they could or should point to const-qualified types."
