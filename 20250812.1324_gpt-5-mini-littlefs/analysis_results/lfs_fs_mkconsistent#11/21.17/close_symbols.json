  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: This is the direct callee of the target. Its implementation must be inspected for any uses of string.h functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/strlen/etc.) or buffer writes that could go out-of-bounds.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit: These are the functions called by lfs_fs_mkconsistent_. Any use of string functions or memory operations that manipulate buffers will likely be inside these routines (or their callees). Each must be analyzed to see whether sizes/lengths passed to string.h routines are correct and whether pointer parameters refer to adequately sized objects.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions are used by the target to acquire/release the lock using lfs->cfg. They may expand to code that touches buffers or calls helper routines; include them to ensure no hidden string/memory operations occur in the locking/unlocking path.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros often call snprintf/strncpy or similar to format messages. If LFS_TRACE expands to code that formats into fixed-size buffers, it could violate the rule; include its definition to verify safe usage.\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition): The target and its callees pass around lfs pointers and access fields (e.g., lfs->cfg). To determine whether buffers passed into string functions are large enough you need the concrete layout/types and sizes of fields in lfs_t.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the configuration / lock context): The lock macros and possibly other functions operate on lfs->cfg. Include the definition of this type to inspect any buffers or callbacks stored there that might be passed to string functions (for example, callbacks that copy names, paths, or metadata).\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule concerns calls to standard string functions and whether they can access beyond object bounds. The target itself does not call string functions, so the only places to find potential violations are in its callee implementations, any macros it uses (TRACE, LOCK/UNLOCK), and the concrete types/fields used as arguments to those routines. Include those symbols so the next agent can inspect code, buffer sizes, and all uses of memcpy/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc. to determine compliance."
