  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions of the symbols that the target function directly uses or expands to, because language extensions are most likely introduced via macros or inlined implementations rather than in this small wrapper itself. Specifically:\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these appear as macro-like calls in the wrapper. Their definitions may use compiler extensions (inline asm, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, or non-standard macro tricks). Inspecting them is required to determine whether an extension is used.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macros commonly use variadic macros, token-pasting (##__VA_ARGS__), or compiler builtins/attributes. These constructs can be compiler extensions depending on compiler/version; you must see the actual definition and any helper macros it expands to.\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: the wrapper simply calls this function. If that function uses compiler extensions (attributes, inline asm, statement-expr, typeof, builtins, non-standard declarations), the overall code base invokes those extensions via the call, so its implementation must be checked.\n- lfs_t typedef/struct: the parameter type may be defined with compiler-specific extensions (attribute annotations, packed/aligned pragmas, bit-field extensions, flexible array extension use, or anonymous structs/unions). You need the type definition to check for such uses.\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration struct): the wrapper accesses lfs->cfg and passes it to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. The cfg type definition or any macros that define it might contain compiler extensions (attributes, anonymous members, non-standard initializers). \n- any helper macros/functions expanded/used inside LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE: these subsidiary symbols can hide extensions; include them so the analyzer can follow macro expansion chains and detect extension use.\nCollecting these symbols (and the headers/macros they pull in) lets the next agent detect explicit compiler extensions (names starting with double underscore, GNU/clang-specific attributes or builtins, asm, statement-expressions, typeof, nonstandard macro token-pasting, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
