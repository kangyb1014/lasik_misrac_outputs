  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions of these symbols to determine whether the parameter variable 'lfs' is ever modified (MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified). Rationale for each:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: called as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand into statements that assign to identifiers in the caller or otherwise have side-effects that modify the parameter variable; if it's a function you need its prototype to ensure no macro redefinition is hiding an assignment. Verify it does not assign to 'lfs' (or uses the token 'lfs') and does not expand into code that changes the parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reasoning as LFS_LOCK (called with lfs->cfg); examine its definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: called with (void*)lfs. Trace is frequently a macro; its expansion could reference or assign to the argument expression or to the identifier 'lfs' in the caller scope. Inspect the macro/function definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable.\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: this is the function-like call that receives 'lfs'. Although a normal function cannot change the caller's parameter variable, it could be a macro (or inline expansion) that introduces assignments into the caller scope; check its definition/implementation to confirm it does not assign to the 'lfs' parameter variable in lfs_fs_mkconsistent.\n\n- struct lfs_t (and member cfg type): confirm that the parameter is indeed a pointer type (lfs_t *lfs) and that accessing lfs->cfg is a well-formed expression. Knowing the concrete type of cfg may be necessary to inspect LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expansions (they take cfg) and to ensure there are no unusual typedefs, macros, or operator overloads (in C macros) that could cause unexpected assignments to 'lfs'."
