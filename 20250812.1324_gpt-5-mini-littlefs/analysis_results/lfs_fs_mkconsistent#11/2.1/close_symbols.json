  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The first statement calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and its return value controls an early return. To decide if the early-return path makes any subsequent code unreachable we must know whether LFS_LOCK is a simple function/macro returning an int or if it can perform non\u2011local control flow (longjmp/exit/goto-outside), or change lfs state.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called near the end; if LFS_UNLOCK can perform non\u2011local control flow or has side effects that affect reachability analysis (e.g. longjmp/exit), that can change which code is reachable. Its definition is therefore required.  \n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros sometimes expand to code that can alter control flow (rare, but possible). We must inspect its definition to be sure the tracing calls do not introduce returns/longjmps/etc., which would affect reachability.  \n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: This callee may not return normally (could longjmp/exit/loop) or may unconditionally return in a way that makes code after the call unreachable; its implementation is required to determine reachability of the LFS_TRACE/LFS_UNLOCK/return sequence that follows.  \n- lfs_t (type/definition, including cfg member and its type): The LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros take lfs->cfg; the cfg type and lfs_t definition are needed to resolve how those macros operate and to find the correct macro/function overloads or inline implementations.  \nThese symbols are the control\u2011flow relevant definitions needed to determine whether any statements in lfs_fs_mkconsistent are unreachable under any implementation of the called macros/functions."
