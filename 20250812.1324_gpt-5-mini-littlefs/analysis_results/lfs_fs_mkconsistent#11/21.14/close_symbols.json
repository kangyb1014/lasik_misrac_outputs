  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_mkconsistent (or anything it transitively calls) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect all functions reachable from the target for direct or indirect uses of memcmp or equivalent wrappers. - lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: direct callee of the target; its body may contain memcmp calls or call further functions that do. - lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit: these are the static callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ per the call graph; each must be examined for memcmp (or string comparison) use and for the nature of the arguments passed (whether null-terminated strings are being compared). - memcmp: the standard library function itself (or any local wrapper named the same) must be located to confirm occurrences and to check how it is called (arguments, lengths) \u2014 the MISRA violation concerns the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, so identifying memcmp calls and their operands is essential. (Other symbols such as LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE are not relevant to this MISRA rule and need not be included for the memcmp-specific analysis.)"
