  "explanation": "I completed the truncated function and provided minimal type definitions so the code compiles. I added a placeholder lfs_t and a struct lfs_config containing the fields referenced by the probe. Pointer-valued callbacks are declared as void* to make printing straightforward and portable; numeric sizes use uint32_t and are printed via PRIu32. The probe now opens the log file, prints all referenced fields without dereferencing buffers, and closes the file."
