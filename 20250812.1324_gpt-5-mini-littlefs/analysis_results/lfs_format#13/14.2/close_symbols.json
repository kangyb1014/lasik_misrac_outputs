Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required-symbol explanations (concise):\n\n- lfs_format_: The target function calls lfs_format_. MISRA's for-loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body; any for-loops (or loop-affecting side effects) inside lfs_format_ must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_init, lfs_min, lfs_alloc_ckpoint, lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_superblock_tole32, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_deinit: These are the direct callees of lfs_format_ (from the static call graph). To decide whether the target function (via lfs_format_) violates the for-loop rule you must examine each of these functions for for-loops and for any modifications of objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags. Also check whether these functions call further functions that participate in loop bodies (transitive callees).\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: These macros/functions are invoked directly by the target function. Although there are no explicit for-loops in the target, these macros could contain loops or side effects that affect objects used as loop counters; they must be checked.\n\n- struct lfs_config: The target function reads many fields of cfg (function pointers, sizes, buffers); definitions are needed to determine whether fields are objects that may be used or modified by loops in called code (e.g., buffers, function-pointer targets) and whether any field aliases could affect loop-counter modification rules.\n\n- lfs_t: Type of the filesystem object passed into lfs_format/lfs_format_. Its definition is needed to see whether loops in callees modify or rely on members of lfs_t (potential loop counters or objects modified by loop bodies).\n\nNotes: To be sound you must inspect the implementations of the listed functions and their transitive callees (and any global variables they access). The items above are the minimal symbols to fetch first (direct callees, types, and the macros used in the target) so you can locate all for-statements and verify the three clauses, single loop counter rule, and that no loop body (including called functions) modifies loop counters or uses objects forbidden by MISRA."
