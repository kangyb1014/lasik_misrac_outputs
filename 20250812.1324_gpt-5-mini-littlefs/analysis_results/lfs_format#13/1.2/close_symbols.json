  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for language-extension usage\n\n- struct lfs_config (full definition)\n  - The target function prints many members of cfg and performs casts like (void*)(uintptr_t)cfg->read. To determine whether those casts use any compiler-specific extension (e.g. non\u2011standard pointer-to-integer conversions, attributes on members, or nonstandard member types), you must inspect the full struct and member declarations.\n\n- typedef/struct lfs_t (definition)\n  - The type of the first argument may carry compiler-specific extensions or attributes (e.g. calling convention or storage-class attributes). Inspecting lfs_t ensures the parameter declaration does not use language extensions.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition)\n  - This macro/function is invoked at the start of the function. Its expansion could contain language extensions (GNU statement expressions, typeof, inline assembly, compiler attributes, nonstandard keywords). You must see its definition to decide whether an extension is used in code that becomes part of lfs_format.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition)\n  - Same reason as LFS_LOCK: the unlock construct might expand to or call code that uses compiler-specific extensions; its definition is required for analysis.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition)\n  - LFS_TRACE is used with complex format strings and many arguments. It is commonly a macro (variadic) or wrapper which may use variadic macros (__VA_ARGS__), GCC format attributes, or other extensions. The expansion/definition is needed to determine whether any nonstandard language features are used in the lines that appear in lfs_format.\n\n- lfs_format_ (prototype and/or definition)\n  - The target calls lfs_format_. The declaration/definition may contain compiler-specific function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...)), calling-convention specifiers) or other extensions that affect whether the call site or surrounding code uses extensions. Also the function body (if inlined via macros/attributes) could introduce extensions into the compiled lfs_format code.\n\n- Definitions of cfg->read, cfg->prog, cfg->erase, cfg->sync member types (function-pointer types)\n  - These member types determine whether the casts performed in the trace ((void*)(uintptr_t)cfg->read) are well-formed under standard C or rely on implementation-defined/extension behaviour. If these members carry attributes or are nonstandard types, that matters for MISRA analysis.\n\n- uintptr_t (definition / stdint.h) and PRIu32/PRId32 macros (inttypes.h)\n  - The code uses uintptr_t and the inttypes format macros PRIu32/PRId32. You must confirm these are provided by standard headers or replaced by project-local macros that might use extensions. Also examine whether any local redefinitions use compiler-specific constructs.\n\nConciseness note: The above symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether lfs_format itself (after macro expansion and with the declared types/prototypes in scope) uses any language extensions. Specifically, macros (LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK/TRACE) and type/member declarations are the likely places where compiler-specific extensions could be introduced; PRIu32/PRId32 and uintptr_t must be checked to ensure they are the standard definitions (not extension wrappers)."
