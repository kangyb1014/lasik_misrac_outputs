  "explanation": "The fragments selected above are places where const-qualification may be being removed or where non-const pointers from the configuration object are forwarded/used (locking/unlocking and trace logging). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter cfg is already a pointer-to-const (const struct lfs_config *cfg); numeric members (read_size, prog_size, block_size, block_count, block_cycles, cache_size, lookahead_size, name_max, file_max, attr_max) are non-pointer scalar types; casting of lfs (a non-const lfs_t * parameter) to void* for logging is consistent with it being a modifiable object; the call to lfs_format_(lfs, cfg) forwards the same cfg pointer (already const) and so does not on its face drop const qualification. The trace arguments that are integer/size values or cfg->context are not pointer-to-non-const issues under Rule 8.13. Therefore only the listed fragments that explicitly remove or propagate non-const pointer types warrant further investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
