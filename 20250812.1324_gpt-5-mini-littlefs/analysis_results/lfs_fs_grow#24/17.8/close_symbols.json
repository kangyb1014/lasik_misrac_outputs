  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_grow_: required to confirm how the arguments are passed on to the callee and to check whether any inline/visibility detail (e.g. macro/inline expansion) could rewrite or otherwise mutate the caller's parameter variables. Although changes to objects pointed to are allowed, we must ensure the call expression itself does not cause an assignment to the parameter variables.\n- LFS_LOCK: macro/function used with lfs->cfg. We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not perform any hidden assignments that could modify the parameter variable 'lfs' itself (for example via complex macro tricks) or reassign the parameter identifier; it may legitimately modify *lfs->cfg (allowed) but must not assign to the parameter lfs.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (ensure no hidden assignment to the parameter variable 'lfs').\n- LFS_TRACE: used with both (void*)lfs and block_count; inspect its expansion to ensure it does not contain constructs that modify the parameter variables or use comma/assignment operators that would assign to block_count or lfs.\n- lfs_t (type definition, including cfg member): needed to determine whether the parameter declaration actually hides qualifiers (e.g. typedefs to pointer types, const qualifiers, or unusual member types) and to understand the type of lfs->cfg passed into the lock/unlock macros so we can tell what those macros may legally modify (object vs parameter).\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): needed to know if block_count has any special qualifiers (e.g. const, volatile, or is a wrapper type) or representation that could affect whether expressions using it in macros might modify the parameter itself.\n\nProvide the source (or macro definitions and type declarations) for each symbol so the next agent can verify whether any of them cause assignments to the function parameters (lfs or block_count)."
