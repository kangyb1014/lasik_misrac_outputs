  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension use:\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro): The call to LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) may expand to compiler-specific constructs (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, inline assembly, __builtin_*, __extension__, etc.). Inspecting its definition is necessary to determine if any non\u2011standard extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro): Same as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock macro may hide compiler extensions; its expansion must be inspected.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): LFS_TRACE is a logging/trace macro used in the function. Such macros commonly use variadic macros, compiler builtins, or attributes; they can also embed format helpers or non\u2011portable pragmas. The macro definition is needed to verify it uses only standard C features.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef / struct definition, including member cfg): The type of the first parameter lfs is needed to confirm that its definition does not use language extensions (e.g., anonymous structs/unions, designated initializer extensions, non\u2011standard attributes attached to the type, or compiler-specific storage-class extensions).\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg member's type and definition): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK receive lfs->cfg. The cfg member's type definition may itself contain extensions (attributes, compiler-specific types) that would make the call use extensions indirectly; inspect its definition.\n\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): The block_count parameter uses lfs_size_t and the PRIu32 format macro. The typedef could be an alias to a compiler intrinsic or use non\u2011standard typedef constructs; check its definition for extensions.\n\n- PRIu32 (macro from <inttypes.h> or equivalent): The code uses the PRIu32 format macro in the LFS_TRACE call. Although PRIu32 is a standard C macro (C99/inttypes.h), some projects redefine or wrap it. Confirm the actual macro in the build is the standard one and does not rely on compiler extensions.\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_ (declaration/definition): The callee could be a macro or an inline function annotated with compiler-specific attributes (e.g., always_inline, section, no_instrument_function) or use extensions in its prototype. Confirming its declaration/definition ensures the call in lfs_fs_grow does not rely on language extensions.\n\nThese symbols cover all macros, types, and called declarations from the target function that could hide compiler-specific language extensions. Inspecting their definitions is sufficient to determine whether lfs_fs_grow uses any explicitly documented compiler extensions."
