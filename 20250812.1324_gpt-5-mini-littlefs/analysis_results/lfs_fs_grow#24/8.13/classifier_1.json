  "scenario": "The fragment casts lfs (type lfs_t *) to (void*) for printing. By itself this does not violate Rule 8.13. However, a concrete violation would occur if the lfs parameter could and should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const lfs_t *lfs) because the function does not modify the object; then casting that const-qualified pointer to (void*) would discard the const qualifier and thus violate Rule 8.13."
