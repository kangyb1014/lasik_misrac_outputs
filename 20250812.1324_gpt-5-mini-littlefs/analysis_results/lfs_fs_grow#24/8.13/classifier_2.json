  "scenario": "The single call LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) does not by itself violate Rule 8.13. Whether there is a rule breach depends on the declarations that are not shown: if lfs->cfg is declared as a pointer to a non-const type and the unlock operation (and LFS_UNLOCK's parameter) do not modify the pointed-to object, then the pointer should be const-qualified and that would violate Rule 8.13. Conversely, if the unlock operation (or other uses of cfg) may modify the pointed-to data (or the API is designed to require a non-const pointer), then a non-const pointer is appropriate and there is no violation. Given only the fragment, there is no evidence of a definite violation."
