  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (pointer should point to const whenever possible):\n\n- struct lfs_t\n  Needed to know the exact type of the first parameter (lfs_t *lfs) and to inspect its members. The const-qualification of pointer fields inside lfs_t (or if lfs itself should be a pointer-to-const) can affect whether passing lfs (or its members) violates the rule.\n\n- lfs->cfg (type of cfg field inside lfs_t)\n  The target function passes lfs->cfg into LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK. You must know the cfg field's declared type (and whether it is a pointer and whether that pointer or the pointee is const-qualified) to determine if these calls discard const or otherwise violate the rule.\n\n- lfs_removeattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path, uint8_t type)  // declaration/definition\n  lfs_removeattr calls lfs_removeattr_. If lfs_removeattr_ is declared/defined to take a non-const char *path (or otherwise accepts/propagates a non-const pointer), then passing a const char * from lfs_removeattr would discard const qualification and violate MISRA. You need the exact prototype (or body) to see if const is preserved or removed.\n\n- LFS_LOCK(...)  // macro/function definition\n  LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK's signature or macro expansion expects a non-const pointer (or casts away const), that could be a const-qualification violation. Inspecting its definition is required.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK(...)  // macro/function definition\n  Same reason as LFS_LOCK: the unlock call receives lfs->cfg and may accept/require a non-const pointer or perform casts; the definition shows whether const is discarded.\n\n- LFS_TRACE(...)  // macro/function definition\n  LFS_TRACE is called with (void*)lfs and path. Macros or variadic logging helpers sometimes cast or mutate arguments (or expect char *). You must inspect its definition to ensure passing a const char *path (and casting lfs to void*) does not remove const qualification or perform undefined casts that violate MISRA.\n\n(If you include the definition of lfs_removeattr_ rather than only its prototype, you may also need any further symbols it uses \u2014 e.g., lfs_commitattr \u2014 but those are only required if you inspect the callee implementation.)"
