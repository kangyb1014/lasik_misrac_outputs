  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or inline routine called with lfs->cfg. Its expansion could contain assignments to the parameter variable 'lfs' (or other side effects). To prove the target function does not modify its parameters you must inspect LFS_LOCK's definition.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion could modify local parameters or perform assignments; include its definition to ensure no parameter modification occurs.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked with the parameters (including casts). Macros can expand to code that assigns to or otherwise modifies parameter variables; include its definition to ensure it does not alter any function parameters.\n- lfs_removeattr_: Although called as a separate function, verify whether it is actually a function or a macro/inline that could expand into code modifying the caller's parameters. Include its prototype/definition to ensure it cannot modify the target function's parameters via expansion.\n- struct lfs_t (definition, incl. member 'cfg' and its type): The expression lfs->cfg is passed into LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; knowing the structure layout and the type of cfg is needed to inspect macros/functions above to see if they write through lfs or otherwise reassign the parameter 'lfs'.\n- PRIu8: The format macro used in LFS_TRACE; include its definition only if you must fully expand LFS_TRACE to ensure no hidden side effects via format macros (usually harmless, but included for completeness)."
