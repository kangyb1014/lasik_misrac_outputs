  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No use of GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The variadic macro LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) uses the standard C99 __VA_ARGS__ mechanism (a standard language feature, not a compiler extension). Its definition is empty in the snippet, so it does not rely on any non-standard behavior.\n- The PRIu8 token in the format string is the standard macro from <inttypes.h> for portable printf format specifiers; concatenation of string literals and macros for format specifiers is standard C behavior.\n- The comma operator in the macro LFS_LOCK ((void)cfg,0) and the cast-to-void in LFS_UNLOCK ((void)cfg) are standard C constructs, not extensions.\n- All integer types used (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t) are from the standard <stdint.h> and are not compiler extensions.\n- No inline functions, implicit fallthrough attributes, designated initializers, or flexible-array members that would indicate use of non-standard extensions are present in the shown fragments.\n\nBecause no explicit compiler-specific extensions (as documented by compilers) appear in the snippets, there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
