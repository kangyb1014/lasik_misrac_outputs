  "explanation": "For checking use of compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, types, or declarations referenced by the target function because extensions commonly appear there (attributes, statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, non-standard variadic handling, GNU token-pasting tricks, etc.). Briefly:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro/function-like construct used at the start. Macros often hide compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, asm, GCC/Clang builtins, special token-pasting like ##__VA_ARGS__). Inspect its definition to ensure it uses only standard C.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its definition may contain non\u2011standard constructs or attributes.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro expands into formatting and variadic behavior. Common extension red flags include use of GNU ##__VA_ARGS__, __attribute__ ((__format__)), __builtin_* functions, or other non\u2011standard features. Also it may expand to calls that use compiler-specific attributes.\n\n- lfs_removeattr_: You need the prototype/definition to check for non\u2011standard function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))), inline asm or other compiler-specific decoration that would be a language extension.\n\n- struct lfs_t: The full type definition is required to check for use of non\u2011standard members, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, bit-field types or attributes on the struct that are compiler extensions.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration type): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg. The cfg type/definition may itself use extensions (inline functions, attributes, special macros) that make the overall code rely on compiler extensions.\n\n- PRIu8 (inttypes.h macro): The format macro used in the format string. Although PRIu8 is standardized in C99, you must confirm you are using the standard macro (from <inttypes.h>) and not a project-specific redefinition that uses non\u2011standard tokens or behavior.\n\n- uint8_t (stdint.h typedef): The fixed-width integer typedef used in the signature; ensure it comes from the standard header and that there are no project redefinitions or non\u2011standard typedefs.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their header/source definitions) lets the analyser determine whether any of them introduce compiler-specific language extensions that would make the target function violate the MISRA rule."
