  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other byte-wise comparison) is present in the provided code fragments. The shown functions only call other functions (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, lfs_removeattr_, lfs_commitattr, lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit) and build tags/arguments; they do not perform any string comparisons themselves. The use of \"%s\" in LFS_TRACE is a format specifier for logging, not a string comparison. Because no memcmp calls or direct byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings appear in these fragments, there are no suspicious locations here for Rule 21.14. If investigation of other modules (e.g., implementations of lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_commit, or any underlying helpers/macros) is desired, those source locations should be provided since they could contain memcmp usage; they are not part of the supplied code and therefore are not flagged."
