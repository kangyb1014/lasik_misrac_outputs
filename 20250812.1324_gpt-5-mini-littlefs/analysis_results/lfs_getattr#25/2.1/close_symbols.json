  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol (concise):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/identifier is used at the start of lfs_getattr and its expansion could change control flow (e.g. perform longjmp, call exit, or be a noreturn function). You must inspect its definition to determine whether the code after the call can ever be reached.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: May be a macro or function used at function exit. If its expansion contains control-flow changes (return, longjmp, infinite loop) it can affect reachability analysis of code following points where it is used; verify its definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macro invoked twice in lfs_getattr. Tracing macros sometimes expand to (void)0 but could also contain control-flow altering code (early return, longjmp) in some builds; inspect its definition to ensure those calls do not make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- lfs_lock / lfs_unlock: Include the likely underlying function names that LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros may map to (if macros dispatch to these functions). Their signatures and attributes (e.g. noreturn) affect reachability.\n\n- lfs_getattr_: The internal worker called by lfs_getattr. If its declaration or definition has attributes (noreturn) or its body contains non-returning behaviour, the code after the call in lfs_getattr may be unreachable. You must examine its prototype and body.\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_min, lfs_tag_size: These are callees of lfs_getattr_. To determine whether lfs_getattr_ can return normally you must inspect its callees for non-returning behavior (e.g. infinite loops, exit) or other control-flow that would make lfs_getattr_ never return; that affects reachability of code after the lfs_getattr_ call in lfs_getattr.\n\n- lfs_t: The filesystem handle type used by lfs_getattr. Needed to resolve member access (lfs->cfg) when evaluating LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macro expansions and any control-flow dependent on structure contents.\n\n- lfs_cfg_t: The configuration/lock object type stored in lfs_t (commonly named cfg); required to understand what is passed into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and whether those operations can cause non-local control-flow.\n\n- lfs_ssize_t: Return type of lfs_getattr; knowing its definition is necessary to interpret the semantics of returned error codes and to check whether particular return statements are valid/used; not directly causing unreachable code but useful to fully reason about return paths.\n\n(Overall: analyze definitions/attributes of the listed macros/functions and the bodies of lfs_getattr_ and its callees to decide whether any statements in lfs_getattr are provably unreachable under the project's actual macro/function implementations.)"
