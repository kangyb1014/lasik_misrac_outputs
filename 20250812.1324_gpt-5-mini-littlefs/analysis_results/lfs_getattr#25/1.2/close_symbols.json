  "explanation": "Provide the definitions/bodies of these symbols so the analyzer can determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used (MISRA rule check requires inspecting non-local macros/functions/types that the target uses):\n\n- lfs_getattr_: the actual implementation invoked by lfs_getattr; it and anything it calls may contain compiler extensions (asm, typeof, __attribute__, builtins, statement-expressions, etc.).\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_min, lfs_tag_size: callees of lfs_getattr_ (from the static call graph). Each must be checked for use of compiler-specific extensions in their definitions or macros they use.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: macros or functions used to lock/unlock (called in the wrapper). Macros often hide extensions (inline asm, __attribute__, compiler builtins, statement expressions); need the exact macro/body.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro used with formatted strings and variadic args; macros can use compiler extensions (variadic macro is standard C99, but the macro body may use extensions). Inspect its definition to ensure no compiler-specific constructs are used.\n- lfs_t: the filesystem context type; its definition is needed to inspect field types (e.g., cfg) which could be typedefs or macros that use extensions.\n- (type of) lfs->cfg: the cfg field accessed by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; the type/definition of cfg may be a macro/typedef that uses extensions (e.g., GCC attributes, builtin types).\n- lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t: the typedefs used in function signature; their definitions may be implementation-specific or use compiler extensions (e.g., signedness via non-standard keywords or attributes).\n- PRIu8, PRIu32, PRId32: format macros expanded into the format string; include their definitions to ensure they are standard macros and not redefined with compiler-specific constructs.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/bodies) allows a complete check of whether any of the code paths reachable from lfs_getattr use language extensions that are documented as compiler-specific."
