  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for MISRA C string-bounds analysis:\n\n- lfs_getattr_: This is the direct helper called by lfs_getattr. Any string.h calls (memcpy/strlen/strncpy/...) that operate on path or buffer will be in this implementation; you must inspect it to determine whether out-of-bounds accesses can occur.\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get: These directory helper functions are called (directly or indirectly) from lfs_getattr_. Directory code commonly copies or compares names/metadata and may call memcpy/memcmp/strlen/strncpy; include their implementations to check argument sizes and bounds checks.\n\n- lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_size: Tag-parsing utilities may manipulate byte buffers and length fields. They might use memmove/memcpy or other byte/string operations that could read/write beyond buffers provided by lfs_getattr_/directory code; include them to verify safe sizes.\n\n- lfs_min: Used to compute copy lengths and bounds. If it is a macro or inline, its definition affects how lengths passed to string routines are computed; include to ensure min operations are correct and don't result in oversized copies.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): lfs_getattr passes the lfs pointer through to helpers. The structure definition (and relevant members such as cfg, any internal buffers or path/name caches) is needed to understand buffer lifetimes, sizes, and whether pointers passed into string functions are valid and sized correctly.\n\n- lfs_size_t and lfs_ssize_t (typedefs): The size and signed-size types determine ranges and conversions used when calling string functions (e.g., casting, negative values). Knowing their width/semantics is required to reason about length arguments to memcpy/strncpy and to detect potential integer-related bound issues.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: Locking macros/functions may be no-ops, but if they evaluate parameters or expand to code that touches buffers (unlikely but possible), they must be inspected to ensure they do not call string functions or otherwise affect buffer validity.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/logging macro or function often formats strings (may call snprintf, strlen, memcpy). Because lfs_getattr calls LFS_TRACE with path and buffer pointers, inspect LFS_TRACE to ensure it does not call string.h functions in a way that could read beyond the provided path or buffer objects.\n\nIncluding the above symbols (implementations/definitions) is sufficient to follow all code paths originating from lfs_getattr that could invoke functions from <string.h>, to verify whether any such calls could access memory beyond the bounds of their pointer operands."
