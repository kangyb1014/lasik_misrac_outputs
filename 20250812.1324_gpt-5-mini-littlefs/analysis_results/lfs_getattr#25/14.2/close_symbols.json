The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_getattr (and its transitive callees) violate the MISRA C rule on well-formed for-loops you must examine any for-loops in the target and in any functions called from within those loop bodies (the rule counts behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body). Therefore you need the following symbols:\n\n- lfs_getattr_: The direct worker called by lfs_getattr; any for-loops will almost certainly be here. Inspect its loop clauses and bodies for loop counters, side-effects, and use of other objects.\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_min, lfs_tag_size: These are the callees of lfs_getattr_. If any of these are invoked inside a for-loop in lfs_getattr_ (or themselves contain for-loops), their implementations must be checked because their behaviour counts as part of the for-loop body. In particular verify they do not modify loop counters or other objects used in the for clause, and that they have no persistent side-effects used in the loop condition.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: These macros/functions appear in lfs_getattr and may expand to code that contains loops or side effects. They must be checked to ensure they do not introduce modifications to loop counters or persistent side-effects that would violate the three clauses (or the single-counter/flag restriction).\n\nYou do not need formatting macros (PRIu8/PRIu32) for this rule. Also inspect any global/state objects referenced by the above functions (e.g., lfs_t members) when reviewing the implementations, since the rule forbids use of objects in the second/third clause that are modified inside the loop body."
