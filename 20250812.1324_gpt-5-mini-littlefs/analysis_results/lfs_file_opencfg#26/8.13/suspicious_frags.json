  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified or they already use appropriate const qualification: - The final trace and return lines (e.g. LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_opencfg -> %d\", err); and return err;) do not perform pointer conversions or declare pointer types. - The path parameter is already declared as const char * and therefore satisfies the rule. - The integer flags and local integer err are non-pointer scalar types and not relevant to pointer const-qualification. - Simple use of cfg->attr_count (an integer) or formatting strings do not involve pointer type qualification. The listed fragments are those that involve pointer declarations, pointer arguments, or casts that may remove or fail to use const qualifiers and therefore warrant further inspection for compliance with Rule 8.13."
