  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_rename violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must inspect any code that could write to the parameter variables (lfs, oldpath, newpath) or expand inline into code that does so. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): lfs_rename calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it might contain statements that assign to local variables or even to the parameter 'lfs' (e.g. by reusing the identifier). If it is a function we must inspect its prototype/side-effects to ensure it does not modify the caller's parameter objects. We need the macro/function definition to be sure no assignment to the parameter variables occurs.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the unlock call near the end of the function.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro) and any underlying function(s): LFS_TRACE is used with the parameters (void*)lfs, oldpath, newpath. If LFS_TRACE is a macro it can expand to code that assigns to or modifies these identifiers (or casts away const and writes). Even if it calls an underlying function, we need the underlying implementation to confirm it does not modify the caller's parameter variables. Thus we need the macro expansion and any called helper functions.\n\n- lfs_rename_ (declaration/definition): lfs_rename simply forwards its parameters to lfs_rename_. If lfs_rename_ is actually a macro or an inline function it could expand into code that modifies the caller's parameter variables. Even if it is a normal function, its prototype/definition will show whether it is actually a macro/inline that could affect caller scope. We need to confirm that the call cannot result in modifications of the target function's parameters.\n\n- lfs_t (struct definition) and the type/definition of its cfg member: the code dereferences lfs->cfg. To reason about whether accessing lfs->cfg (and passing it to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK) could modify the parameter 'lfs' or its members, we need the lfs_t layout and the cfg member's type (in case cfg is a macro or has special semantics). Also useful to confirm whether lfs is declared as a pointer to non-const (so assignment to the parameter would be syntactically allowed) and to see if any macros use the member name 'cfg' in a way that could affect the lfs parameter.\n\nProviding these symbol definitions (macro expansions and function/struct definitions) is sufficient to check whether any expansions or calls inside lfs_rename perform assignments to the parameter variables (lfs, oldpath, newpath) and thus would violate the MISRA rule."
