  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in lfs_fs_gc is unreachable you must know all called-symbol behavior and any macros that can perform non\u2011local control flow or unconditional returns.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: could be a macro or function that performs non-local control flow (longjmp/exit/abort) or otherwise never returns or always returns a particular value; this affects reachability of the rest of the function (the early return branch and whether subsequent code is executed).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: may perform non\u2011local control flow (or be a no-op); its definition is needed to know whether the code after lfs_fs_gc_ (the trace, unlock, and final return) is reachable or can be skipped by the unlock itself.\n- LFS_TRACE: often a macro; although typically side\u2011effect free, it could hide control flow (e.g. debug hooks that abort/return). Its expansion must be checked to rule out hidden non\u2011local exits that would make later statements unreachable.\n- lfs_fs_gc_: the called helper \u2014 its body/contract must be inspected to determine whether it ever returns normally. If lfs_fs_gc_ never returns (infinite loop, exit, longjmp) then the trace/unlock/return following the call are unreachable.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: these are direct callees of lfs_fs_gc_. Any of them could perform non\u2011local control flow or otherwise make lfs_fs_gc_ non\u2011returning; their implementations are needed to conclude whether lfs_fs_gc_ always returns and therefore whether code after its invocation in lfs_fs_gc is reachable.\n- lfs_t (type and lfs->cfg member type/definition): the type and the cfg member are required to fully understand LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK semantics (they take lfs->cfg) and any inlined behavior that depends on the cfg contents.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions allows a static determination of whether any path through lfs_fs_gc leads to statements that can never be executed (MISRA C unreachable code)."
