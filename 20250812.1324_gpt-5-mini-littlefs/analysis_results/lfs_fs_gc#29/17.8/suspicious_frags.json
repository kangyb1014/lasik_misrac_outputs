  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The parameter lfs (a pointer) is never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise re\u2011bound inside lfs_fs_gc. Uses of lfs are limited to: (1) reading lfs->cfg as an argument to macros LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (the provided macro definitions evaluate ((void)cfg,0) and ((void)cfg) respectively, which do not modify the pointer or the pointed object), (2) passing lfs to lfs_fs_gc_ (passing a pointer by value does not modify the pointer parameter itself; the callee may modify the object pointed to, which is permitted by the rule), and (3) casting lfs to (void*) for LFS_TRACE (the trace macro is empty and a cast/usage does not modify the parameter). Therefore no code in the function modifies the pointer parameter itself, and no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
