  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (why needed to check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds use of <string.h> functions):\n- lfs_fs_gc_: direct callee of the target. Any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* inside it directly determines compliance.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency: called (transitively) by lfs_fs_gc_; may copy or compare metadata buffers and thus may call string.h functions that must be bounded.\n- lfs_pair_isnull: likely inspects or compares pair structures (could use memcmp or similar); need its implementation to see if it accesses beyond object bounds.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: reads directory entries into buffers; commonly uses memcpy/memmove/strlen. Its code and buffer handling are required to determine safe bounds.\n- lfs_dir_commit: writes/updates directory entries; may use memcpy/memmove/memset or string functions \u2014 must inspect its buffer sizes and copy lengths.\n- lfs_alloc_scan: scans/allocation bookkeeping that may use memory operations on arrays or bitmaps; its buffer accesses must be checked.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: macros/functions used by the target \u2014 they may reference lfs->cfg or other buffers; need to ensure locking code does not perform unsafe string operations or alter buffers used by callees.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function used in the target; trace implementation may call snprintf/str* or copy strings \u2014 must be checked for bounded usage.\n- lfs_t (type definition): the target receives a pointer to this type; its fields determine what buffers (sizes, pointers) are passed to callees and how large copies may be. Required to reason about object bounds.\n- lfs_config / lfs->cfg (configuration type): lfs->cfg is passed to lock/unlock and is commonly the source of block/buffer sizes and pointers used by internal functions; needed to determine allowed copy lengths.\n- lfs_pair_t (pair structure): used by pair-related helpers; its layout/size is needed to verify memcmp/memcpy usages are within bounds.\n- lfs_dir_t (directory entry structure): layout/size used by dir_fetch/dir_commit; required to check that any string/memory operations do not exceed entry buffers.\n\nInclude the implementations and type definitions for the listed functions/macros/types in the next agent's prompt so it can trace all memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/str* usages and verify that copy/compare lengths are bounded by the actual object sizes."
