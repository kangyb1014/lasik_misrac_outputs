  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must examine the definitions/declarations that the function invokes or depends on, because those may expand to or declare extension constructs. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked as a macro or function. Its definition may expand to compiler-specific constructs (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __builtin_*, inline asm, __attribute__, or other vendor extensions). Inspecting its definition is necessary to detect such extensions.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation may use language extensions; the call-site alone does not reveal that.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function does formatted tracing with arguments. Its macro definition is commonly variadic or may use wrapper heuristics that rely on compiler extensions (variadic macro tricks, statement-expression, typeof, __attribute__((format(...))), or GCC/clang builtins). You must inspect the actual macro/function body to determine whether any non\u2011standard extensions are used.\n\n- lfs_dir_close_ (declaration/definition): The prototype or definition of the callee may carry function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))), GCC/MSVC specific calling conventions, or other extensions. To be sure the call in the target function does not implicitly rely on extensions, inspect the declaration/definition.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition): The target function dereferences lfs->cfg. The type definition of lfs_t may include non\u2011standard members, bit\u2011field uses, unnamed members, attributes (packed/aligned), zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific constructs. These are language extension candidates and must be checked.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (typedef/struct definition): The function accepts a pointer to this type and casts it to (void*) for tracing. The type definition should be inspected for any compiler-specific constructs or attributes.\n\n- struct lfs_config (type of lfs->cfg): Because the target calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) the exact type of the cfg member (typically a struct or pointer type) may matter \u2014 its definition may contain compiler extensions (attributes, packed/aligned, layout pragmas, zero-length arrays, flexible/unnamed members, etc.). Inspecting this type lets you detect those extensions.\n\nInclude the headers/files that provide these definitions (the header where LFS_* macros are defined and the header(s) that define lfs_t, lfs_dir_t and struct lfs_config) when passing these symbols to the next agent so it can inspect them for compiler-specific language extensions."
