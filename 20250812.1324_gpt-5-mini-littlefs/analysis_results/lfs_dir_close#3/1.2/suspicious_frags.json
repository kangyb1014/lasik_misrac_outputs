  "explanation": "The only construct that may rely on a compiler-specific language extension is the use of __VA_ARGS__ as the macro parameter name in the LFS_TRACE definition and its invocations. Other parts of the code use standard C constructs: the (void) cast to mark unused parameters, the comma operator in the LFS_LOCK macro ((void)cfg,0), the (void*) pointer casts, the use of %p/%d formatting in trace calls, and the function/return structure of lfs_dir_close \u2014 none of these are compiler language extensions and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 1.2."
