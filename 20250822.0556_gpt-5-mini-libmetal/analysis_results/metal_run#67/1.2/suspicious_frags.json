  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 1.2 because they do not use compiler language extensions: \n- The calls to pthread_create, pthread_join, strerror, metal_log and use of EINVAL are calls to POSIX/library APIs or macros, not language extensions.\n- Pointer casts such as (pthread_t *)tids and (void *)tids are standard C casts, not compiler extensions.\n- Control-flow constructs (for loops, if checks, return statements) and local variables (int error, i, ts_created) are standard C.\n- The negation of the pthread_create return and assignment patterns are valid C expressions, not language extensions.\nTherefore only the array declaration shown above should be investigated further for possible use of a compiler language extension (variable-length array usage in that declaration)."
