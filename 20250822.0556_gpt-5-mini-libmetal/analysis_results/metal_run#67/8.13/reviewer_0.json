True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nmetal_finish_threads is declared as void metal_finish_threads(int threads, void *tids) and the implementation only reads from the tids buffer (it casts to pthread_t * and calls pthread_join). The pointer parameter therefore should be const-qualified (e.g. const void *tids or const pthread_t *tids). Passing (void *)tids from metal_run thus uses a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer is possible \u2014 this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Suggested fix: change the function prototype to accept a const pointer and use const pthread_t *tid_p = (const pthread_t *)tids; so the caller can pass tids without casting.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390360\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390360\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390368\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390378\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390380\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390388\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff63390390\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff63390398\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff633903a0\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff633903a8\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390360)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390360\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390378\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390380\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390388\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390390\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390398\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff633903a0\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff633903a8\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff633903b0\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff633903b8\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390370)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390370\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390378\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390380\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390388\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390390\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390398\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff633903a0\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff633903a8\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff633903b0\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff633903b8\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390370)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390370\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390320\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390320\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390328\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390330\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390338\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390340\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390348\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff63390350\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff63390358\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff63390360\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff63390368\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390320)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390320\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390320\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390320\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390328\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390330\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390338\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390340\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390348\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff63390350\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff63390358\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff63390360\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff63390368\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390320)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390320\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  tids array address (passed as (void *)tids) = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[0] address = 0x7fff63390370\n  tids[1] address = 0x7fff63390378\n  tids[2] address = 0x7fff63390380\n  tids[3] address = 0x7fff63390388\n  tids[4] address = 0x7fff63390390\n  tids[5] address = 0x7fff63390398\n  tids[6] address = 0x7fff633903a0\n  tids[7] address = 0x7fff633903a8\n  tids[8] address = 0x7fff633903b0\n  tids[9] address = 0x7fff633903b8\n  About to call metal_finish_threads(ts_created=10, (void *)tids=0x7fff63390370)\nmetal_run POSTCALL: threads=10, ts_created=10, error=0\n  Returned from metal_finish_threads. tids array address = 0x7fff63390370\nmetal_run PRECALL: threads=10, ts_\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_run:\nint metal_run_noblock(int threads, metal_thread_t child,\n\t\t     void *arg, void *tids, int *threads_out)\n{\n\tint error, i;\n\tpthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids;\n\n\tif (!tids) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"invalid argument, tids is NULL.\\n\");\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\n\terror = 0;\n\tfor (i = 0;

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. metal_finish_threads takes a void * parameter, but its implementation only reads the array (it casts to pthread_t * and calls pthread_join). Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer parameter that does not modify the pointed-to objects should be declared to point to a const-qualified type. Therefore metal_finish_threads should be changed to accept a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *tids or const pthread_t *tids) and use a const cast inside (const pthread_t *tid_p = (const pthread_t *)tids). metal_run_noblock must remain non-const because it writes into the tids buffer, but metal_finish_threads is a clear candidate for const qualification. The suggested fix in the scenario is appropriate."
