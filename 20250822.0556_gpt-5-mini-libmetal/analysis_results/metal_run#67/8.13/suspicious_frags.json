  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the places where a pointer to the thread id array is accepted/used only for reading and therefore merit investigation for const-qualification. Other pointers in the code were not included because they are either written to or forwarded to thread entry points and thus cannot trivially be made const: - metal_run_noblock's tids buffer is populated via pthread_create (tid_p[i] is written), so it must be a non-const pointer. - The threads_out (int *threads_out) parameter is written to and therefore must be non-const. - The arg parameter passed to threads is forwarded to the thread function; the thread entry-point may expect to modify that data, so it is not safe to assume it can be const without changing the thread-function API. - The casts from void * to pthread_t * in metal_run_noblock are required because the API uses void *; those conversions involve storing into the array and are not candidates for const. Therefore only the metal_finish_threads definitions and its call site (which currently pass a non-const void *) are flagged as suspicious for possible conversion to accept a const-qualified pointer (e.g., const void * or const pthread_t *), since metal_finish_threads only reads the array."
