Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_run violates the MISRA rule for well-formed for loops you must examine any for-loops that are present in code that is effectively inside metal_run. Although metal_run itself has no for statement textually, a called routine implemented as a macro or as a static inline will expand into caller code and may introduce for loops that are subject to the rule. Therefore you need:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (declaration and full definition/body; and whether it is a macro/static inline): metal_run calls this symbol and it may contain for loops or expand into caller code. The rule treats the behaviour of called functions that are expanded into the loop body (macros/inline) as part of the loop body \u2014 you must see the body to check loop clauses, loop counters, side effects and which objects are modified.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (declaration and full definition/body; and whether it is a macro/static inline): passed (void *)tids \u2014 if this symbol is a macro or inline function it could expand into code (for loop) that directly uses/changes tids or other local objects in the caller. You must inspect its code to check the three clauses, the loop counter usage, and whether objects modified in the body are referenced in the loop control.\n\n- Any header macro/inline expansion that defines metal_run_noblock or metal_finish_threads: if these are macros or inline functions, you need the actual expanded source (from headers) because loop text may be present only after expansion.\n\n- Any functions called (callees) inside metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads (their definitions): the MISRA rule counts the behaviour of functions called within a for loop body. If those callees contain loops or modify objects used by an enclosing loop control, you must inspect them too (transitive analysis).\n\n- metal_thread_t typedef / definition and pthread_t typedef / definition: to understand the types of tids and child arguments and whether passing (void *)tids or operations on tids in any loop can cause aliasing or hidden side effects relevant to loop-control object usage.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/implementations, not just declarations) lets the next analyst see whether any for loops exist in code that is textually or behaviourally part of metal_run, and whether their first/second/third clauses and loop-counter usage violate the MISRA constraints."
