  "explanation": "To decide if metal_run violates the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions we must inspect any control statements that could be executed as part of this call. metal_run itself has no loops or conditionals, but it calls metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads; those functions may contain loops/conditionals whose controlling expressions could be invariant. Therefore we need:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (declaration + definition): to examine its control statements (for/while/do/if) and determine whether any controlling expressions are invariant or depend only on constants or values that do not change (including how it sets ts_created and how it uses the tids buffer).\n\n- metal_finish_threads (declaration + definition): to inspect any loops that iterate over the tids array or ts_created and check whether the loop controlling expressions can be invariant (for example, if it uses a constant bound or a value that does not change inside the loop).\n\n- metal_thread_t (typedef/definition): to understand the semantics of the child argument if metal_run_noblock or metal_finish_threads base loop conditions on properties of the thread type or its fields.\n\n- pthread_t (typedef/definition): to understand the tids array element type if the callees perform operations or checks on tids that could affect loop conditions (size/representation rarely affects the invariance check, but the type must be known to interpret any expressions involving tids elements).\n\n- Any global variables and helper functions referenced by metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads that appear in loop/conditional controlling expressions: if those callees use globals or call other helpers to compute loop bounds or predicates, those symbols must be inspected to see if the predicates are invariant (e.g. a loop conditioned on a global flag that never changes).\n\nIn short: the two callees and any symbols they use in their control expressions are required so we can literally inspect the controlling expressions and decide whether they are invariant (except for allowed exceptions). Without the callees' code and the definitions of types/globals they depend on, we cannot determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
