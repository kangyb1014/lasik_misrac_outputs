  "explanation": "No other fragments in the function can produce unreachable code: the remaining items are simple local declarations (int error, ts_created) and the function signature. There are no conditional statements, loops, labels, or additional statements in this function beyond the listed lines, so all potential causes of unreachable code within this function are contained in the reported fragments. Therefore no other code fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1 in this function."
