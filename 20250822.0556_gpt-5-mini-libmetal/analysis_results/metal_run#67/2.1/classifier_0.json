  "scenario": "No violation: the statement is reachable in normal control flow \u2014 it calls metal_run_noblock and assigns its return value to error. This does not introduce unreachable code by itself. (A violation would occur only if metal_run_noblock were declared/defined as non-returning \u2014 e.g. marked noreturn or always calling exit/longjmp \u2014 which would render the subsequent metal_finish_threads/return unreachable.)"
