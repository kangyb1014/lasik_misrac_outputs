  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown code: metal_finish_threads is reachable because control returns from metal_run_noblock and execution continues to that call. A violation would occur if metal_run_noblock were non\u2011returning (for example declared with a noreturn attribute or implemented to always call exit/longjmp/pthread_exit/abort), in which case the call to metal_finish_threads would be unreachable."
