  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (definition/prototype): metal_run's only read/write of locals (error, ts_created) and the population of the tids array happen via this call. To determine whether removal of following operations (the tids allocation, the metal_finish_threads call, or even the call to metal_run_noblock itself) would change program behaviour, you must inspect what metal_run_noblock actually does (side effects, whether it creates threads, whether it writes tids and ts_created, whether it can be a no-op). The implementation and prototype reveal side effects and parameter semantics.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (definition/prototype): metal_run calls this unconditionally after metal_run_noblock. If metal_finish_threads is a no-op under some builds or does important cleanup (joins, frees, synchronization), that determines whether the call is required. Its implementation shows whether the call is dead (removable) or not.\n\n- metal_thread_t (typedef): metal_run declares parameter type metal_thread_t for the thread entry; the semantics of thread creation and how tids are used may depend on this typedef. Also, the meaning of casting tids to (void *) for metal_finish_threads depends on the expected thread identifier type; knowing the typedef helps judge correctness and side effects.\n\n- pthread_t (typedef / pthread headers): tids is an array of pthread_t. To reason about allocation, lifetime, and whether the array contents matter (e.g., used by joins), the pthread_t definition and pthread API semantics (from headers) are needed. Also required to check whether a VLA of pthread_t with threads==0 is legal/portable and whether that could produce dead/undefined behaviour.\n\n- Any functions called by metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads (e.g. pthread_create, pthread_join, pthread_detach): to decide if removing metal_finish_threads (or the tids array) changes behaviour you must see the sequence of thread lifecycle operations performed by the callees. If they call pthread_create and later pthread_join/detach, those are essential side effects; if they don't, the call might be redundant.\n\n- Compilation/configuration macros used by the above implementations (e.g. feature flags that make them no-ops): many embedded projects conditionally compile thread support\u2014metal_finish_threads or metal_run_noblock might be compiled out or turned into stubs depending on macros. The presence/values of such macros determine if a call is actually effective or dead code in a given build.\n\n- Callers of metal_run to determine typical 'threads' argument values: atomic, mutex, shmem, condition, spinlock: the value(s) passed for the threads parameter affect whether the VLA tids[threads] is non-empty and whether the callees create any threads. If all call sites pass threads==0 or otherwise lead to no threads created, some operations in metal_run may be dead. Inspecting these callers shows realistic argument ranges and whether removal would alter observable behaviour.\n\nCollecting the implementations/prototypes and the compile-time flags for these symbols allows a determination of whether any operation in metal_run (array allocation, the call to metal_finish_threads, the cast) is executed but removable without changing program behaviour, which is the essence of the MISRA dead-code check."
