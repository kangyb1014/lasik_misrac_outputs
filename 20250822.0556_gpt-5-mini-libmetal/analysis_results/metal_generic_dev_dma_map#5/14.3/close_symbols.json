  "explanation": "METAL_DMA_DEV_W: You must know whether this is a macro/enum constant and its value/type to decide if the expression (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) can be an invariant (always true or always false) in any realistic compilation or if any implementation-defined mapping could make it constant.\n\nstruct metal_sg (definition): The loop and memcpy operate on struct metal_sg and use fields sg_out[i].virt and sg_out[i].len. You need the full definition to know the types of virt/len (and whether they are volatile or have unusual semantics), to check possible aliasing/side-effects and whether sizeof(struct metal_sg) is well\u2011formed/constant. This affects whether the conditional (sg_out != sg_in) or loop bounds could be considered invariant.\n\nmetal_cache_flush (prototype/definition): The function called from inside the conditional/loop might be a macro or function with side effects (it could, in principle, modify globals or memory that affect the loop condition). You need its declaration/definition to determine whether it can change any of the variables used in the controlling expressions (dir, nents_in, sg_out/sg_in) or otherwise make the controlling expression non-invariant.\n\nmetal_cache_invalidate (prototype/definition): Same rationale as metal_cache_flush \u2014 its implementation or macro form could have side effects that affect the controlling expressions (for example by modifying data reachable from sg_out) or be implemented in a way that changes control flow; its definition is required to rule that out.\n\nmemcpy (prototype/definition): Although memcpy is standard, you should confirm it is the normal library memcpy (no macro override) and has no side effects on the function parameters used in controlling expressions (sg_out, sg_in, nents_in). If memcpy were redefined as a macro/function with extra side effects it could affect invariance analysis."
