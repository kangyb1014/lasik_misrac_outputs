  "explanation": "METAL_DMA_DEV_W: The if (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) test is the only selector that can make the metal_cache_flush call unreachable. You must know the compile-time definition (enum/macro/value) to determine whether the comparison can ever be non-trivial or might be resolved to a constant across the project (or be defined as something that forces a constant result via preprocessor).\\n\\nstruct metal_sg: The loop body accesses sg_out[i].virt and sg_out[i].len and uses sizeof(struct metal_sg) in memcpy. The concrete definition (fields, sizes) is needed to determine whether the memcpy and the per-element cache calls are meaningful and whether any compiler/ABI/inlining/optimisation could make code paths unreachable (e.g., zero-sized objects, unusual field macros).\\n\\nmetal_cache_flush (declaration / macro): The symbol may be a function or a macro/inline that expands to nothing or to other constructs; if it is conditionally defined away or empty, the apparent call site might be removed by preprocessing/compilation and affect whether that statement is actually present/executable (important for determining unreachable code).\\n\\nmetal_cache_invalidate (declaration / macro): Same rationale as metal_cache_flush; its definition may alter whether the call is present or compiled out and thus whether code following/around it is reachable. Also needed because it is called unconditionally in the loop.\\n\\nmemcpy (declaration / macro): memcpy might be a macro or inline wrapper in the project (or mapped to a no-op in some configurations). Its definition affects whether the memcpy statement is actually emitted or removed, which matters when checking for unreachable statements/blocks.\\n\\n(These symbols are the project-level definitions that can make branches or call sites syntactically or effectively absent; they are required to decide if any portion of the function body can never be executed under any project configuration and therefore would violate the MISRA rule against unreachable code.)"
