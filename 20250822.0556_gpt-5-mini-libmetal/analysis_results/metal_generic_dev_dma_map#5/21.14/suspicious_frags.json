  "explanation": "No usage of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code. The function uses memcpy to copy an array of struct metal_sg and calls metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate for each entry; these are not string-comparison operations and do not involve null-terminated strings. No other C standard string-comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, memcmp) appear in the shown code or the related symbol definitions, so there are no fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
