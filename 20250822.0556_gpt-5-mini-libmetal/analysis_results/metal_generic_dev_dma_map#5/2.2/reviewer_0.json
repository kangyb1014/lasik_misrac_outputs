  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void)bus;\u201d (and the similar \u201c(void)device;\u201d) is an executed no\u2011op: it evaluates a non-volatile parameter but produces no side effects. Removing that statement does not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour (only compiler diagnostics), so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note that this is different from unreachable code or necessary initializations. If these casts are present only to suppress compiler warnings, they should be handled by a documented deviation or by other MISRA\u2011compliant means (for example omitting the parameter name in the function definition if allowed by the interface, or using an approved UNUSED macro/annotation)."
