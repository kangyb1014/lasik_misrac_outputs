  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u2018\u2018(void)dir;\u2019\u2019 is the common idiom to explicitly reference an otherwise unused parameter to suppress compiler warnings and to document intent. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets operations that are truly unnecessary dead code; the \u2018\u2018(void)dir;\u2019\u2019 is an explicit use of the parameter (it prevents an unused-parameter diagnostic) and is a deliberate, benign construct. Removing it does not change program semantics, but it does change the source-level intent and compiler diagnostics; MISRA guidance accepts the explicit use-of-parameter idiom to silence warnings rather than treating it as a defect. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
