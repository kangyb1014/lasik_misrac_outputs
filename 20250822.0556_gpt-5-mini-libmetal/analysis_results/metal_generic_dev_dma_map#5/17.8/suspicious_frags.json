  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Specific reasoning:\n- bus and device are only cast to void to suppress unused-parameter warnings ((void)bus; (void)device;). This does not modify the parameters.\n- dir is only compared (if (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W)) and never assigned to; no modification.\n- sg_out and sg_in are not reassigned (no statements like sg_out = ... or sg_in = ...). The call memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, ...) modifies the objects pointed to by sg_out/sg_in, which is explicitly permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but not the pointer itself).\n- nents_in is read but never written to; it is returned, not modified.\n- The loop index i is a local variable; operations like sg_out[i].virt and calls to metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate modify memory reachable via the pointer parameters, not the pointer parameters themselves.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
