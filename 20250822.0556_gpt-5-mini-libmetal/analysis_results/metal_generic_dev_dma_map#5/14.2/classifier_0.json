  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tif (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) {\n\t\t\tmetal_cache_flush(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t}\n\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\n#define METAL_DMA_DEV_W 2\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the for loop is well-formed. The loop uses a single loop counter i (declared as int i;), initialized in the first clause (i = 0), tested only against nents_in in the second clause (which is not modified in the loop body), and incremented only in the third clause (i++). The loop counter is not modified in the loop body. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated."
