First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the for-loop and the loop counter declaration are relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops). The declaration of the loop counter outside the for header and the for header itself should be inspected to ensure the first, second and third clauses comply with the rule and that the loop counter is not modified in the body. The called functions inside the loop (metal_cache_flush / metal_cache_invalidate) are included within the for-loop fragment because their behaviour forms part of the loop body and must be checked for side effects that could affect the clauses. Other code in the function does not need further investigation for Rule 14.2: (void)bus; (void)device; the memcpy before the loop is not part of the for-loop clauses (it executes prior to the loop); the return statement and function signature are unrelated to the structure of the for loop; and the provided type/macro definitions (struct metal_sg, METAL_DMA_DEV_W) are not themselves relevant to verifying the three clauses of the for statement. Therefore no additional fragments are reported."
