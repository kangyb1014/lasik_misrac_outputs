  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 indeed encourages that pointers should point to a const-qualified type when possible. From the body of metal_generic_dev_dma_map the parameter bus is unused (it is cast to void), so locally it would be safe to change the prototype to const struct metal_bus *bus. However, whether the code actually violates the rule depends on external constraints: if this function must match an existing non-const function prototype (for example it implements a callback or driver API whose signature requires struct metal_bus *), then the parameter cannot be changed to const without breaking the required prototype and the non-const declaration is intentional and acceptable. The agent\u2019s report asserts a violation unconditionally, but the source code alone does not prove that the signature could be changed safely in the wider context. Therefore the agent\u2019s blanket claim is not necessarily correct. If there is no API/prototype constraint, then the parameter should be const and the current code would be a violation; if there is such a constraint, then it is not a violation.\n\nRecommendation: if the function is free to change, declare the parameter as const struct metal_bus *bus (or remove it if not needed). If the signature must match an external API, document that constraint and suppress or justify the non-const parameter to satisfy MISRA requirements."
