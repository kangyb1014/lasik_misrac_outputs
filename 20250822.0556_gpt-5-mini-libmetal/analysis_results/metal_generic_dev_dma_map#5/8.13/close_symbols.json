  "explanation": "memcpy (declaration/prototype): needed to know the const-qualification of its parameters (memcpy takes a const void *src) so we can determine whether sg_in could/should be declared const struct metal_sg * (sg_in is only read and passed as memcpy source).\n\nmetal_cache_flush (declaration/prototype): needed to know the parameter types (does it take void * or const void *?) because sg_out[i].virt is passed to it; the prototype determines whether the pointed-to memory must be mutable and therefore whether struct metal_sg->virt (and thus sg_out) can be const-qualified.\n\nmetal_cache_invalidate (declaration/prototype): same reason as metal_cache_flush \u2014 its parameter constness affects whether the virt pointer (and/or struct metal_sg) must be non-const.\n\nstruct metal_sg (definition): required to see the types of its members (particularly the type of virt and whether members are already const-qualified). If virt is declared e.g. void * vs const void *, that directly affects whether sg_in/sg_out (or their elements) can be const-qualified.\n\nstruct metal_bus (definition) and struct metal_device (definition): these pointer parameters are unused in the function (cast to void), so to decide whether they should be const-qualified in the function signature we need their type definitions (and any API constraints) to ensure making them const is valid.\n\n(With these symbols we can determine which pointer parameters and struct members are only read and thus should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule, and which must remain mutable because they are written to or passed to APIs requiring non-const pointers.)"
