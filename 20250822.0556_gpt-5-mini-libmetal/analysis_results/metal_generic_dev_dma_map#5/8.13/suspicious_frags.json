  "explanation": "Fragments not listed need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because they either necessarily require a non-const target or do not declare pointer types. In particular:\n- \"struct metal_sg *sg_out\" is used as the destination and is modified (elements copied into it and its contents flushed/invalidated), so making it point to const would be inappropriate.\n- The calls to metal_cache_flush and metal_cache_invalidate operate on the memory pointed to by sg_out[i].virt; those are uses of pointers, not pointer declarations in this function, and whether those API parameters should be const must be checked in their own declarations, not here.\n- The local variable \"i\", the integer parameters like \"nents_in\" and \"dir\", and the return statement do not involve pointer declarations and so are outside the scope of Rule 8.13 for this function.\n- The memcpy destination being sg_out is already flagged (included above); other uses of sg_in/sg_out inside expressions are covered by inspecting the parameter declarations and the memcpy call.\nTherefore only the listed fragments need investigation for whether pointers could be const-qualified (notably sg_in, and the unused bus/device parameters)."
