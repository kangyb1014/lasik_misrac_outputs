  "explanation": "To determine whether the memcpy call in metal_generic_dev_dma_map can access beyond object bounds you must know the sizes of the source and destination objects and the number of bytes copied. The required symbols are:\n\n- struct metal_sg (full definition): memcpy copies nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) bytes; the exact value of sizeof(struct metal_sg) (including padding) and the types of its members (e.g., virt and len) are needed to compute the copy size and to reason about subsequent accesses to sg_out[i].virt/len.\n\n- Call sites / allocation sites that create/populate sg_in and sg_out and any metadata describing their allocated sizes: sg_in and sg_out are pointer parameters; to check bounds you must know how large the memory regions they point to are (number of elements allocated or total bytes). This requires the code or functions that allocate or pass these pointers (or any runtime/compile-time invariants about their sizes).\n\n- Specification/header comment for parameter nents_in (semantic contract): you need to know what nents_in means (e.g., number of entries available in sg_in and sg_out, or a requested count) and any preconditions (e.g., callers guarantee nents_in <= allocated entries). This determines whether the multiplication used for memcpy is valid.\n\n- memcpy declaration/definition (the <string.h> prototype / known semantics): to be explicit about the function being the standard byte-wise copy (dest, src, n) and that it will read/write exactly the requested number of bytes; MISRA rule applies specifically to these string.h functions, so the analyzer must confirm that this is the standard memcpy and understand its behavior.\n\nWith these symbols you can compute the number of bytes copied, compare that against the actual allocated bytes for sg_in and sg_out, and decide whether the memcpy can result in out-of-bounds accesses (i.e., a MISRA string.h bounds violation)."
