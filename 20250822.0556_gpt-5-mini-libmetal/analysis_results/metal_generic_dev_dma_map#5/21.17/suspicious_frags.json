  "explanation": "Only the memcpy call and subsequent indexed accesses of sg_out[i] need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule concerns use of <string.h> functions and any resulting accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. The memcpy invocation (including the computed size nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg))) can produce out-of-bounds accesses, integer/size overflow, or be unsafe for overlapping source/destination; the loop that follows dereferences sg_out[i] for nents_in elements and must be checked for valid allocation and bounds. Other fragments (function signature, (void)bus; (void)device; declaration int i; return nents_in; and the unrelated long sizes[max_sizes]) do not call string.h functions nor perform memory copies via those APIs, so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for this specific rule."
