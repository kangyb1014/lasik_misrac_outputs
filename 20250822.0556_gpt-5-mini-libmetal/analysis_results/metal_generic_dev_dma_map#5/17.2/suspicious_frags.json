  "explanation": "The body contains no direct call to metal_generic_dev_dma_map itself; the only function calls present are the three calls listed above. Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect recursion, so the listed calls must be investigated to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call back into metal_generic_dev_dma_map. Other code fragments (function signature, local variable declarations, the (void) casts for unused parameters, the if and for control structures, the METAL_DMA_DEV_W macro usage, and the return statement) contain no function calls or call-like constructs and therefore do not need investigation for recursion under Rule 17.2."
