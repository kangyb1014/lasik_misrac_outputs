  "explanation": "The only loop/control expression in this function is the for-loop condition. Other statements (the argument assignment, the metal_spinlock calls, the increment, the return) are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. There are no do-while constructs or explicit infinite-loop patterns in this function that would fall under the rule's exceptions. Therefore the for-loop condition is the sole fragment that must be investigated to determine whether its controlling expression is invariant."
