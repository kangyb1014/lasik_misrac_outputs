  "explanation": "1) spinlock_test_count (definition and any writers): The for-loop controlling expression is \"i < spinlock_test_count\". To decide if that expression can be invariant you must know spinlock_test_count's type, storage class, initializer, const/volatile/atomic qualifiers, and whether it is ever written to (including by other translation units or threads). If spinlock_test_count is a compile-time constant or never updated, the controlling expression could be invariant (always true or always false), which would be a MISRA concern. If it is modified concurrently (and declared volatile/atomic), the expression is not invariant. Hence the symbol definition and all places that write to it are required. \n\n2) total (definition): Although total does not appear in the loop controlling expression, its declaration (type/qualifiers) and any side-effects on globals are needed to rule out indirect effects on spinlock_test_count (for example, if total or its writers share state with spinlock_test_count or if writers are in called functions). At minimum this lets the analyzer confirm total cannot influence the loop control. \n\n3) metal_spinlock_acquire / metal_spinlock_release (definitions): These called functions execute inside the loop body. The analyzer must inspect their definitions to confirm they do not modify spinlock_test_count (or otherwise affect the loop-controlling expression) or perform actions that make a seemingly invariant expression actually variant (e.g., by updating global state visible to the loop condition). Also their side-effect/visibility annotations (e.g., memory barriers, volatile accesses) may affect whether an expression is considered invariant in a concurrent context."
