  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression 'i < spinlock_test_count' is variant because the loop increments 'i' each iteration (i++). A rule violation would occur only if the condition were invariant (e.g. a constant true/false) or the loop variable were never modified \u2014 for example: 'for (i = 0; i < spinlock_test_count; /* missing i++ */) { \u2026 }' or an explicit constant condition like 'for (;;)' or 'for (; 1; )'."
