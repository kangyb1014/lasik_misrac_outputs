  "explanation": "To decide whether spinlock_thread violates the MISRA rule against self-calls (direct or indirect) you must inspect not only the names already in the call-site but the actual code those names invoke and anything they in turn invoke. Specifically:\n\n- metal_spinlock_acquire: you must see its implementation (not just prototype). If it (directly or indirectly) calls spinlock_thread, that would be indirect recursion.\n\n- metal_spinlock_release: same reason as acquire.\n\n- <transitive callees of metal_spinlock_acquire> and <transitive callees of metal_spinlock_release>: any function called (directly or indirectly) from acquire/release must be checked; indirect recursion can occur several levels deep.\n\n- <any function-pointer variables referenced or assigned in the bodies of the above functions>: if acquire/release invoke function pointers (or obtain callbacks from globals) those pointers could point back to spinlock_thread at runtime; you must identify the pointer symbols and their assignments to determine possible indirect calls.\n\n- <any callback-registration functions used by the above functions>: if acquire/release register or invoke callbacks via registration APIs (e.g. install handler functions) you need the registration/handler symbols to see whether spinlock_thread can be invoked through those mechanisms.\n\nCollecting the implementations/bodies of these symbols (and any macros/inline/assembly used by them) is sufficient to determine whether any call chain from spinlock_thread leads back to spinlock_thread (i.e., whether direct or indirect recursion exists)."
