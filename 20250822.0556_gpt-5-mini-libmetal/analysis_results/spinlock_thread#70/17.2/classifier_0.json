  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: in the provided fragment, spinlock_thread calls metal_spinlock_release(l), which is a different function; there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion. A Rule 17.2 violation would occur only if metal_spinlock_release (or metal_spinlock_acquire) were implemented to call back into spinlock_thread or to call itself, creating a call cycle \u2014 which is not shown here."
