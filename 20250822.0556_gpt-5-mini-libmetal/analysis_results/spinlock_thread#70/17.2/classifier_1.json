  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: spinlock_thread calls metal_spinlock_acquire(l) but there is no evidence that metal_spinlock_acquire (or metal_spinlock_release) calls spinlock_thread or themselves. Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect recursion; calling an unrelated lock-acquire function does not violate it. A violation would only occur if metal_spinlock_acquire (directly or via other calls) invoked spinlock_thread or itself, which is not shown here."
