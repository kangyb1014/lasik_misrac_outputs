  "explanation": "- metal_spinlock_acquire (definition): The target calls this function. To determine whether the thread routine indirectly invokes any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, memset, etc.) or causes out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses, you must inspect the implementation of metal_spinlock_acquire.\n- metal_spinlock_release (definition): Same reason as above \u2014 the release implementation could use string functions or call other functions that do, so its body must be available for analysis.\n- struct metal_spinlock (complete type): The implementations of acquire/release may operate on fields of the struct (including pointers/arrays) using string functions; the complete type is needed to see sizes/offsets and whether any buffer pointers could be dereferenced out of bounds by string calls.\n- spinlock_test_count (definition and type): The loop bound is taken from this object. Its type and definition (e.g., signed/unsigned, range) are needed to check whether the loop could have a value that triggers unexpected behavior leading to calls to string functions or large/negative counts that affect indexes/lengths used by called functions.\n- total (definition and type): The routine increments total; its type (width, signedness, volatile) and declaration determine whether any wrappers or macros around increments could introduce calls into other code (unlikely but necessary to rule out indirect string usage) and to understand side effects visible to called functions.\n- any functions called by metal_spinlock_acquire/metal_spinlock_release (their transitive callees and definitions): If acquire/release call other helpers, those helpers must be inspected transitively for any use of <string.h> functions or buffer accesses that could go out of bounds. Include all transitive callees/definitions so the analysis can determine if any string handling functions are reachable from spinlock_thread.\n\nInclude these symbols (definitions, not just prototypes) so the next analyzer can trace direct and indirect uses of the <string.h> APIs and verify whether any such uses can access memory beyond object bounds."
