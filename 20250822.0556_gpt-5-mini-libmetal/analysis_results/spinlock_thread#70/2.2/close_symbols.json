  "explanation": "spinlock_test_count: determines how many times the loop body executes. If zero the loop body is not executed; to decide whether the loop operations are ever executed (and thus potentially dead) you must know this symbol's value and where it can be changed.\ntotal: the loop increments this global. To decide whether those increments are observable (i.e. removing them would change program behaviour) you must know where total is read/used elsewhere in the program.\nmetal_spinlock_acquire (definition): the acquire call may have side-effects (synchronization, memory barriers, timing, instrumentation) or access global state. You need the implementation to decide whether removing the call changes observable behaviour (including timing as per note 1).\nmetal_spinlock_release (definition): same rationale as acquire \u2014 its implementation may have observable side-effects or affect concurrency/timing; you must inspect it to determine if its removal would affect behaviour.\nstruct metal_spinlock (definition): the concrete structure may reveal whether acquire/release operate on shared state or are no-ops; useful when reasoning about side-effects of the above functions.\nall callers/refs to spinlock_thread (e.g. pthread_create or other thread-create calls in the translation unit): MISRA dead-code analysis must know whether the function is ever invoked. If spinlock_thread is never referenced/called (unreachable), it is not \"dead code\" per the note on unreachable code; if it is invoked (for example passed to thread creation), then its internal operations may be executed and must be checked for being dead. Inspecting all call sites (including indirect uses as a function pointer) is required."
