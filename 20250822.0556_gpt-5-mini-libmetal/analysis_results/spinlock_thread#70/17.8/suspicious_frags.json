  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter 'arg'. The only use of the parameter is to initialize a local pointer: 'struct metal_spinlock *l = arg;', which copies the pointer value but does not alter 'arg' itself. The code does not reassign, increment/decrement, or otherwise modify 'arg'. Calls that operate on '*l' (metal_spinlock_acquire/release) modify the object pointed to by the parameter, which is permitted by the rule. The global 'total' is modified, but it is not a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
