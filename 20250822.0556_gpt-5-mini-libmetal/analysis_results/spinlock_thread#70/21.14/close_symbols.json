  "explanation": "metal_spinlock_acquire / metal_spinlock_release: The target function only calls these two functions. You must inspect their declarations/implementations (and any transitive callees) to ensure they do not call or expand to memcmp (or call functions that do). struct metal_spinlock: The type passed to acquire/release could be tied to macros or inline functions that use string comparisons; its definition may reveal inline helpers or macro usages that call memcmp. spinlock_test_count / total: These identifiers are referenced in the loop and increment; they might be macros or functions (or be defined via expressions) that expand to or invoke other code that could call memcmp. memcmp: Include the standard symbol so the analyzer can identify any direct uses of memcmp (and check whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings) in the implementations of the above symbols or their callees."
