  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer 'l' is passed to metal_spinlock_release, which by its semantics modifies the spinlock state (releases the lock), so it must be a non-const pointer. Therefore Rule 8.13 (pointer should be to const when possible) is not violated here. (If the release API did not modify the object and could accept a const-qualified pointer, then using a non-const pointer would be a violation.)"
