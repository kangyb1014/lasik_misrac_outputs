  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining code does not involve pointer types that could require const-qualification: \n- \"int i;\" is a scalar local variable (not a pointer). \n- The for loop header and the use of \"spinlock_test_count\" are integer operations, not pointer usage. \n- \"total++;\" operates on a scalar counter, not a pointer. \n- \"return NULL;\" returns a null pointer literal (no object type to const-qualify in this context). \nTherefore these fragments are not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated."
