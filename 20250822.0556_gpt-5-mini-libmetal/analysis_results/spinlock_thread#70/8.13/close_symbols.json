  "explanation": "1) struct metal_spinlock (type definition): Needed to know the type being pointed to (l). Determining whether the object or its members are logically immutable (and therefore whether a pointer-to-const would be appropriate) requires the type layout and any qualifiers on its members. 2) metal_spinlock_acquire (declaration/prototype): The parameter type and const-qualification in this prototype show whether the function expects to modify the pointed-to spinlock. If the API requires a non-const pointer, making l (or arg) const would be infeasible. 3) metal_spinlock_release (declaration/prototype): Same reason as acquire \u2014 its parameter signature indicates whether the lock object is modified and therefore whether a const-qualified pointer would be possible. 4) thread-start routine prototype (e.g. pthread start signature void *(*)(void *)): The thread entry function signature mandates the type of the arg parameter. If the threading API requires void * (not const void *), that prevents changing the arg parameter to a const-qualified pointer even if the pointed-to object were not modified."
