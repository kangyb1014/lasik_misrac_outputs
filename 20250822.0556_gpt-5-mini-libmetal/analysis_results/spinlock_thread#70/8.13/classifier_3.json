  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the thread routine uses the argument to acquire/release the spinlock, which modifies the pointed-to object, so a non-const pointer is required. Also the pthread-style entry point must use void * by API. A violation would occur if the function only read the object (never modified it) but still took a plain void * (e.g. it only inspected the spinlock or passed it to functions taking const pointers); in that case the parameter should be const-qualified (const void * / const struct metal_spinlock *)."
