Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect any identifier that could introduce a for-loop (directly or via macro/inline expansion) or whose behaviour inside a call could be considered part of a for-loop body. For this target function the relevant symbols are:\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: may be a macro, inline function, or function; if it is a macro/inline and expands to a for-loop (or calls a function containing a for-loop), that loop would count toward the MISRA for-loop rule for this function.\n\n- snprintf: normally a library function, but it could be a macro/wrapper in this codebase; verify its definition to ensure no for-loops are introduced via macro expansion or inline implementation.\n\n- system: likewise could be a wrapper or macro; check its definition/implementation for any for-loops (or calls that contain for-loops) that would be part of the target function\u2019s behaviour.\n\n- metal_log: logging is often implemented as a macro that may expand to code (loops, calls); check whether metal_log is a macro or inline function and whether it contains for-loops or calls that contain for-loops.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: the token passed into metal_log might be a macro that triggers different logging code paths; include it when examining metal_log\u2019s expansion/implementation.\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition): fields accessed (drv_name, mod_name, sdrv) could be implemented via macros, accessors or have types whose operations involve macros/inline functions; inspect the struct and any associated accessors to ensure no for-loops are introduced via member access or via functions/macros tied to these members.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): same rationale for lbus->bus_name access \u2014 ensure that member access or associated accessors/macros do not introduce for-loops.\n\n- type/definition of ldrv->sdrv member: the member assigned/checked (sdrv) may be a complex type with overloaded semantics, macros, or accessor functions; examine its type/definition to ensure checking/assignment do not expand to code containing for-loops.\n\nYou do not need to inspect unrelated error-code macros (EOVERFLOW, ENODEV) or __func__ for this MISRA for-loop rule unless any of them are nonstandard macros that expand to code containing loops (which is very unlikely). The primary focus is on any symbols that could be macros/inline functions or whose implementation may contain for-loops that would count toward the rule when called/expanded inside this function."
