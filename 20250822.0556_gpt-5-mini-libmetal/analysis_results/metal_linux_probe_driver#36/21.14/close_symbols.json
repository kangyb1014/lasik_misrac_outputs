  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C rule analysis:\n- sysfs_open_driver: The function is called directly by the target. Its implementation may perform name comparisons (driver or module names) and could use memcmp on null-terminated strings; inspect it to determine any memcmp use.\n- metal_log: Logging helper called on error paths. Its implementation might use string comparison utilities; check it to rule out memcmp usage in the call chain.\n- system: Standard library call used here to invoke shell commands. Although typically not comparing strings, include it to be thorough (and to identify any project-provided wrapper of system that might use memcmp).\n- snprintf: Standard C function used to build command strings. Include to verify whether a local wrapper/alternative implementation exists in the project that might use memcmp for string comparisons.\n- memcmp: The symbol the MISRA rule targets. Search for its uses in the implementations of the above symbols (and project-wide) to determine if any memcmp calls are applied to null-terminated strings reachable from the target function.\n- struct linux_driver (fields: sdrv, drv_name, mod_name): The target reads/writes these fields. Knowing their types (char *, char [], etc.) is necessary to determine whether downstream functions compare these fields as null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n- struct linux_bus (field: bus_name): Passed into sysfs_open_driver; its type (string/char pointer) and usage can indicate whether memcmp could be used on a null-terminated string.\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: Logging level macro used with metal_log; include to locate the logging code path precisely when inspecting metal_log implementation.\n- EOVERFLOW, ENODEV: Error macros returned by the function. Include to find their definitions (no memcmp relevance themselves) so the analyzer has the complete context of return values and any macros that might expand to functions using memcmp.\n- __func__: Standard predefined identifier used in logging; include to ensure logging callsite resolution when tracing metal_log or any macros that expand to string-handling code.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementations of all called functions and the definitions/types of the structs/fields used by the target, and search for memcmp uses (symbol memcmp) in that reachable code to determine whether any memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings in the target's call scope."
