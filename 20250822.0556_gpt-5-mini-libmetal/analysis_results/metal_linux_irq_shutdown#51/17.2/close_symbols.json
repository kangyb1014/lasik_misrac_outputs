  "explanation": "To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion you must inspect every function called (transitively) by metal_linux_irq_shutdown to ensure none of them (directly or via other callees) call back to metal_linux_irq_shutdown. Each listed symbol is therefore required:\n\n- metal_linux_irq_notify: Direct callee of metal_linux_irq_shutdown; its body (and any callees it invokes) must be checked to ensure it does not call back to metal_linux_irq_shutdown (forming an indirect recursion).\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Direct callee; its implementation must be checked for any call chains that could lead back to metal_linux_irq_shutdown.\n\n- metal_log: Called from metal_linux_irq_shutdown for logging; although unlikely, its implementation (or functions it calls) must be inspected to ensure no path leads back to metal_linux_irq_shutdown.\n\n- pthread_join: Called by metal_linux_irq_shutdown; while pthread_join itself is a library/OS function, you must consider interactions with the thread being joined. pthread_join can synchronize with another thread that might call metal_linux_irq_shutdown, so its use requires inspecting the thread start routine to rule out indirect recursion via the joined thread.\n\n- close: Called by metal_linux_irq_shutdown; include it to verify it (or functions it calls) does not lead back to metal_linux_irq_shutdown.\n\n- IRQ thread start routine (the function passed to pthread_create for irq_pthread): The thread function that runs in irq_pthread must be checked because that thread could call metal_linux_irq_shutdown; if so, metal_linux_irq_shutdown calling pthread_join on that thread could create an indirect recursive call path (thread A calls shutdown -> shutdown joins thread B -> thread B calls shutdown -> ...). Even though this is cross-thread, it is still an indirect call relationship relevant to the MISRA recursion rule.\n\nOnly by examining these symbols (and any functions they in turn call) can you determine whether there exists any call path from metal_linux_irq_shutdown back to itself (directly or indirectly)."
