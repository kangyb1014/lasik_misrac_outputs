  "explanation": "I inspected all controlling expressions in the provided code. The only conditional statements are:\n- if (ret) in metal_linux_irq_shutdown \u2014 ret is assigned from pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL) immediately beforehand, so the controlling expression depends on the runtime return value of pthread_join and is not invariant.\n- if (ret < 0) in metal_linux_irq_notify \u2014 ret is assigned from write(irq_notify_fd, &val, sizeof(val)), so the controlling expression depends on the runtime return value of write and is not invariant.\nThere are no loops (while, for, do-while) or switch statements with constant/invariant controlling expressions in the provided snippets. The assignment irq_handling_stop = true is not a controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and nothing needs to be flagged for further investigation."
