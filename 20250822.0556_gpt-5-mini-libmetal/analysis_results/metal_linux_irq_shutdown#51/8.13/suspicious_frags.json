  "explanation": "Only the metal_log call is flagged because it passes __func__ (an array that decays to a char * in the call) into a variadic logging function; this should be investigated to confirm whether the formal parameter/prototype treats the argument as const char * (per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13) or incorrectly uses a non-const pointer type. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL) passes NULL for the second parameter (no non-const pointer usage to revise), close(irq_notify_fd) and the integer/boolean variables (ret, irq_notify_fd, irq_handling_stop) do not involve pointer-to-data that could/should be const, metal_linux_irq_notify() is called with no pointer argument, and metal_mutex_deinit(&irq_lock) takes a pointer to an object that is expected to be modified by deinitialization (so a non-const parameter is appropriate)."
