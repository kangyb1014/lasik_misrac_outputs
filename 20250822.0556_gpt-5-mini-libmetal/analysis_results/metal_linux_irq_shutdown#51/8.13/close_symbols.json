  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified where possible you must examine every pointer usage and function parameter type/qualification that appears (or is implied) in metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\n\n- metal_log (prototype): to know the exact parameter types (e.g. whether the format parameter is declared as const char * or char *). Passing __func__ or other string arguments involves pointer-to-char types; the prototype shows whether const qualification is already used.\n\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG, METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum definitions): to confirm these are integer-level constants (not pointer types). This rules out pointer-related issues coming from the log-level arguments.\n\n- __func__ (builtin identifier/type): __func__ is defined as a char array (char[N]) by the C standard; knowing this ensures correct interpretation when it is passed to a function expecting const char * vs char * and whether a const qualification would be appropriate.\n\n- irq_handling_stop (declaration and type/qualifiers): to confirm this is a non-pointer scalar (e.g. bool/volatile) so it is not a pointer misqualification issue. Its qualifiers (volatile/const) may also be relevant to MISRA checks.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_notify (prototype): to confirm it takes no pointer parameters (or to inspect any pointer parameters and their const-qualification) because the call here could expose pointer constness issues in the callee's prototype.\n\n- pthread_join (prototype) and pthread_t (typedef): pthread_join has a pointer parameter (void **retval). Knowing its exact prototype is necessary to decide if passing NULL here is appropriate and whether the parameter type should be const-qualified (it should not be const since pthread_join writes through it). The pthread_t typedef is needed to examine irq_pthread type.\n\n- irq_pthread (declaration and type): to know the type passed to pthread_join (pthread_t) and confirm it is not a pointer that might require a const qualification.\n\n- close (prototype): to confirm it takes an int (no pointer) and therefore that call is not relevant to pointer constness issues.\n\n- irq_notify_fd (declaration and type): to confirm it is an int file descriptor (not a pointer) so no const-pointer issue arises here.\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit (prototype): to inspect the parameter type (likely a pointer to a mutex type). The prototype shows whether the API already expects a pointer to non-const (appropriate if it modifies the mutex) or erroneously takes a non-const pointer when a const pointer would suffice.\n\n- irq_lock (declaration and type/definition of metal_mutex_t / struct metal_mutex): required because &irq_lock is passed to metal_mutex_deinit; you must know whether irq_lock is an object or pointer, and the details of metal_mutex_t/struct metal_mutex determine whether deinit legitimately needs a non-const pointer or could accept a pointer-to-const.\n\nCollectively these symbols let you (a) identify every pointer passed or implicitly used in the function, (b) see the declared const-qualification (or lack thereof) for those pointer parameters, and (c) decide if any non-const pointer could/should be declared const in accordance with the MISRA rule."
