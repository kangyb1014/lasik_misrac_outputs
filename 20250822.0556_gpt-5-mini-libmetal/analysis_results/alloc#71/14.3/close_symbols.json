  "explanation": "metal_allocate_memory: You must inspect its declaration/implementation and semantics to know whether it can legitimately return NULL (or always returns a non-NULL/constant pointer). The MISRA rule depends on whether the controlling expression (!ptr) can vary at run time or is invariant because this call always returns the same value.\n\nmetal_log: Determine whether this function (or macro) can affect control flow (for example be annotated noreturn, perform longjmp/exit, or otherwise make the if-branch non-returning). If the logging call is non-returning or changes program flow, that affects reachability and whether the controlling expression must be considered invariant.\n\nMETAL_LOG_DEBUG: This macro/constant can affect how metal_log is used (it might expand to something that alters behavior in some builds). Knowing its definition ensures the call/argument to metal_log does not change control-flow semantics relevant to the if expression.\n\nenoerrno: The code returns errno on failure; errno may be a macro (thread-local accessor) rather than a plain global. Its definition and side-effects (if any) are needed to understand whether evaluating it or the allocator can produce constant values that might indicate an invariant failure path. (Also useful to understand allocator error reporting semantics.)\n\nNULL: The controlling expression is a pointer test (!ptr). Knowing how NULL is defined on the target (0, (void *)0, etc.) is necessary to reason about pointer-to-zero comparisons and whether a compile-time constant pointer could compare equal to NULL in this environment."
