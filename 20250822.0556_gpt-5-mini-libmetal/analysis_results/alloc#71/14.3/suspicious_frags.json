  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant constants and thus none require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- The if (!ptr) in alloc() depends on the result of metal_allocate_memory(1000), so it is not an invariant.\n- The macro-defined if inside metal_log (if(_metal.common.log_handler && level <= _metal.common.log_level) ...) depends on global state and the level parameter, so it is not an invariant either. Although the macro uses a GCC statement-expression ({ ... }), that is a language-extension issue but does not create an invariant controlling expression.\n- There are no loop constructs in the provided code whose controlling expressions could be constant (no for/while/do-while present to consider the exceptions for infinite loops or constant do-while false).\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that violate Rule 14.3 or that need further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
