  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not appear to be candidates for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code):\n- The local declaration \"void *ptr;\" is required to hold the allocation result and is not executable dead code.\n- The if (!ptr) { metal_log(...); return errno; } block implements error handling and logging on allocation failure; this is executable and has observable effects (log handler call and a non-zero return), so it is not dead. The metal_log macro may invoke a user-provided log handler and thus has side effects.\n- The return 0; at the end indicates successful completion of the function and is observable to callers.\n- The provided metal_log macro definition (in the additional code) conditionally calls a log handler and therefore is not dead code by itself.\n\nThe two reported fragments (allocation and immediate free) should be investigated because an allocation followed immediately by a free without using the memory is a common pattern that can be dead (its removal might not change program behaviour) unless the allocation/free have required side effects (e.g. testing allocator, timing, or modifying global state). Other lines implement necessary control flow or observable behaviour and thus do not need investigation under Rule 2.2."
