  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of alloc:\n```c\nstatic int alloc(void)\n{\n\tvoid *ptr;\n\n\tptr = metal_allocate_memory(1000);\n\tif (!ptr) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"failed to allocate memory\\n\");\n\t\treturn errno;\n\t}\n\n\tmetal_free_memory(ptr);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function alloc:\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nptr = metal_allocate_memory(1000);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment is not dead in the given context. The result of metal_allocate_memory(1000) is tested (if (!ptr) ...) and thus affects control flow and observable behaviour (failure path returns errno and logs). Additionally, allocation/free have observable side-effects (heap state, timing) so removing the call could change program behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. (Hypothetical violating scenario: if metal_allocate_memory were known to always succeed, have no side-effects, metal_free_memory were a no-op, and errno and timing were unaffected, then this allocation+free would be dead code \u2014 but that is not the case from the shown code.)"
