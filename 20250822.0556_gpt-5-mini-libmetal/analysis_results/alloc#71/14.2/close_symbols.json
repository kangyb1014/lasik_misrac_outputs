The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_allocate_memory: The call may be a macro or inline function. If it expands inline into alloc (e.g. a macro) it could introduce a for loop into alloc's body; if it is a function called from inside a for loop its internal behaviour (loops, side-effects) must be examined because the MISRA rule counts the behaviour of called functions as part of the for-loop body.\\n- metal_free_memory: Same rationale as metal_allocate_memory \u2014 it might be a macro/inline or contain for loops/side-effects that affect conformance when called from a for loop.\\n- metal_log: This call is present in the error path and could be a macro or inline that expands into loop constructs or has side-effects; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not inject or perform disallowed modifications relevant to for-loop well-formedness.\\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: This macro (or constant) could expand to an expression with side-effects or be defined in a way that affects the code emitted for alloc (e.g. conditional macros). Its definition is needed to see whether its expansion introduces loops or side-effects relevant to the MISRA rule.\\n- errno: errno is often a macro that may expand to an expression or function call (thread-local accessor). Its definition must be checked because a macro expansion could include additional expressions or function calls (and thus possible side-effects or loops) which could affect whether a surrounding for loop is well-formed.\\n\nNote: alloc itself contains no for statement; these symbols are required only to rule out the possibility that macro expansions or the behaviour of called functions introduce for statements or side-effects that would make a for loop (if present) ill-formed under the MISRA rule."
