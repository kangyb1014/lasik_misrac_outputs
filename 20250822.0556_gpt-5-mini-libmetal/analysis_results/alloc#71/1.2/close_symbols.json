  "explanation": "metal_log: The function is called from alloc; its declaration/definition must be inspected to detect use of compiler language extensions (e.g. GCC __attribute__, inline assembly, compiler-specific calling conventions, variadic/format macros or nonstandard qualifiers). METAL_LOG_DEBUG: This identifier is used as a logging level/macro. If it is a macro (or expands to an expression) it may use preprocessor or compiler extensions (token-pasting, statement-expressions, typeof, GCC extension macros). errno: The code returns errno; errno is commonly implemented as a macro that can expand to thread-local accessors or compiler-specific helpers (e.g. __errno_location(), __thread, or __declspec(thread)). Its definition must be checked for use of language extensions. <errno.h>: The header where errno (and related supporting macros/types) is declared \u2014 inspect this header to see whether errno or other constructs rely on compiler extensions. metal_allocate_memory (declaration/definition): Although present in the call graph, its prototype/definition must be checked for use of language extensions in its declaration (attributes, nonstandard types, calling conventions) or inlined implementation. metal_free_memory (declaration/definition): Same reason as metal_allocate_memory \u2014 check its declaration/definition for any compiler-specific extensions that would make alloc use language extensions indirectly."
