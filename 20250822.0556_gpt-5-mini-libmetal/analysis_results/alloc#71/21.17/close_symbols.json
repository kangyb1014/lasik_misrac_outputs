  "explanation": "To decide if alloc violates the MISRA <string.h> rule we must inspect any called code that might use standard string functions (directly or indirectly).\n- metal_allocate_memory: its implementation/definition is required to see whether it calls any of the string.h functions (or returns a pointer that leads to later string ops). If it uses memcpy/strcpy/etc., that could create a violation.\n- metal_free_memory: its implementation is needed to check for any hidden use of string.h functions or buffer accesses when freeing/cleanup occurs.\n- metal_log: logging implementations commonly format or manipulate strings; we must inspect metal_log to determine whether it calls any of the string.h functions listed below (e.g., strlen, strcpy, strcat) that could perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: the macro/enum controls the logging path; its definition is needed to know which metal_log code path is taken (some paths may invoke different formatting routines that use string.h functions).\n- errno: the variable/symbol is returned on error; include its declaration to ensure the error path is correctly modeled (even though errno itself is not a string function, it is part of the failure path that leads to metal_log).\n- memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn: these standard <string.h> symbols must be checked in the transitive callees (metal_allocate_memory, metal_free_memory, metal_log and any of their callees). The MISRA rule applies specifically to these functions, so their presence/usage and the buffer sizes/arguments in those implementations are the primary concern."
