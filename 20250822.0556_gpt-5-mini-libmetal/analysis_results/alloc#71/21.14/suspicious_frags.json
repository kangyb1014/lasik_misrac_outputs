  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function alloc and the related macro definition. There is no use of memcmp or any other raw memory-comparison of strings in the alloc function or in the metal_log macro expansion shown. The only string literal appears in the metal_log call, but that is passed to metal_fmt and a log handler \u2014 neither of which is defined here and no memcmp call is present in the provided fragments. There are also no calls that pass C strings into memcmp-like operations in the shown code. Therefore, based on the supplied code and macro, there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and nothing here needs further investigation for memcmp-on-null-terminated-strings. (If metal_fmt or the log handler implementations \u2014 not provided \u2014 use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, those implementations would need review; they are outside the supplied fragments.)"
