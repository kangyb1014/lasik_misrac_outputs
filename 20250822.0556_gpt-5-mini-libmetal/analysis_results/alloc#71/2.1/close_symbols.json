  "explanation": "- metal_allocate_memory: need its prototype and any attributes/contract (e.g., guaranteed non-NULL, may return NULL, __attribute__((noreturn)), may longjmp/exit). Whether it can ever return NULL or can fail non-locally directly determines reachability of both the if (!ptr) branch and the code after the allocation.\n- metal_free_memory: need its prototype and attributes (could it be __attribute__((noreturn)) or perform non-local exit?). If it does not return or otherwise prevents following code, that changes which statements are reachable.\n- metal_log: although not listed in the provided call graph, the function is called in the if-branch. Its prototype/attributes are needed to know whether calling it can terminate the program (noreturn/exit/longjmp) which would make subsequent statements unreachable.\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: the logging macro/constant may expand to an expression or trigger different behavior in metal_log; include its definition to ensure the log call does not alter control flow semantics (rare, but relevant for unreachable-code analysis).\n- errno: needed to confirm that returning errno is valid code (its declaration/definition) and whether its access has any side effects that could affect reachability reasoning.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations and any compiler attributes/annotations) lets an analyzer determine whether each branch and subsequent statements in alloc are actually reachable or are unreachable code."
