  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer is used to hold the address returned by metal_allocate_memory and is later passed to metal_free_memory which (by its typical API) expects a void *; declaring 'const void *ptr' would force a cast when calling metal_free_memory. Because the pointer must be passed to a non-const API and is not merely used for read-only access in this function, making it const is not practical here. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated in this fragment."
