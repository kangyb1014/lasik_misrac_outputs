  "explanation": "Only code that declares or uses a non-const pointer type is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The remaining lines (the function signature and braces, the null check \"if (!ptr) { ... }\", the logging call \"metal_log(...)\", and the return statements) do not introduce pointer declarations or pointer-to-non-const conversions and therefore are not relevant for investigation under Rule 8.13."
