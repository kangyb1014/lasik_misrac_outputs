  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) is a macro-based iterator and is expected to expand to a loop whose controlling expression depends on ldrv/list state (i.e. not invariant). If the macro did expand to an infinite loop (e.g. for(;;) or for(; true;)), that would still be permitted by the Rule 14.3 exception for intentional infinite loops. The only real violation would be if the macro expanded to a loop whose controlling expression is a compile-time or otherwise invariant constant that is not an intended infinite loop; that is not the case here."
