  "explanation": "All other lines in the function are declarations, assignments and function calls (e.g. struct declarations, sysfs_close_driver(...), ldrv->sdrv = NULL; sysfs_close_bus(...), lbus->sbus = NULL;). These do not contain controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. No do-while loops or other control constructs are present beyond the two items listed above, so there are no additional controlling expressions to inspect for invariance."
