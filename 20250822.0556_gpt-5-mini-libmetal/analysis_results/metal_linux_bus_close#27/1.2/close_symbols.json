  "explanation": "You must inspect the following symbols because the MISRA check is specifically about use of compiler/language extensions (e.g. GCC typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__(), nested functions, inline asm, zero-length arrays as an extension, etc.). For each symbol below I explain why it is needed to determine whether the target function uses an extension:\n\n- for_each_linux_driver\n  - This is a macro used directly in the loop. Macros that iterate collections in kernel code commonly expand to other macros that may use extensions (typeof, statement-expression blocks, non-standard comma expressions). You must see its definition to detect any such extensions.\n\n- list_for_each_entry (or the underlying list-iteration macro used by for_each_linux_driver)\n  - The for_each_linux_driver macro frequently wraps a general list-iteration macro (e.g. list_for_each_entry). Those iteration macros in many codebases use typeof or GCC-specific tricks; inspect the exact macro expanded to confirm whether an extension is used.\n\n- container_of (or any helper used by to_linux_bus / the iteration macros)\n  - container_of and similar helpers often rely on typeof or pointer arithmetic macros. If for_each_linux_driver or to_linux_bus uses container_of, you must inspect its definition to check for compiler extensions.\n\n- to_linux_bus\n  - to_linux_bus is called at the start; it may be a cast macro or an inline function. If it is a macro, it may use extensions (e.g. typeof, statement-expressions, or compiler attributes). If it is an inline function, check for GCC attributes or nonstandard inline semantics.\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - The loop iterates drivers via a field of linux_bus and later accesses lbus->sbus. You need the struct layout to see whether any fields are defined using nonstandard constructs (e.g. zero-length arrays, compiler-specific bit-field ordering pragmas, or attributes on fields).\n\n- struct linux_driver\n  - The loop variable ldrv and its sdrv member are used. Inspecting the struct definition is required to detect any use of compiler extensions in field declarations (attributes, unusual bitfields) or nonstandard language constructs embedded in the type.\n\n- struct metal_bus\n  - to_linux_bus takes struct metal_bus *; the definition may include macros or attributes that are language extensions. Confirming the declaration is needed to ensure no extensions are used in type conversion or casting macros.\n\n- sysfs_close_driver\n  - This is invoked inside the loop. It could be a macro (potentially using extensions) or a function with compiler-specific attributes. Inspect its declaration/definition to rule out extensions.\n\n- sysfs_close_bus\n  - Called at the end and assigned lbus->sbus = NULL. As above, it may be a macro or have attributes; its definition must be checked for extensions.\n\nSummary: inspect the macro definitions and struct/type declarations listed above (particularly for_each_linux_driver, its underlying list macros, container_of, and to_linux_bus) to determine whether the target function relies on language/compiler extensions (typeof, statement-expressions, __attribute__, inline asm, nested functions, etc.)."
