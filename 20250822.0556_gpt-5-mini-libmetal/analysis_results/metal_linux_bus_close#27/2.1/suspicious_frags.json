  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function is provably unreachable at compile time. There are no early returns, goto jumps, constant false conditions, or code after unconditional control-flow exits that would make any statement unreachable. The assignments and calls (to_linux_bus, the for_each_linux_driver loop body, sysfs_close_bus, and the subsequent NULL assignments) can all be executed depending on runtime state and are not syntactically or semantically guaranteed to never execute. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) in this snippet."
