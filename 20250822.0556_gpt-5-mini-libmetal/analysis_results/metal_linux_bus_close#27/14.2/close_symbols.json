Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "for_each_linux_driver: This macro/inline controls the for loop structure. To determine if the for statement is well-formed under MISRA C you must see its expansion (initialization, test, iteration expressions) to identify the loop counter, any control flag, and any persistent side effects in the second clause. to_linux_bus: The call produces the lbus value used by the iterator; its implementation may have side effects or change which objects the iterator uses. struct linux_bus: The iterator almost certainly walks a field inside linux_bus (e.g. a driver list or pointer). You must inspect the bus layout to see which objects the loop control expression reads and whether any of those are modified in the loop body. struct linux_driver: The loop variable ldrv is this type; its definition shows the sdrv member that is modified in the body and may reveal other members referenced by the iterator macros. sysfs_close_driver: This function is called inside the loop body. MISRA requires considering the behaviour of any called functions within the loop body to check whether they have side effects that modify the loop counter, loop control flag, or any object used by the loop control expressions. sysfs_close_bus: Although called after the loop, its prototype/implementation should be checked for side effects on objects used by the iterator (for completeness) to ensure no interaction with the loop control objects. These symbols together let an analyst expand the for loop, identify the loop counter/control flag, and verify that only the loop counter is modified (and only in the third clause) and that the second clause has no persistent side effects as required by the MISRA rule."
