  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in metal_linux_irq_notify (signature: void). The code only modifies local variables (val and ret) and calls write with irq_notify_fd and the address of a local variable (&val). Passing &val to write does not modify a function parameter in this function; write\u2019s parameters are part of an external library call and the pointer argument points to a local object, not to a function parameter of metal_linux_irq_notify. There is no assignment to any function parameter (none exist), and no pointer parameter of this function is modified. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
