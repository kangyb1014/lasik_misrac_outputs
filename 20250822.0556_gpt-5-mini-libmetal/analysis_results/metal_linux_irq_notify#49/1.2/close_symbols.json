  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- irq_notify_fd (declaration and type): The target function uses this global. Its declaration may include compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (for example __attribute__ annotations, nonstandard qualifiers, or compiler-specific linkage) that are language extensions. To decide if the code uses a language extension you must inspect irq_notify_fd's declaration.\n\n- write (prototype/declaring header): write is a POSIX API (not in standard C). Determining whether its use constitutes a language extension for the build requires the prototype and where it is declared (e.g., <unistd.h>) and whether that header/usage is considered an extension in the current compilation mode.\n\n- uint64_t (typedef / header where defined): Fixed-width integer types come from C99 <stdint.h> or from vendor-provided headers. You need to know whether uint64_t is coming from a standard header (C99) or from a nonstandard/vendor extension to conclude if the code relies on a language extension.\n\n- metal_log (prototype/definition): The logging function could be declared using compiler-specific extensions (variadic macros, GCC format attributes, __attribute__ annotations, or nonstandard parameter types). Its declaration/definition is needed to see whether the function call uses any nonstandard language extensions.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum definition): This macro/constant may itself be defined using compiler extensions (complex macros, token-pasting with nonstandard behavior, etc.). Inspecting its definition is required to detect extension usage.\n\n- __func__ (compiler-provided identifier behavior): __func__ is standard in C99 but some compilers provide it only as an extension in older modes (or provide alternative extension names). You must know how the compiler treats __func__ under the project build flags to decide whether its use is a language extension.\n\n- translation-unit include list (headers included by this .c file): Knowing the actual headers pulled into this TU (and their contents) is necessary because inclusion of nonstandard headers or header-provided macros/types could introduce language extensions.\n\n- declarations of irq_notify_fd and metal_log including any attributes/macros: A focused request for the exact declarations (including any attached attributes or macro expansions) is needed because those attributes/macros are common places where compiler-specific language extensions are used.\n\n- compiler language standard and compiler flags used to build this translation unit: Whether a construct is an \"extension\" depends on the chosen language standard and flags (for example -std=c99 versus -std=gnu99 or compiling in C89 mode). The build flags are therefore required to judge if any used construct is a language extension as per the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols/data will allow the next analyst to determine whether any identifiers, types, headers or declarations used by metal_linux_irq_notify rely on compiler- or platform-specific language extensions that must be reported under the MISRA rule."
