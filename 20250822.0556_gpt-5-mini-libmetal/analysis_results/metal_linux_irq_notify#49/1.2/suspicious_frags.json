  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided fragment. Specifically:\n- uint64_t is a standard fixed-width integer type from <stdint.h> (C99), not a compiler extension.\n- __func__ is the standardized predefined identifier (C99), not a compiler-specific extension.\n- The write() call is a POSIX library function (not a compiler language extension); its use is a library/API choice, not a language extension as defined by compiler documentation.\n- There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({: ... }), nested functions, designated initializer extensions, or GCC/Clang-specific pragmas in this fragment.\n\nNote: Definitions outside this fragment (e.g. the implementations/macros of metal_log or the declaration of irq_notify_fd) are not visible here; if those hidden definitions use compiler-specific extensions, they would need to be inspected. Based solely on the code shown, no language extensions requiring reporting under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 are present."
