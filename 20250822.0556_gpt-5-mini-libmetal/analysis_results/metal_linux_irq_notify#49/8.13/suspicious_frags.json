  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns use of pointers to non-const objects where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate. The only places in this function that create or use such pointers are the definition of the local buffer 'uint64_t val = 1;' and the call that takes its address and passes it to write(). Other fragments do not involve creating or passing pointers that should be const-qualified: 'int ret;' is a plain integer, the return statement returns an int, the error logging call uses strings and formatting but no non-const pointer-to-object passed where a const-qualified pointer is expected, and sizeof(val) yields a size_t. Therefore no other lines need investigation for Rule 8.13."
