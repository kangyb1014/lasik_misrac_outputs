  "scenario": "The code passes &val where val is declared as a non-const uint64_t, so the pointer expression has type uint64_t * (a pointer to a non-const object). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible; here val is never modified after initialization and could be declared const. This is a violation. Fix: declare val as const uint64_t val = 1; so &val is a pointer-to-const and matches the intent of the rule."
