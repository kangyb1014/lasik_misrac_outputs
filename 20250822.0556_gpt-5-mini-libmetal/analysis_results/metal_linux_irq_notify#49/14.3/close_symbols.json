  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression if (ret < 0) is invariant you must know whether 'ret' can vary at run time. ret is assigned from write(irq_notify_fd, &val, sizeof(val)), so you need: \n\n- irq_notify_fd: its declaration, type, initial value and all places it is modified (is it a compile\u2011time constant, a static file variable, volatile, or changed by other functions). If irq_notify_fd is constant or never changes, write may always observe the same target and produce the same return value making the condition invariant.\n\n- write: the actual implementation/prototype used in this build (POSIX syscall or project wrapper). You must know its possible return values and whether its result can vary with runtime/OS state (e.g., blocking, interrupted, EPIPE, closed FD). If write is a stub that always returns the same value, the condition could be invariant.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_set_enable: this caller appears in the static call graph and likely changes IRQ state. Its definition may modify irq_notify_fd or the environment that affects write's result; inspect it to see whether it makes ret variant.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_shutdown: this caller likely closes or changes irq_notify_fd; its definition is needed to determine if/when the fd becomes invalid or constant, affecting write's return value and therefore the condition.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire and metal_mutex_release: these synchronization primitives appear in the caller call graph (metal_linux_irq_set_enable). Their implementations and use sites determine whether updates to irq_notify_fd (or other shared state that affects write) are synchronized or can change concurrently \u2014 relevant to whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant in a single-threaded or race-prone context.\n\n- definition/location where irq_notify_fd is opened/initialized/closed: if this is in a separate init/shutdown routine, you need that code to know the lifecycle of the fd and whether write will observe different states across calls.\n\nCollecting these symbols and their definitions lets the analyzer determine whether ret (and thus the controlling expression ret < 0) can change at runtime or is effectively invariant, which is the information required to assess the MISRA C rule."
