Other agents can not investigate other fragments that you do not report, so it is very important to find all suspicious fragments without missing any.

  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The only use of a string-handling function in this routine is the call to strlen shown above; therefore only fragments containing that call should be investigated. The remaining statements (assigning device->bus and the call to metal_list_add_tail) do not call any <string.h> functions and are not relevant to Rule 21.17, so they do not need further investigation under this rule."
