Example violation: device->name points to a fixed-size buffer char buf[4] that is filled completely with non\u2011zero bytes (no '\\0' present); calling strlen(device->name) will scan past buf into adjacent memory causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids uses of string.h functions that can read past the bounds of the object referenced by the pointer argument. The code calls strlen(device->name) after only checking device->name != NULL; it does not guarantee that the object pointed to by device->name is null\u2011terminated within its allocated bounds. If device->name points to a fixed\u2011size buffer that lacks a terminating '\\0' (or otherwise is not guaranteed to be NUL\u2011terminated), strlen may scan past the buffer and perform an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read, violating Rule 21.17. The call is therefore only compliant if there is an external, provable invariant that device->name always points to a NUL\u2011terminated array; absent that, this is a violation. Recommended fixes: ensure the name is always NUL\u2011terminated, or use a bounded alternative (e.g. strnlen with the known buffer size) and check the result before using it."
