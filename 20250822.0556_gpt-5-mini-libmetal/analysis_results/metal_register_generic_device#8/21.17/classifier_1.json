  "scenario": "Calling strlen(device->name) only checks for a non-NULL pointer but does not ensure the character array is null-terminated within its bounds. If device->name points to a char buffer that lacks a terminating '\\0' (or points into memory such that no '\\0' exists before the end of the object), strlen will read past the object\u2019s bounds, violating Rule 21.17."
