  "scenario": "Yes \u2014 strlen(device->name) can read beyond the bounds of the object if device->name is non-NULL but not guaranteed to point to a null\u2011terminated array within its allocated bounds. Example violation: device->name points to a fixed-size buffer char buf[4] that is filled completely with non\u2011zero bytes (no '\\0' present); calling strlen(device->name) will scan past buf into adjacent memory causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
