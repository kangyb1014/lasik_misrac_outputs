  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any memcmp-like raw byte comparison) exists in the provided function. The code only uses a pointer null check (!device->name), strlen(device->name) and integer comparisons; these do not invoke memcmp and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The null pointer check is performed before strlen via the || short-circuit, so strlen is not called on a NULL pointer. No other string comparisons (e.g. strcmp or memcmp) or byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings are present, so there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 21.14."
