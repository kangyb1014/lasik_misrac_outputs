  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The member device->bus is declared as a mutable pointer (struct metal_bus *), but it is being used to point at a shared, read-only bus descriptor (metal_generic_bus) that holds operation function pointers and is not intended to be modified per-device. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the API should express that intent by using a pointer-to-const (e.g. const struct metal_bus *bus) or by making the shared descriptor itself const. Note: this conclusion assumes there are no genuine writes through device->bus elsewhere in the code; if other code legitimately modifies the bus object via that pointer, then const would not be possible and there would be no violation. Given the provided snippets, using a const-qualified pointer is possible and therefore the rule is violated."
