  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the snippets provided. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is a \u201cshould\u201d recommending that pointers point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to object is not modified via that pointer. The target function metal_register_generic_device does not touch device->irq_info at all, so nothing in the shown code demonstrates that irq_info is only ever observed and never used to modify the pointed-to object. Declaring irq_info as void * rather than const void * could be intentional (the field might be used to store mutable state, to pass to APIs that modify the object, to hold an integer identifier via casting, or to preserve API compatibility). Without a full view of all uses of irq_info, you cannot conclude a violation of Rule 8.13. To determine whether a change is appropriate, review all uses of irq_info across the codebase; if it is never used to modify the pointee, then converting it to const void * would satisfy Rule 8.13 (or else document/justify the non-const declaration)."
