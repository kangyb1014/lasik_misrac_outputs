In the shown code the device->bus is only assigned to point at the global metal_generic_bus and there is no modification of the bus object via this pointer, so the pointer could be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const struct metal_bus *bus) to prevent unintended modification and satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to call a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 says a pointer type should be const-qualified when it does not need to be used to modify the pointed-to object. The snippet in metal_register_generic_device only assigns device->bus = &metal_generic_bus; and does not itself modify the bus object, but the rule applies to the declaration and all uses of device->bus across the code base, not just this one assignment. The provided additional code shows the member is declared as struct metal_bus *bus; and a global mutable metal_generic_bus exists, but there is no proof that device->bus is never used to perform mutable operations on the bus elsewhere. Converting the member to const struct metal_bus *bus would be harmless for this function (assigning &metal_generic_bus to a pointer-to-const is permitted), but could break other code that expects a non-const pointer (for example, code that modifies bus state or calls APIs taking struct metal_bus *). Because the reporter did not demonstrate that device->bus is never used to modify the bus (or that all uses can accept a const pointer), the claim of a MISRA 8.13 violation is not substantiated. Therefore the report is not correct."
