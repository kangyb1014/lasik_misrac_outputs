  "explanation": "The rest of the code contains no other function calls that could produce direct or indirect recursion. Specifically: the checks of device->name and device->num_regions are simple pointer/field accesses and comparisons; METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS and EINVAL are compile-time macros/constants; the assignment device->bus = &metal_generic_bus; and the return statements do not invoke functions. Therefore only the two function-call expressions listed above need investigation for possible indirect recursion."
