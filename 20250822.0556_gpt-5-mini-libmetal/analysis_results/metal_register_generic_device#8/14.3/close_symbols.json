  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression in the if-statement is invariant you must know whether each subexpression can vary at run time. Specifically:\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): required to know the exact types of device->name and device->num_regions and any const/volatile qualifiers. If num_regions or name are declared const or otherwise fixed in the struct/type, the expression might be invariant.\n\n- device->name (declaration/initialization sites / any static initializers): the test uses !device->name and strlen(device->name). If name is always NULL or always points to a fixed, compile-time constant empty string for all instances passed here, the expression could be invariant. You need the places where device instances are defined/initialized to determine that.\n\n- device->num_regions (type and qualifiers / initialization sites): the comparison device->num_regions > METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS can only be judged non\u2011invariant if num_regions can change or differ between instances/calls. The field's type and any initialization sites (or const qualifiers) are necessary.\n\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro / compile-time value): you must know its compile-time value to evaluate whether the comparison could be constant for the possible num_regions values.\n\n- strlen (declaration/semantics): know whether strlen is the standard runtime function (returns length at run time) or replaced by a macro/compile-time evaluated routine in this build. If strlen were a compile-time constant-expression substitute, that could affect invariance.\n\n- All call sites that pass the 'device' argument to metal_register_generic_device: MISRA invariance is concerned with whether the controlling expression can be invariant in actual use. To determine that you must inspect every place this function is invoked (and how the metal_device instances are created/initialized) to see if the tested fields are ever variable. (The static call graph here shows no callers; if there are external callers or static instances they must be examined.)\n\nOther symbols in the function (metal_generic_bus, metal_list_add_tail, _metal.common.generic_device_list, EINVAL) do not affect whether the if controlling expression is invariant and therefore are not required for this specific MISRA C rule check."
