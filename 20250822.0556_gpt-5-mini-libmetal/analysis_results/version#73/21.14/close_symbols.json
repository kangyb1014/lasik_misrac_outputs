  "explanation": "For deciding whether the function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp on null-terminated strings you must know whether any string comparisons in version() ultimately use memcmp or compare non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffers. The following symbols are required with their definitions/implementations/prototypes:\n\n- strcmp: Determine whether the strcmp called here is the standard library function or a macro/alias that expands to or calls memcmp (if strcmp is implemented as a direct memcmp wrapper that would trigger the MISRA concern).\n- memcmp: Inspect the memcmp implementation or presence to see if any of the comparison functions (strcmp or library helpers) are implemented in terms of memcmp, and to detect direct uses elsewhere.\n- snprintf: Validate whether snprintf used to build ver_def/ver_dyn guarantees NUL termination on the target platform and when truncation occurs (C standard guarantees this for size>0, but the platform implementation must be confirmed), because non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffers could change whether a memcmp-based compare would be inappropriate.\n- METAL_VER: Definition of this macro/constant is needed to confirm it is a NUL\u2011terminated string (type and storage) so that strcmp(ver_def, METAL_VER) is a proper NUL-terminated string comparison and not a raw buffer comparison.\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH: Their definitions show whether they are integer macros (as expected) or something else that could affect the formatted strings produced by snprintf.\n- metal_ver: Implementation or prototype to confirm it returns a NUL\u2011terminated C string (const char *) and to check whether its implementation uses memcmp internally or returns a pointer into a buffer that may not be NUL\u2011terminated.\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch: Implementations/prototypes to confirm they return integers (as assumed) and do not perform hidden string comparisons or side effects (not likely, but required for completeness).\n\nWith these symbols and their definitions/implementations you can determine (a) whether strcmp here expands to or calls memcmp (which would implicate the MISRA rule), and (b) whether the operands passed to strcmp are guaranteed to be NUL\u2011terminated strings (if they are not, different rules/UB apply)."
