  "explanation": "snprintf \u2014 need the exact semantic (prototype and standard behavior) to know that it will (a) not write more than the provided buffer size, (b) whether it guarantees null-termination when size>0, and (c) its return value semantics (number of characters that would have been written). These points determine whether ver_def/ver_dyn can be left unterminated or overflowed (the central concern of the MISRA rule).\n\nstrcmp \u2014 need the exact semantic (reads each operand until a terminating NUL) to judge whether it can access beyond the bounds of either operand; this requires knowing that both compared strings are NUL-terminated within their object bounds.\n\nMETAL_VER \u2014 the macro/string literal compared against ver_def; its type/content and length are required to determine whether strcmp will traverse beyond ver_def (or whether mismatch/truncation matters for safety analysis).\n\nMETAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH \u2014 the macro integer definitions used to build ver_def. Their values (or at least ranges/limits) are required to compute the maximum formatted length produced by the \"%d.%d.%d\" format and thus whether snprintf could attempt to write more characters than ver_def/ver_dyn can hold.\n\nmetal_ver_major(), metal_ver_minor(), metal_ver_patch() \u2014 prototypes/return types and value ranges are required to ensure the functions return an int suitable for \"%d\" (no format/argument type mismatch UB) and to compute the maximum produced digits so as to bound the formatted string length.\n\nmetal_ver() \u2014 prototype/return type and the guarantee that it returns a NUL-terminated string (and its maximum length) are required: strcmp reads until a NUL, so we must ensure metal_ver() provides a valid NUL-terminated object and that comparing it against ver_dyn will not cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n(These symbols together let an analyzer determine: whether the formatted strings can exceed the 16-byte buffers, whether snprintf behavior guarantees termination, and whether strcmp can legally scan both operands without accessing memory beyond the referenced objects.)"
