  "explanation": "Other fragments in the provided code do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or produce data consumed by <string.h> functions in a way that could cause out-of-bounds access. Specifically:\n- The macro definitions (METAL_VER, METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH) are compile-time constant literals with known small content and do not perform any memory accesses.\n- The accessor functions (metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch) simply return those integer macros and do not perform any string operations or pointer arithmetic.\n- metal_ver() returns the string literal METAL_VER (an object with a null terminator under program storage), so it does not by itself cause out-of-bounds access when used as the second operand to strcmp.\n- No other calls to the Standard Library string functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the code.\nTherefore only the buffer declarations, the snprintf calls that populate those buffers, and the subsequent strcmp uses (all listed above) are relevant to investigating potential out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17."
