  "explanation": "Other parts of the provided snippet do not present reachable-code concerns beyond the flagged fragment. There are no conditional compilation blocks, no code placed after a return statement, no unreachable branch constructs (if/else/switch/loops) within the snippet, and all declared objects (ver_def, ver_dyn) are used prior to function exit. The format strings, buffer sizes, macro definitions and function-call expressions shown are ordinary runtime operations (they will be executed when the function is called) and therefore are not, by themselves, unreachable code. Consequently, no additional fragments in the supplied code need investigation for Rule 2.1 beyond the function shown above (for example the possibility that the static function is never referenced from elsewhere in the project should be checked at the project level)."
