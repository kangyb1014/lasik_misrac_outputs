  "suspicious_frags": [

  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining code does not introduce pointer objects that could/should be const-qualified: the arrays ver_def and ver_dyn are mutable buffers written by snprintf (so they cannot be declared const). The format string literals (\"%d.%d.%d\") are string literals used as const data and are not pointer variables that need qualification here. The numeric-returning helper functions (metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch) do not involve pointer types. The only places where pointer const-qualification might be relevant are the uses of METAL_VER and the return of metal_ver() when passed to strcmp, and the call building ver_dyn (snprintf writing into a non-const buffer) which could warrant checking the declared return type of metal_ver and the type of METAL_VER. No other fragments require investigation for Rule 8.13."
