  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided snippet. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function, fixed-size automatic char arrays, standard library functions (snprintf and strcmp), and preprocessor macros for version constants. There are no GCC/Clang extensions (no __attribute__, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, inline assembly, or nonstandard token pasting), no compiler-specific keywords, and no variable-length arrays or compound literals that would indicate an extension. The omitted headers (#include <stdio.h>, #include <string.h>) are not shown but their absence in the snippet does not prove use of an extension (implicit function declarations would be a concern only if the rest of the translation unit indeed calls undeclared functions; that cannot be determined from this fragment). Therefore no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
