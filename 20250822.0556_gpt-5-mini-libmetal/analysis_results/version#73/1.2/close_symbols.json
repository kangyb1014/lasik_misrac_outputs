  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check), the analyzer must inspect any symbols that can introduce non\u2011standard constructs into the function when expanded or called: \n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH: these macros are expanded into the arguments of snprintf. Their definitions must be checked for use of compiler extensions (e.g., GCC/clang typeof, statement expressions, binary/hex literal extensions, token\u2011pasting tricks, nonstandard suffixes, or other extension syntax).\n\n- METAL_VER: this macro is compared as a string constant. Its definition must be checked to ensure it is a standard C string literal or composed of only standard constructs and not using compiler extensions (e.g., attributes on string literals, nonstandard concatenation tricks, or extension macros).\n\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch, metal_ver (declarations/definitions): these called symbols may themselves be macros, inline functions, or functions annotated with compiler\u2011specific attributes or containing inline assembly or nested functions. The prototypes/definitions are needed to verify they use standard C declarations and definitions and do not employ language extensions (e.g., __attribute__, __declspec, nested functions, statement expressions, nonstandard calling conventions).\n\n- snprintf and strcmp (declarations/definitions / included headers): although standard library functions, their presence might be provided via compiler builtins, macros, or nonstandard headers in the translation unit. The declarations (and the headers included) should be checked to ensure they are the standard declarations and not replaced by nonstandard extensions or macros.\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro expansions and function declarations/definitions) is sufficient to decide whether any compiler language extensions are used by the target function as written or via the entities it expands/calls."
