  "explanation": "I found no controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, or do-while) in the provided code to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 would apply. The function version contains only variable declarations, two calls to snprintf, and a return expression that sums the results of strcmp calls \u2014 none of these are controlling expressions. The related definitions show constant macros and trivial accessor functions that return those constants, but none are used in a controlling expression in the supplied code. Therefore there are no invariant controlling expressions to investigate under Rule 14.3. Exceptions for infinite loops or do-while integer constant expressions are not applicable because no loops are present."
