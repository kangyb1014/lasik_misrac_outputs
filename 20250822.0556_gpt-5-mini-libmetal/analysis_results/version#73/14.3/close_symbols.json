  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/implementations of the above symbols to decide whether any controlling expression is (or can be) introduced into version() and therefore could be invariant. Rationale for each: \n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR / METAL_VER_MINOR / METAL_VER_PATCH: these macros/constants are used to form ver_def. Verify they are simple integer constants (or straightforward macros) and do not expand to conditional/controlling expressions (e.g. ternary, inline 'if' via macro) that would become part of version()'s controlling expressions. Also determine whether they are compile-time invariants. \n\n- METAL_VER: used as the right-hand string in strcmp(ver_def, METAL_VER). Confirm it is a static string literal or simple macro; if it expands to an expression containing a controlling operator it could introduce a controlling expression into version().\n\n- metal_ver_major / metal_ver_minor / metal_ver_patch: these calls build ver_dyn. Confirm whether they are normal functions (with possible varying return values) or macros/inline constants. If they are invariant (always return the same value) or macros that expand to controlling expressions, that affects whether any controlling expression in this translation unit would be invariant.\n\n- metal_ver: used as the right-hand string in strcmp(ver_dyn, metal_ver()). Confirm whether it is a function or macro, whether it can be evaluated to different values at runtime (so not invariant), and that it does not expand into controlling expressions when used here.\n\n- snprintf / strcmp: confirm these are the standard library functions (not project macros) and do not expand to macro bodies that contain control constructs. If either is a macro that introduces conditional/loop constructs into the version() expansion, that could create controlling expressions inside version().\n\nIn short, to prove compliance with MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' you need to see the actual macro definitions and function implementations (or prototypes/macros) for the listed symbols to ensure no controlling expressions are present in the expanded/compiled version() and that any controlling expressions (if present elsewhere) are not invariant."
