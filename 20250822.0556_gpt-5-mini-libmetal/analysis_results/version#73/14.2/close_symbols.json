The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function 'version' can violate the MISRA rule on well-formed for loops we must examine any code that contributes behaviour to 'version''s statements. Although 'version' contains no explicit for loops, the rule treats the behaviour of any functions called within a loop statement as part of the loop body; therefore any called function could contain ill-formed for loops. For each symbol:\n\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch: these are direct callees; their function bodies must be inspected for any for loops (or modifications to loop counters/flags) because such loops would contribute to 'version''s behaviour.\n- metal_ver: direct callee that returns the dynamic version string; its body must be checked for for loops or side-effecting code that would affect loop well-formedness when called from 'version'.\n- snprintf, strcmp: standard library calls invoked by 'version'; their implementations (or their usage assumptions) must be considered because any for loops in their bodies can be executed as part of 'version''s behaviour. If library implementations are treated as black-box but certified compliant, note that; otherwise their sources must be reviewed.\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH, METAL_VER: the macro/constant definitions must be examined to ensure they are simple constants and do not expand to expressions, function calls or constructs that contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags.\n\nIn short, to fully determine MISRA for-loop compliance as it pertains to 'version', inspect the bodies/definitions of all listed symbols (the four callees, the two library functions used, and the four macro definitions) so any for loops or forbidden side-effects are detected."
