  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided function. The code only uses memset and strncpy for memory and string copying, pointer assignments, malloc/free, and function-pointer calls (ldrv->dev_open / dev_close). There are no explicit string comparisons, nor any calls to memcmp or equivalent in this snippet.\n\nNote: the macro for_each_linux_driver and the bodies of the called functions (ldrv->dev_open, ldrv->dev_close) are not shown here; if they are defined elsewhere, they should be reviewed separately for any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Within the provided code fragment itself there are no instances that trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
