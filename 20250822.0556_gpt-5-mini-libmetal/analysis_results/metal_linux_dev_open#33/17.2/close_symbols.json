  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_open can call itself (directly or indirectly) we must inspect the functions it calls and any functions those callees may call back into. Explanation for each required symbol:\n\n- struct linux_driver\n  - Needed to know the types and names of the function-pointer fields (dev_open, dev_close) and how they are invoked; this lets us locate the actual functions that will run at the call sites in metal_linux_dev_open.\n\n- linux_driver::dev_open (concrete implementations)\n  - metal_linux_dev_open calls ldrv->dev_open. Any implementation assigned to this pointer may call back into metal_linux_dev_open (directly or through other functions). We must examine all concrete dev_open implementations present in the build to detect any recursion.\n\n- linux_driver::dev_close (concrete implementations)\n  - metal_linux_dev_open also calls ldrv->dev_close on error paths. Those implementations likewise may call metal_linux_dev_open (or call functions that do), so they must be analyzed.\n\n- for_each_linux_driver (macro/iterator implementation)\n  - Needed to understand how drivers are enumerated and which driver instances are actually invoked. The iterator implementation may trigger callbacks or side effects that could lead to indirect recursion.\n\n- to_linux_bus (implementation)\n  - This function is called at the top of metal_linux_dev_open; we must confirm that to_linux_bus does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_linux_dev_open.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (implementation)\n  - Called before returning success; check that it does not call metal_linux_dev_open (directly or indirectly).\n\n- linux bus driver registration symbols / lbus->driver list (places that register/populate drivers)\n  - To find the concrete dev_open/dev_close implementations you must find where drivers are registered (the driver instances stored in the bus). Those registration points reveal which functions are assigned to the linux_driver function pointers.\n\n- transitive callees of each dev_open/dev_close implementation (their call graphs)\n  - To detect indirect recursion you must analyze the full call chains starting from each dev_open/dev_close implementation (and any functions they call) to see whether any path leads back to metal_linux_dev_open.\n\nIn short: besides the two directly called functions already visible in the target, the safe MISRA C recursion analysis requires the linux_driver type and every concrete function assigned to its dev_open/dev_close pointers (and their transitive callees), plus the iterator/registration mechanisms that determine which implementations are invoked, and the implementations of the other direct callees (to_linux_bus, metal_list_add_tail) to ensure none of them lead back to metal_linux_dev_open."
