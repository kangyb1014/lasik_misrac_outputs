  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_open violates the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must be able to tell whether the function (or anything it invokes/macros it uses) assigns to any of its parameter variables (bus, dev_name, device) rather than only to objects they point to. The following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- struct metal_bus: shows layout of bus and the devices member; needed to assess effects of &bus->devices passed to metal_list_add_tail and whether any writes would be to the object pointed to (allowed) or to the parameter variable itself (disallowed).\n\n- struct metal_device: shows fields (name, node, bus) so we can determine what *device = &ldev->device and (*device)->name modify (the object pointed to by the parameter) and whether that is allowed by MISRA.\n\n- struct linux_bus: to understand what to_linux_bus returns and whether lbus aliases the incoming metal_bus pointer (aliasing could affect interpretation of subsequent operations).\n\n- struct linux_device: to know ldev layout (dev_name, device member etc.) and to see what is written into ldev and its embedded device \u2014 again to decide if writes affect the parameter variables or only pointed-to objects.\n\n- struct linux_driver: to know the types of sdrv, dev_open and dev_close members so we can examine their prototypes/signatures and understand what the calls ldrv->dev_open(...) and ldrv->dev_close(...) may do.\n\n- to_linux_bus(struct metal_bus *): the conversion function/prototype (or macro) must be inspected to ensure it does not assign to the incoming bus parameter (would be a direct parameter modification) or otherwise cause aliasing that changes interpretation of subsequent accesses.\n\n- for_each_linux_driver (macro/iterator): the loop macro/iterator expansion must be checked to ensure it does not modify the function parameters (bus, dev_name, device) implicitly (e.g., by assigning through a macro parameter) and to see how ldrv is obtained.\n\n- linux_driver::dev_open and linux_driver::dev_close (prototypes): their signatures and behaviors matter to confirm they do not receive the original function parameters in a way that would cause the function to write back into the target function\u2019s parameter variables (and to confirm they only mutate objects passed by pointer \u2014 which is allowed).\n\n- malloc / free / memset / strncpy (prototypes/semantics): standard library calls are used; their prototypes confirm they don't modify the target function's parameter variables themselves (they operate on memory objects) and strncpy usage confirms dev_name is only read, not written.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (prototype): needed to ensure it mutates the list nodes/objects (allowed) and does not attempt to reassign the bus parameter variable itself.\n\n- explicit member names (metal_device->name, metal_device->node, metal_device->bus, linux_device->dev_name, linux_device->device, linux_driver->sdrv): quick reference to the exact fields written/read in the function so the analyzer can determine whether writes target the pointer parameters themselves or objects they point to.\n\nWith these symbols (types, macro expansions and callee prototypes/definitions) an analyzer can decide whether any assignment or side-effect in metal_linux_dev_open changes the parameter variables bus, dev_name or device (which would violate MISRA) or only modifies objects pointed to by those pointers (which is allowed)."
