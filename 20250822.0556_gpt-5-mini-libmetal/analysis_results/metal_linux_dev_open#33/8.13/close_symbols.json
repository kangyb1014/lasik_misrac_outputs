  "explanation": "For MISRA C \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" we must know which objects are actually modified or required mutable. Each symbol below is required and why:\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - The function allocates, zeroes (memset) and assigns fields of ldev (dev_name, fd, ldrv, device). To decide whether ldev (and pointers to it) could be const we need the full structure definition to see which fields are mutable and how they are used.\n\n- struct linux_driver\n  - ldrv is iterated and its fields (sdrv, dev_open, dev_close) are inspected and used. We need the driver struct to determine whether the pointer ldrv could be a pointer-to-const and whether any fields would require non-const access.\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - lbus (returned by to_linux_bus) is passed to dev_open/dev_close. To determine whether lbus/underlying bus pointer could be const-qualified we need the linux_bus definition and how it is used by drivers.\n\n- struct metal_device\n  - The function writes into *device and sets (*device)->name and node into bus lists. The metal_device definition (types of name, bus, node) is required to determine whether those pointers/fields should be const or must remain mutable.\n\n- struct metal_bus\n  - The input parameter bus is used to store ldev->device.bus and its member devices is modified by metal_list_add_tail. The metal_bus definition (devices field type) is needed to know whether bus must be non-const because its members are mutated.\n\n- for_each_linux_driver (macro/definition)\n  - The macro determines the declared type of ldrv (e.g., whether it is declared as pointer-to-const) and whether ldrv is treated read-only. Knowing the iterator macro expansion is necessary to decide const qualification of ldrv.\n\n- linux_driver->dev_open and linux_driver->dev_close (function pointer types/prototypes)\n  - The signatures of these callbacks (parameter types and whether they take const pointers) determine whether passing lbus/ldev as non-const is required by the callee; they also indicate whether the callee may mutate the pointed objects, preventing const qualification here.\n\n- to_linux_bus (prototype)\n  - The prototype shows whether converting a metal_bus to linux_bus requires a non-const metal_bus* or can accept a const metal_bus*. This affects whether the bus parameter of metal_linux_dev_open could be const-qualified.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (prototype)\n  - This call mutates the bus->devices list. The function prototype reveals whether it accepts/needs non-const pointers (and thus proves bus/devices must be mutable), which is central to deciding const qualification of bus and related pointers.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine which pointers in metal_linux_dev_open are actually modified or passed to APIs that require non-const, and therefore whether any of them could/should be const-qualified under MISRA C."
