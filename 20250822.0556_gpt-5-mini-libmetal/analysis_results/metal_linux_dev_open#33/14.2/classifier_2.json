  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_dev_open:\n```c\nstatic int metal_linux_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\tconst char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t\tstruct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = NULL;\n\tstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n\tint error;\n\n\tldev = malloc(sizeof(*ldev));\n\tif (!ldev)\n\t\treturn -ENOMEM;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) {\n\n\t\t/* Check if we have a viable driver. */\n\t\tif (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\n\t\t/* Allocate a linux device if we haven't already. */\n\t\tif (!ldev)\n\t\t\tldev = malloc(sizeof(*ldev));\n\t\tif (!ldev)\n\t\t\treturn -ENOMEM;\n\n\t\t/* Reset device data. */\n\t\tmemset(ldev, 0, sizeof(*ldev));\n\t\tstrncpy(ldev->dev_name, dev_name, sizeof(ldev->dev_name) - 1);\n\t\tldev->fd = -1;\n\t\tldev->ldrv = ldrv;\n\t\tldev->device.bus = bus;\n\n\t\t/* Try and open the device. */\n\t\terror = ldrv->dev_open(lbus, ldev);\n\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\tldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev);\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t*device = &ldev->device;\n\t\t(*device)->name = ldev->dev_name;\n\n\t\tmetal_list_add_tail(&bus->devices, &(*device)->node);\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}\n\n\tif (ldev)\n\t\tfree(ldev);\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_add_tail(&bus->devices, &(*device)->node);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is a function call in the body of the for_each_linux_driver loop and does not affect the for\u2011statement header clauses. Rule 14.2 governs the for statement clauses (initialisation, condition and iteration). A body call only causes a Rule 14.2 violation if the loop\u2019s second or third clause accesses an object that the body (including called functions) modifies. In this code the loop iterates drivers (for_each_linux_driver) and does not use bus->devices or *device in its condition/iteration, so this call to metal_list_add_tail does not violate Rule 14.2."
