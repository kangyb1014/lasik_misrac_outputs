  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_dev_open:\n```c\nstatic int metal_linux_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\tconst char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t\tstruct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = NULL;\n\tstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n\tint error;\n\n\tldev = malloc(sizeof(*ldev));\n\tif (!ldev)\n\t\treturn -ENOMEM;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) {\n\n\t\t/* Check if we have a viable driver. */\n\t\tif (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\n\t\t/* Allocate a linux device if we haven't already. */\n\t\tif (!ldev)\n\t\t\tldev = malloc(sizeof(*ldev));\n\t\tif (!ldev)\n\t\t\treturn -ENOMEM;\n\n\t\t/* Reset device data. */\n\t\tmemset(ldev, 0, sizeof(*ldev));\n\t\tstrncpy(ldev->dev_name, dev_name, sizeof(ldev->dev_name) - 1);\n\t\tldev->fd = -1;\n\t\tldev->ldrv = ldrv;\n\t\tldev->device.bus = bus;\n\n\t\t/* Try and open the device. */\n\t\terror = ldrv->dev_open(lbus, ldev);\n\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\tldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev);\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t*device = &ldev->device;\n\t\t(*device)->name = ldev->dev_name;\n\n\t\tmetal_list_add_tail(&bus->devices, &(*device)->node);\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}\n\n\tif (ldev)\n\t\tfree(ldev);\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment \"if (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open)\" appears in the body of the for loop (from for_each_linux_driver). It merely reads members of the loop counter object (ldrv) and does not modify the loop counter or other objects used in the for header clauses. Rule 14.2 concerns the for-loop header clauses (initialisation, condition and iteration) and forbids modifications of objects used there from the loop body or non\u2011persistent side effects in the condition/iteration expressions. This fragment does not appear in the for header, does not modify the loop counter, and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
