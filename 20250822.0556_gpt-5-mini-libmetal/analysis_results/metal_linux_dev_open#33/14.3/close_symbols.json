  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C Rationale (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n1) for_each_linux_driver (macro)\n   - The loop in the function is for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv). To decide whether the loop's controlling expression is invariant we must see the macro expansion (the actual for/while expression and iteration/update). If the macro expands to an infinite loop or a loop with a constant condition, that would violate the rule; if it expands to a standard traversal (e.g. testing against a list head), it is not invariant. The macro definition is therefore essential.\n\n2) underlying list iteration macros (e.g. list_for_each_entry, list_entry) and struct list_head\n   - The for_each_linux_driver macro is typically implemented using generic list macros. Those macros determine the actual controlling expression (e.g. node != head) and how the loop variable changes. To assess invariance we must inspect these primitives and the list_head sentinel semantics.\n\n3) struct linux_bus (definition)\n   - The macro operates on the bus (lbus) to get the driver list (e.g. lbus->drivers). Knowing the exact field name/type used by the macro and whether that field is a sentinel or constant is necessary to determine whether the loop condition can change.\n\n4) struct linux_driver (definition) including fields: sdrv, dev_open, dev_close\n   - The conditional inside the loop uses ldrv->sdrv and ldrv->dev_open. To determine whether those sub-expressions are invariant across iterations we must know their types and whether they are compile-time constants or runtime-modifiable members. Also we must confirm that ldrv itself actually changes between iterations (depends on loop macro and driver list structure).\n\n5) prototypes/definitions of the function-pointer types for linux_driver->dev_open and linux_driver->dev_close\n   - These prototypes show how the callbacks are invoked (parameters passed by value) and whether they could in principle modify local variables in metal_linux_dev_open. For example, a dev_open signature taking struct linux_device * cannot directly reassign the local ldev pointer; knowing signatures helps rule out aliasing that would make a controlling expression change.\n\n6) definitions/implementations (initializers) of the struct linux_driver instances linked into the lbus driver list\n   - The actual driver objects in lbus->drivers determine runtime values of ldrv->sdrv and ldrv->dev_open across iterations. Static analysis needs to inspect how these instances are initialized (are pointers NULL or constant?) and whether the collection is static/constant. If all entries have identical sdrv/dev_open values and the list has a single element, some conditions might be invariant; conversely, varying initializers show non-invariance.\n\n7) to_linux_bus (function definition)\n   - to_linux_bus produces lbus from the incoming bus pointer. We must ensure this conversion doesn't produce a constant lbus that would make the loop control invariant (e.g. if to_linux_bus always returns a pointer to a single static bus with no drivers). Also check for side effects (unlikely but relevant) that could affect subsequent control expressions.\n\n8) struct linux_device (definition)\n   - The code allocates ldev and later checks if (!ldev) inside the loop. To decide whether that check is invariant we must reason about ldev's lifetime and about whether callbacks (dev_open/dev_close) could legitimately change the ldev variable or its validity. Knowing struct linux_device and the semantics of dev_close (via its prototype/implementation) helps determine whether the pointer value could become NULL or otherwise be changed during the loop.\n\nIn short: to decide if any controlling expression in this function (the for_each loop and the if conditions inside it, e.g. if (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open), if (!ldev)) is an invariant, the macro expansion, the list/list-head structure, bus/driver/device type definitions, the registered driver instances, and the callback prototypes/implementations are required. These symbols let an analyst determine whether loop/if conditions remain constant for all iterations or can change at runtime."
