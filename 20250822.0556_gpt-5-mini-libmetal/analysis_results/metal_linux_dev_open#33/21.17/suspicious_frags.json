  "explanation": "Only one call to a <string.h> string-copy function appears in this function (the strncpy call reported above). The other use of a string-handling function here is memset(ldev, 0, sizeof(*ldev)); which does not risk accessing beyond the allocated object because ldev is allocated (checked for NULL and returned from the function on allocation failure) before it is used and the size passed is sizeof(*ldev), matching the allocated object. No other <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset beyond the single safe use, memcmp, strcpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function, and therefore there are no additional string-handling sites that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
