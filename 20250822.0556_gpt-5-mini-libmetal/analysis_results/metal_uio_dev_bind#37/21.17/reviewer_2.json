  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct in the absence of a documented guarantee that ldrv->drv_name and ldev->dev_name are valid NUL\u2011terminated strings (and non\u2011NULL). strlen scans until it finds a '\\0' and will read beyond the object if the buffer is completely filled (or the pointer is invalid), which is exactly the behaviour MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids. The code also uses %s in logging and strcmp on these members, which have the same assumption. If there is no external API/invariant that guarantees these members are valid, NUL\u2011terminated strings, then the use of strlen here is a potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and thus a MISRA 21.17 violation. If, however, the surrounding code or API contract provably guarantees NUL termination and non\u2011NULL pointers for these fields, then the usage would be acceptable."
