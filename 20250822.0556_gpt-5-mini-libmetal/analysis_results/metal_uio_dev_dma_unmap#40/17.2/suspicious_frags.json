  "explanation": "The provided function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap contains no function calls at all \u2014 its body only casts each parameter to void to suppress unused-parameter warnings. There are no calls to itself (direct recursion) and no calls to any other functions that could form an indirect recursion chain. The function is declared static (translation-unit scope), so there are no visible external linkage concerns in the snippet. The duplicate definition in the additional code is identical and likewise contains no calls; it does not introduce recursion. There are also no function-pointer uses, callbacks, or macro expansions in the supplied code that could cause indirect self-calls. Therefore, based on the code provided, there are no fragments that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (functions shall not call themselves). If code outside this snippet (not provided) contains calls or function-pointer wiring that could cause recursion, that is beyond the scope of the supplied code and would need separate review."
