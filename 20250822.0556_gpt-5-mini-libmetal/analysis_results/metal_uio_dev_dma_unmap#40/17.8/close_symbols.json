  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule checking you must know which parameters are pointers (pointer parameters may have their pointees modified but the pointer itself must not be assigned). The function parameters are pointer types to struct linux_bus, struct linux_device and struct metal_sg, and a scalar uint32_t. Provide the definitions/type declarations for: 1) struct linux_bus \u2014 to confirm it is a struct type and whether the parameter is a plain pointer or has any const/volatile qualification; 2) struct linux_device \u2014 same reason as (1); 3) struct metal_sg \u2014 same reason as (1) for the sg parameter; 4) uint32_t \u2014 to confirm that dir is a scalar (not some unexpected typedef to a pointer or qualified type). These symbols let the analyzer determine whether parameters are pointer or non\u2011pointer, and whether any const/volatile qualifiers exist that affect whether modifying the parameter (or its pointee) would violate the MISRA rule."
