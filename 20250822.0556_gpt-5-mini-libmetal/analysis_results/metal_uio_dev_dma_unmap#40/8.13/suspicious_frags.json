  "explanation": "I selected all pointer declarations present in the provided code snippets that are plausible candidates for being pointers-to-const and therefore should be examined for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameters lbus, ldev and sg are unused in the body (cast to void), which strongly suggests they could be qualified as pointers to const and thus warrant inspection. The struct blocks include pointer members (sbus, ldrv, sdev, override, virt, io) that may also be candidates for const qualification depending on usage and should be reviewed. I did not include items that are already const-qualified (e.g. const char *bus_name), non-pointer entities (arrays, integer fields such as fd, len, driver array), or fragments not present in the supplied code. Some pointer members may legitimately need to be mutable due to broader program semantics; those cases require contextual review, which is why they were included for investigation rather than automatically assumed to be incorrect."
