True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe struct metal_sg fields are raw pointers but there is no indication they must be used to modify the pointed-to objects. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 these pointer targets should be const-qualified where possible. For example, if metal_sg is used only to describe buffer addresses/regions for DMA operations and code does not modify the memory or the metal_io_region through these pointers, the declaration should be:\n\nstruct metal_sg {\n    const void *virt;                 /* CPU virtual address (read-only) */\n    const struct metal_io_region *io; /* IO region (read-only) */\n    int len;\n};\n\nAs written (void *virt; struct metal_io_region *io;) the code violates Rule 8.13. If, however, callers write through virt or modify the pointed metal_io_region object, then const would be inappropriate and the current declaration would not violate the rule.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n...\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to objects are not modified. The provided code only shows the function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap which simply casts its parameters to void (they are unused here), and the struct metal_sg definition where fields are declared as mutable pointers. From these snippets alone you cannot determine whether the data pointed to by virt or io is ever modified elsewhere. Rule 8.13 would be violated only if it is provable that the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere those pointers are used and thus the declarations could safely be changed to point-to-const. No such evidence is provided. Therefore the claim of a definite MISRA 8.13 violation is not supported. (If a codebase review shows that virt and io are only ever read, then the struct should be changed to use const pointers, but that is a separate code-change decision.)"
