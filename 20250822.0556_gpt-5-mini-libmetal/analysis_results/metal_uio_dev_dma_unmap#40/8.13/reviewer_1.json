Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 these should be const-qualified (for example: const struct linux_driver *ldrv; const struct sysfs_device *sdev; const struct sysfs_attribute *override) to indicate they are non\u2011modifiable through this struct.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 R8.13 encourages qualifying pointer targets with const when they are never modified, but you must have evidence that the pointee is in fact immutable and that the declaration can be changed without breaking required interfaces. In this case: (1) metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap() simply ignores its pointer parameters (casts them to void) \u2014 there is no local modification in the function, but that alone does not prove the pointees are globally immutable. (2) The non\u2011const pointer members in struct linux_device (ldrv, sdev, override) might be read\u2011only in some usages, but the provided code does not show they are never modified elsewhere; changing their types to const would be a semantic/API change and may be impossible if other code needs to write through those pointers or if the function must match an existing non\u2011const callback prototype. (3) MISRA compliance requires a project\u2011wide decision based on actual usage: if those pointers are truly never used to modify the pointed objects, they should be const; otherwise they must remain non\u2011const. Because the agent\u2019s claim is based on assumption rather than demonstrated immutability or an unnecessary non\u2011const declaration, the report is not justified by the supplied code. Recommendation: audit all uses of ldrv, sdev and override (and the callback prototypes) \u2014 if they are never written through, change their declarations to point to const; otherwise leave them as-is."
