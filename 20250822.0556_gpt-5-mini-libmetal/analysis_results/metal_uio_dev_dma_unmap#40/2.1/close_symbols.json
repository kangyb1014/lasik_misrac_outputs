  ],
  "explanation": "To determine whether this empty static function is unreachable (i.e., dead code under the MISRA rule), the analyser must know every possible way it can be invoked or referenced. Direct callers show explicit call sites. Any address-taken occurrences or struct/table initializers show indirect calls through function-pointer dispatch (common for driver ops). Registration/initialization functions demonstrate whether those tables are actually published and therefore can make the function reachable at runtime. The file-local static call graph is needed because the function is static (internal linkage) and only code in the same translation unit can call it; listing all static functions and edges lets you prove absence of callers. Finally, conditional-compilation/build symbols can enable or disable both the function and its callers, so they must be known to decide if the function is unreachable in the built project configuration."
