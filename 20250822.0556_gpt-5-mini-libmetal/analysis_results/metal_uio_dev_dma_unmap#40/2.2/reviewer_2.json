  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. While each line (void) dir; etc. is a no-op at runtime (removing it does not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour), those casts are a conventional, intentional way to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler/tool warnings. MISRA\u2019s prohibition on dead code is aimed at genuinely superfluous operations that serve no purpose; the unused-parameter idiom documents intent and affects build diagnostics (and therefore the development process), so it is not treated as a violations in normal practice. In short: the statements are deliberate annotations to silence/record unused parameters and are not the sort of dead code Rule 2.2 targets \u2014 the agent A report is incorrect."
