  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\t    struct linux_device *ldev,\n\t\t\t\t    uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t    struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t    int nents)\n{\n\t(void) lbus;\n\t(void) ldev;\n\t(void) dir;\n\t(void) sg;\n\t(void) nents;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\t(void) sg;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The statement '(void) sg;' inside metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap is a no-op (used only to silence an unused-parameter warning). It is executed but has no effect on program behaviour, so removing it would not change program behaviour. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
