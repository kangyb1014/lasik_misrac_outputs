  "explanation": "The function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It only performs (void) casts of its parameters to suppress unused-parameter warnings; these casts are compile-time no-ops and do not access or modify the memory referenced by the pointer parameters. There is no pointer dereference, no buffer or array access, and no pointer arithmetic in the body. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
