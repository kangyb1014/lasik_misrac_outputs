This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The function body contains only (void) casts of its parameters and has no calls, no uses of variables, and no references to any string-handling functions or macros. Therefore there are no external functions (e.g., memcpy, memset, strcpy, etc.), no type member accesses, and no macros that need to be inspected to determine compliance with the <string.h> bounds rule."
