  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameters themselves. The function does not assign to ldev or lbus (no statements like `ldev = ...` or `lbus = ...`). Assignments such as `ldev->override = NULL;` and `ldev->sdev = NULL;` modify the objects referred to by the pointer parameter, which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The `(void)lbus;` idiom does not modify the parameter, and calls using members (e.g. `sysfs_write_attribute(ldev->override, \"\", 1);`, `close(ldev->fd);`) do not alter the pointer variables. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
