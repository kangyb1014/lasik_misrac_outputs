  "explanation": "1) struct linux_device (full definition): The loop and the if statements read members of ldev (device, override, sdev, fd). To determine whether the controlling expressions are invariant you must know the exact types and declarations of these members (e.g. whether they are const or volatile, or macros/compile\u2011time constants). The struct definition shows the types and qualifiers of override, sdev and fd and whether any are compile-time invariant.\n\n2) definition of ldev->device type (nested device struct with num_regions and regions[]): The for-loop controlling expression is i < ldev->device.num_regions. You need the nested device type to know the type, qualifiers and storage of num_regions (is it a constant, const-qualified, volatile, or computed?) and whether num_regions can be changed by other means. The device type also shows how regions[] is declared (fixed-size array vs pointer) which affects whether num_regions is derived or fixed.\n\n3) definition of the region element type (device.regions[i] fields virt and size): metal_unmap is called with regions[i].virt and regions[i].size inside the loop. Knowing the region element layout and types is needed to reason whether indexing/arguments could alias or otherwise allow metal_unmap to mutate num_regions or other controlling data (e.g. if regions contains metadata that metal_unmap can use to modify the device structure).\n\n4) metal_unmap (prototype and implementation): metal_unmap is called inside the loop; to decide whether the loop's controlling expression (i < num_regions) is invariant during iteration you must know whether metal_unmap has side effects that could modify ldev, device.num_regions, or any object used in the loop condition. The prototype/body reveals whether it can access or mutate the controlling data (directly or via global state/aliases)."
