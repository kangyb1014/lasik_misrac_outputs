  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The line (void)lbus; is the common, intentional idiom to mark a function parameter as explicitly unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA's concern in Rule 2.2 is genuine dead code (operations that are executed but whose removal would change or mask faults in program behaviour). The (void) cast is a deliberate no-op that documents intent and prevents an unused-parameter diagnostic; it is treated as an intentional use rather than latent dead code in MISRA practice. If you prefer to avoid this idiom you can remove the parameter name from the function signature or use a standard UNUSED_PARAM macro, but the presence of (void)lbus; does not constitute a MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 violation."
