  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (the for loop that calls metal_unmap over ldev->device.num_regions and the surrounding loop control) perform explicit resource cleanup (unmapping device regions) and therefore have observable side effects; removing them would change program behaviour and so are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2. The if guards (if (ldev->override), if (ldev->sdev), if (ldev->fd >= 0)) are conditional checks that control whether cleanup actions are invoked and are not dead code by themselves. The loop variable declaration and use (unsigned int i; for (i = 0; ...)) are required for the iteration and are not dead. The fragments listed above are flagged because they are either no-op expressions ((void)lbus;) or operations whose effect is unclear from the snippet (writing an empty string to sysfs, assigning pointer members to NULL immediately before returning, and the close call without resetting the stored fd) and therefore warrant investigation to determine whether they are truly necessary or constitute dead code per MISRA C Rule 2.2."
