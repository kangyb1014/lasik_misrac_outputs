  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string-handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the shown function. The function only calls metal_unmap, sysfs_write_attribute, sysfs_close_device and close; none of these are direct uses of <string.h> APIs in this translation unit. The string literal \"\" passed to sysfs_write_attribute is not itself a string.h function call \u2014 any internal use of string functions would be in the implementation of sysfs_write_attribute or other called functions, which are outside the provided code and therefore not subject to this local inspection. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
