  "explanation": "The listed fragments are conditional or iterated code paths whose execution may be entirely skipped at runtime (e.g. num_regions == 0, override == NULL, sdev == NULL, fd < 0). These are the places most likely to contain unreachable code due to project-level invariants or incorrect assumptions and therefore should be investigated for Rule 2.1 compliance.\n\nOther parts of the function (the function header, the local declaration of i, the (void)lbus; statement, and the surrounding braces) are simple declarations or a deliberate no-op to silence an unused parameter; they are not themselves unreachable code and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.1. Note: potential issues such as missing null-checks on the ldev pointer are not instances of unreachable code (they are possible undefined-behavior concerns) and so were not included in the suspicious_frags list."
