Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_condition_wait can violate the MISRA-C rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect any code that could contain for statements whose behaviour would be considered part of this function (directly or via inlining/called functions). The listed symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: direct callee. Its implementation may contain for loops; if inlined or if those loops\u2019 behaviour needs to be considered, you must check they satisfy the MISRA for\u2011loop clauses.\n- metal_mutex_release: direct callee. Same reason as above.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: direct callee. Same reason as above.\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong: used in this function. This is normally a macro/inline or library routine; its implementation could contain loops (or macros) and must be checked for any for statements and for compliance with the for\u2011loop clauses.\n- atomic_load: as above \u2014 may be an inline/macro implementation that could include loops.\n- atomic_fetch_add: as above \u2014 check implementation for any for loops and their conformity.\n- atomic_fetch_sub: as above.\n- syscall: the syscall wrapper/macro implementation could include loops or constructs that affect analysis; include it to be sure no for loops are hidden there.\n- SYS_futex: futex syscall identifier (constant). Include to locate the syscall usage/implementation if system-specific wrappers exist that could contain for loops.\n- FUTEX_WAIT: futex operation constant \u2014 same rationale as SYS_futex (to trace platform wrappers).\n- struct metal_condition (definition: members mptr, wakeups, waiters): the code reads/writes these members. If any for loops in callees refer to these objects (e.g., as loop counters or flags), you need the exact member types to determine whether they are (a) valid loop counters, (b) objects modified in loop bodies (rule prohibits using non\u2011loop counter objects modified in loop bodies in the loop test), and to understand any aliasing/inlining effects.\n- metal_mutex_t (definition/type): the mutex type passed into calls; its implementation/operations may include for loops (e.g., spin loops) that would need to be inspected for MISRA compliance.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for statements; however, MISRA\u2019s rule includes the behaviour of functions called within a for loop body, and implementations of the listed symbols may be inlined or contain for loops. To be conservative and complete, inspect the implementations/definitions of each listed symbol to determine any potential for\u2011loop violations that are reachable from metal_condition_wait."
