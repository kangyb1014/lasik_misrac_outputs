  "explanation": "I inspected every statement in the function. There are no calls to any functions from <string.h> (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar). The code only uses atomic operations, mutex helpers (metal_mutex_*), syscall, and integer/pointer casts. There are no indirect calls via function pointers or macros that expand to string.h functions, and there is no explicit buffer copying or string manipulation. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 to report."
