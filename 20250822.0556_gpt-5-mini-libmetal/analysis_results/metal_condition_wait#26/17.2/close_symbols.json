  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_condition_wait is (directly or indirectly) recursive we must inspect all functions it calls and any functions reachable transitively from those callees that could call back into metal_condition_wait. Explaination per symbol:\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: Called directly by metal_condition_wait; its body must be checked to ensure it does not call metal_condition_wait (direct recursion) or call other functions that do.\n- metal_mutex_release: Called directly before sleeping; its implementation could call back into condition-wait or call other functions that eventually do, producing indirect recursion.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: Called after wakeup; its implementation must be checked for calls back to metal_condition_wait (direct/indirect).\n- consumer_thread: Listed as a caller of metal_condition_wait in the static graph; its body may call mutex/IRQ helpers that could form a cycle back into metal_condition_wait and thus must be examined for mutual recursion paths.\n- producer_thread: Same rationale as consumer_thread \u2014 a caller that might participate in a recursive cycle involving mutex/condition functions.\n- mutex_thread: Appears in the call graph as a caller of mutex functions; inspect it as it could be part of an indirect recursion chain.\n- metal_irq_save_disable: Appears as a caller context for metal_mutex_acquire in the graph; its implementation may call other functions that close a recursion cycle.\n- metal_irq_restore_enable: Related to mutex/IRQ interactions and appears in the graph; needs inspection for possible call-backs.\n- metal_linux_irq_set_enable: Related IRQ helper shown in the graph; include to rule out indirect recursion via IRQ handling code paths.\n- metal_linux_irq_handling: IRQ handling helper in the graph; include to ensure no path from IRQ code leads back to metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_condition_signal: Used by threads around condition variables (present in callers' callees); include to check for mutual recursion between wait and signal implementations.\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong: Used in metal_condition_wait; although usually an intrinsic, its implementation/context should be known to ensure it (or helpers it calls) cannot call metal_condition_wait.\n- atomic_load: Likewise, include to be sure no unexpected call-back exists in its implementation.\n- atomic_fetch_add: Same reason \u2014 used by metal_condition_wait and must not invoke (directly/indirectly) metal_condition_wait.\n- atomic_fetch_sub: Same reason as fetch_add.\n- syscall: The function invokes syscall(SYS_futex); while syscalls are normally not C-level callers of application functions, include syscall to document that the futex call cannot produce a C-level call-back to metal_condition_wait.\n\nIn short: include every direct callee (the three mutex functions and the atomic/syscall primitives) and the nearby thread/IRQ helper functions shown in the static graph because any of those could participate in a call cycle that would violate the MISRA rule. Inspecting these symbols' definitions (and their transitive callees) is sufficient to determine whether metal_condition_wait is part of a recursion cycle."
