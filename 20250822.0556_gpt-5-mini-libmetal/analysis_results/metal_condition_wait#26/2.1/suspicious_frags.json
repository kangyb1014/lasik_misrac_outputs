  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified. Reasons:\n- All return statements are conditional except the final \"return 0;\", which is the last statement in the function (so there is no code following an unconditional return that would be unreachable).\n- The initial input validation (if (!cv || !m || !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m)) return -EINVAL;) is conditional; code after it is reachable when the condition is false.\n- The atomic_compare_exchange_strong() call may succeed or fail; both outcomes lead to reachable code paths: if it fails, tmpmptr is updated and the nested if (tmpmptr != mptr) may or may not perform a conditional return \u2014 this nested return is reachable when tmpmptr differs from mptr.\n- The futex syscall may block at runtime, but that is a runtime blocking behavior, not static unreachable code; execution resumes after wakeup and the subsequent atomic_fetch_sub and metal_mutex_acquire are reachable.\n- There are no constant boolean conditions, no code after an unconditional return, no dead switch/case labels, and no gotos that make later code unreachable.\n\nTherefore, under static analysis for unreachable code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1), this function contains no code fragments that appear to be statically unreachable."
