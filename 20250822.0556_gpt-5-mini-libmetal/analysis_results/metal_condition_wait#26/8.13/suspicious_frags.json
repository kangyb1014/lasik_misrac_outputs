  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are either non-pointer scalar operations (local integer variables, return statements, comments) or declarations/type definitions. The struct and typedef shown are atomic and integral types (atomic_uintptr_t, atomic_int) whose addresses are used by atomic APIs and the futex syscall; these APIs and the atomic operations require modifiable storage and thus normally cannot use const-qualified pointees. NULL literals and syscall variadic NULL arguments are not pointer declarations that can be const-qualified. Therefore only the pointer-bearing expressions and uses listed above warrant further investigation for possible const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
