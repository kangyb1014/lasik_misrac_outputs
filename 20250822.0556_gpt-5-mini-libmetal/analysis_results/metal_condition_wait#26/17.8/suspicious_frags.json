  "explanation": "I examined all uses of the function parameters cv and m. There are no assignments to the pointer parameters themselves (no occurrences of \"cv = ...\" or \"m = ...\"), only reads of those pointers and operations on the objects they point to. Casting m to an integer (uintptr_t mptr = (uintptr_t)m) does not modify the parameter. All atomic operations and the futex call operate on members of *cv (e.g. cv->mptr, cv->wakeups, cv->waiters) \u2014 modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule. Calls metal_mutex_release(m) and metal_mutex_acquire(m) pass the pointer by value; they do not modify the caller's pointer parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
