  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified, the analyzer must be able to prove that the parameter variable 'm' is not written to anywhere in the function (and cannot be written to indirectly). The listed symbols are required for that reasoning: \n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired, metal_mutex_release, metal_mutex_acquire: their prototypes/definitions are needed to confirm how the parameter 'm' is passed into these calls (by value as a metal_mutex_t *) and to ensure none of them take the address of the caller's parameter variable (e.g. via receiving metal_mutex_t ** or some mechanism that could let them modify the caller's local parameter variable). If they only accept metal_mutex_t * by value, they cannot modify the caller's parameter variable itself (only the object pointed-to, which is allowed by MISRA).\n\n- struct metal_condition (definition including types of mptr, wakeups, waiters): the code reads/writes cv->mptr, cv->wakeups and cv->waiters. Knowing their exact types (e.g. whether mptr is an atomic integer of pointer-sized type) is necessary to understand the atomic operations' argument types and whether any of those operations could alias or write into the storage of 'm' or the parameter variable.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (typedef/definition): to confirm that metal_mutex_t is a pointer target type and to rule out any unusual typedef that could cause unexpected aliasing or pass-by-reference semantics.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub (prototypes/semantics): these atomic helpers' signatures and semantics must be known to verify what memory locations they write to. For example, atomic_compare_exchange_strong takes a pointer to the expected value and may write into that expected object (here &tmpmptr) \u2014 which is a local, not the parameter. Confirming that none of these atomics take an address derived from the parameter variable 'm' is required to conclude 'm' is not modified.\n\n- syscall prototype and SYS_futex / FUTEX_WAIT definitions: the futex syscall is invoked with &cv->wakeups. Knowing its calling convention and that it operates on the wakeups storage (and does not get passed &m or otherwise access the caller's 'm' variable) is necessary to rule out indirect modification of the parameter variable.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let the next analyzer determine whether any call or operation in metal_condition_wait can modify the parameter variable 'm' itself (which would violate MISRA), or only the object pointed to by 'm' (which is allowed)."
