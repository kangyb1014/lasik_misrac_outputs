  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant at compile time. Specifically:\n- The initial guard if (!cv || !m || !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m)) depends on pointer parameters and the runtime result of metal_mutex_is_acquired(), so it is not invariant.\n- The if (!atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&cv->mptr, &tmpmptr, mptr)) depends on the atomic variable cv->mptr and the outcome of an atomic operation; its result is runtime-dependent and not invariant. The nested if (tmpmptr != mptr) compares tmpmptr (modified by the atomic operation) and mptr, so it is also runtime-dependent.\n- There are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) in this function; hence the allowed exceptions for infinite loops or do-while constant false are not relevant.\n- Other statements (atomic_load/atomic_fetch_add/atomic_fetch_sub, system call syscall(SYS_futex,...), mutex release/acquire) are not controlling expressions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
