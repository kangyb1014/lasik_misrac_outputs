  "explanation": "To decide if any controlling expression in metal_condition_wait is invariant we must know program facts beyond the local code. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_condition: The function inspects and atomically manipulates cv->mptr, cv->wakeups and cv->waiters. To determine whether the compare-exchange and subsequent checks can ever change (i.e. whether expressions using these fields are invariant) we need the exact types (atomic qualifiers) and layout of these fields.\n\n- metal_condition_signal: Likely the peer operation that wakes waiters and may modify cv->mptr, cv->wakeups or other condition state. If signal (or other functions) never changes cv->mptr/wakeups then the compare-exchange or atomic loads could be invariant. The signal implementation shows whether other threads can change the controlling expressions' operands.\n\n- metal_condition initialization sites / declarations: The initial value of cv->mptr/wakeups/waiters (and whether cv itself can be NULL) determines whether the conditionals (e.g. the compare-exchange result or tmpmptr checks) can be invariant. We must inspect where and how the condition variable instances are created/initialized.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong and cv->mptr atomic type: The outer if uses atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&cv->mptr, &tmpmptr, mptr). To reason whether that call can always return the same result (making the if controlling expression invariant) we need the precise semantics/ABI of this atomic primitive and the exact atomic type used for mptr (e.g. atomic_uintptr_t). If a non-standard wrapper is used, its behavior might differ from C11.\n\n- atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub and wakeups/waiters types: The code uses these atomics in control-flow-sensitive places (the value v loaded is used in the futex wait, and waiters is incremented/decremented). Knowing the semantics and types lets us reason whether atomic_load(&cv->wakeups) can be invariant at the relevant program points.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: The first if uses !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m). Whether that subexpression is invariant depends on the implementation: does this function actually test per-mutex state, CPU-local state, or is it a stub/constant? We must inspect its code to know if the controlling expression can be constant at all call sites.\n\n- metal_mutex_t type and mutex initializations: If callers always pass the same mutex instance already known to be acquired or if metal_mutex_t encodes an always-acquired state for these uses, the !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m) term could be invariant. We need the mutex type/initialization to conclude this.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread (callsites): Whether the first if is ever true (or always false) depends on how these callers invoke metal_condition_wait: do they ever pass NULL, do they always hold the mutex before calling, do they always use the same condition variable and mutex instance whose state is known at compile/design time? Inspecting these callsites tells us if the controlling expression(s) in metal_condition_wait can be treated as invariant in the analysed program.\n\nIn short, to determine if any controlling expression in metal_condition_wait is invariant (and thus potentially violates the MISRA rule) we must know the types and initial values of the condition-variable fields, the code that modifies those fields (notably signal and initialisers), the exact semantics of the atomic primitives used, the mutex implementation, and the callers' usage patterns for the arguments passed into metal_condition_wait."
