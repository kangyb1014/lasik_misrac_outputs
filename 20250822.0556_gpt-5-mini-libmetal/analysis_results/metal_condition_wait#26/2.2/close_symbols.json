  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- struct metal_condition (definition of fields mptr, wakeups, waiters)\n  Needed to know the exact types (atomic or plain, widths) and which fields are read/modified; required to determine whether operations on those fields are observable elsewhere (i.e. whether they are dead).\n\n- metal_condition initialization routine (e.g. metal_condition_init)\n  Required to determine initial values of mptr/wakeups/waiters and whether the compare-exchange and early-return branch can ever be executed; initialization affects reachability/necessity of code.\n\n- metal_condition_signal\n  The producer/other-side counterpart that will inspect or modify wakeups/waiters/mptr and perform futex wake; needed to see whether modifications in metal_condition_wait are used by signal (so they are not dead).\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong (prototype/semantics)\n  The precise semantics (success/failure conditions and whether it modifies the expected argument) determine whether the compare-and-set and the following branch can be elided without changing behavior.\n\n- atomic_load (prototype/semantics)\n  Needed to understand visibility and ordering of reading wakeups; whether that read is required for correct synchronization (not dead).\n\n- atomic_fetch_add (prototype/semantics)\n  To know whether the increment of waiters has side effects observed by other threads (e.g. signal uses waiters), so it may be necessary.\n\n- atomic_fetch_sub (prototype/semantics)\n  Same as fetch_add: to determine whether decrement of waiters is observable and therefore not removable.\n\n- atomic type typedefs used in struct (e.g. atomic_uintptr_t / atomic_int types used for mptr/wakeups/waiters)\n  Exact atomic types and their sizes/memory-order defaults affect compare-exchange behavior and may affect portability and observability of operations.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (typedef)\n  Required to understand mptr value (the stored uintptr_t for the mutex) and whether casting/compare makes sense; also to check for possible aliasing or special values.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired\n  Determines whether the initial guard (early return) can ever be false or true; affects reachability of the function body and whether the precondition check is dead.\n\n- metal_mutex_release\n  Its semantics (does it block, notify, affect futexes, modify mutex state used elsewhere) are needed to see whether releasing before the futex wait is required to preserve behaviour.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire\n  To know whether re-acquiring after the wake changes program behaviour (can block, ordering effects) and therefore whether those calls are necessary.\n\n- syscall (prototype/semantics)\n  The futex syscall is the blocking synchronization point here; knowledge of syscall semantics (blocking, signals, return codes) is essential to judge whether the futex call is meaningful or removable.\n\n- SYS_futex (constant)\n  Needed to identify the syscall invoked; required to connect to futex semantics.\n\n- FUTEX_WAIT (constant)\n  To know the futex operation being used (wait) and its side effects; necessary to see whether sleeping on wakeups is essential.\n\n- FUTEX_WAKE (constant)\n  Required because the wake side (likely in metal_condition_signal) will use FUTEX_WAKE; analyze interaction between wait/wake to decide whether wakeups/waiters/futex operations are necessary.\n\n- EINVAL (constant)\n  The error code returned on some paths; to assess whether those return paths can ever be taken (reachability) and thus whether the checks producing that return are dead.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any operation in metal_condition_wait is dead, you must see how the cv fields are initialized and used elsewhere (especially signal), the precise semantics of the atomic primitives, the mutex operations, and the futex/syscall interactions and constants. The symbols above provide that context so the analyzer can decide whether removing each operation would change program behaviour."
