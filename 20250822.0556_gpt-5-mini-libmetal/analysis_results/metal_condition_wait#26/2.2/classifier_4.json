  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_condition_wait:\n```c\nint metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv,\n\t\t\t\t       metal_mutex_t *m)\n{\n\tuintptr_t tmpmptr = 0, mptr = (uintptr_t)m;\n\tint v = 0;\n\n\t/* Check if the mutex has been acquired */\n\tif (!cv || !m || !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\tif (!atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&cv->mptr, &tmpmptr, mptr)) {\n\t\tif (tmpmptr != mptr)\n\t\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\n\tv = atomic_load(&cv->wakeups);\n\tatomic_fetch_add(&cv->waiters, 1);\n\n\t/* Release the mutex before sleeping. */\n\tmetal_mutex_release(m);\n\tsyscall(SYS_futex, &cv->wakeups, FUTEX_WAIT, v, NULL, NULL, 0);\n\tatomic_fetch_sub(&cv->waiters, 1);\n\t/* Acquire the mutex after it's waken up. */\n\tmetal_mutex_acquire(m);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nuintptr_t tmpmptr = 0, mptr = (uintptr_t)m;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Both variables are used: tmpmptr is initialized to 0 and passed to atomic_compare_exchange_strong as the expected value (its initialization matters because the call both reads and may update it), and mptr is used as the desired value for the compare-exchange. Removing these initializations or the assignments would change program behaviour, so the operations are not dead code."
