  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_condition_wait:\n```c\nint metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv,\n\t\t\t\t       metal_mutex_t *m)\n{\n\tuintptr_t tmpmptr = 0, mptr = (uintptr_t)m;\n\tint v = 0;\n\n\t/* Check if the mutex has been acquired */\n\tif (!cv || !m || !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\tif (!atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&cv->mptr, &tmpmptr, mptr)) {\n\t\tif (tmpmptr != mptr)\n\t\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\n\tv = atomic_load(&cv->wakeups);\n\tatomic_fetch_add(&cv->waiters, 1);\n\n\t/* Release the mutex before sleeping. */\n\tmetal_mutex_release(m);\n\tsyscall(SYS_futex, &cv->wakeups, FUTEX_WAIT, v, NULL, NULL, 0);\n\tatomic_fetch_sub(&cv->waiters, 1);\n\t/* Acquire the mutex after it's waken up. */\n\tmetal_mutex_acquire(m);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\natomic_fetch_sub(&cv->waiters, 1);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The atomic_fetch_sub(&cv->waiters, 1) call decrements the shared waiters counter after the thread wakes. Removing it would leave cv->waiters permanently incremented and change program behaviour (affecting synchronization and futex/wake logic). The statement is reachable and its removal would affect observable state, so it is not dead code."
