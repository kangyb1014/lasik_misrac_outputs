  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GNU/Clang extensions such as nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), __typeof__, __attribute__, __asm__, label-as-values, or zero-length array usages.\n- The cast (uintptr_t)m uses the standard uintptr_t type from <stdint.h>; casting a pointer to an integer type is standard C (implementation-defined semantics but not a compiler extension).\n- The atomic_* calls (atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add/sub) are the standard C11 <stdatomic.h> atomic operations, not compiler-only language extensions.\n- The syscall(SYS_futex, ...) call and SYS_futex/FUTEX_WAIT symbols are OS/system-call interfaces (platform-specific), not compiler language extensions.\n- Error macros (EINVAL) and regular function calls are standard C usage.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this code that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
