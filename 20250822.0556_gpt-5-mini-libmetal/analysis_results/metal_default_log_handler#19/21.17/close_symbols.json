  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for the MISRA string-bounds analysis:\n\n- DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON: Controls whether the logging code (including the buffer writes via vsnprintf) is compiled in. If the macro is not defined the function does nothing; only when it is defined must you analyze potential string/buffer writes.\n\n- enum metal_log_level: The definition (underlying integer values and any explicit assignments) is required to determine the possible range of 'level' values passed into the function and how they map to indices into level_strs. An incorrect assumption about enum ranges could hide an out-of-bounds access to level_strs.\n\n- METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY and METAL_LOG_DEBUG: These constants are used to clamp 'level'. Their actual numeric values are needed to verify that the clamp logic (if (level <= METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY || level > METAL_LOG_DEBUG) level = METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY;) prevents out-of-range indexing into level_strs. You must confirm the numeric ordering/values to ensure the check is correct.\n\n- level_strs (array length and element strings): Although the array is shown in the function, an analysis agent must know the exact number of elements (here 8) and that each element is a null-terminated string literal. This ensures that indexing using 'level' cannot read beyond the array bounds and that fprintf(\"%s%s\", ...) reading each string does not read past their terminators.\n\n- msg buffer size (1024): The fixed size of the destination buffer passed to vsnprintf is required to reason about whether writes into msg can exceed its bounds. The analyzer must use this size when checking whether vsnprintf can overrun the buffer.\n\n- vsnprintf (declaration and C standard semantics / guarantees): vsnprintf is the function that writes into msg. Although the MISRA rule mentioned targets <string.h> functions, buffer overrun risk here comes from formatted output functions. You must know the exact behavior guaranteed by the C standard/version in use (C99/C11): that vsnprintf is given the buffer size, will not write more than that size, and will null-terminate if size > 0, and that it returns the number of characters that would have been written (useful for detecting truncation). If the platform's vsnprintf deviates from the standard, that could affect whether the code writes beyond msg.\n\n- fprintf: Used to output level_strs[level] and msg. The analyzer should confirm that fprintf itself does not cause any additional reads/writes beyond the provided null-terminated strings and that the format \"%s%s\" consumes two %s arguments only; this is to ensure no hidden string-library operations introduce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- stderr: The destination stream used by fprintf. Included for completeness: if an implementation provides special behavior for streams or buffering that could interact with writing/reading the provided strings (unusual but relevant for a thorough platform-specific analysis).\n\nNotes: The MISRA rule quoted applies specifically to functions in <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). This function does not call any of those functions directly. The primary possible risk here is buffer overflow via vsnprintf (stdio), and out-of-range array indexing into level_strs; the symbols above provide the information needed to determine whether either risk exists on the target platform and build configuration."
