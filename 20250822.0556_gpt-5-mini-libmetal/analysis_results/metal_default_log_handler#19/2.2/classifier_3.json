Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_default_log_handler:\n```c\nvoid metal_default_log_handler(enum metal_log_level level,\n\t\t\t       const char *format, ...)\n{\n#ifdef DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON\n\tchar msg[1024];\n\tva_list args;\n\tstatic const char * const level_strs[] = {\n\t\t\"metal: emergency: \",\n\t\t\"metal: alert:     \",\n\t\t\"metal: critical:  \",\n\t\t\"metal: error:     \",\n\t\t\"metal: warning:   \",\n\t\t\"metal: notice:    \",\n\t\t\"metal: info:      \",\n\t\t\"metal: debug:     \",\n\t};\n\n\tva_start(args, format);\n\tvsnprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), format, args);\n\tva_end(args);\n\n\tif (level <= METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY || level > METAL_LOG_DEBUG)\n\t\tlevel = METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY;\n\n\tfprintf(stderr, \"%s%s\", level_strs[level], msg);\n#else\n\t(void)level;\n\t(void)format;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvsnprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), format, args);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to vsnprintf writes into msg which is subsequently used by fprintf(\"%s%s\", level_strs[level], msg); removing the vsnprintf call would change program behavior (and could lead to undefined behaviour from using an uninitialized buffer). This is therefore not dead code. (As a counterexample: it would be a violation if the subsequent fprintf were removed or if msg were never used \u2014 in that case the vsnprintf call would be executed but its effects would not affect program behaviour, making it dead code.)"
