Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_default_log_handler:\n```c\nvoid metal_default_log_handler(enum metal_log_level level,\n\t\t\t       const char *format, ...)\n{\n#ifdef DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON\n\tchar msg[1024];\n\tva_list args;\n\tstatic const char * const level_strs[] = {\n\t\t\"metal: emergency: \",\n\t\t\"metal: alert:     \",\n\t\t\"metal: critical:  \",\n\t\t\"metal: error:     \",\n\t\t\"metal: warning:   \",\n\t\t\"metal: notice:    \",\n\t\t\"metal: info:      \",\n\t\t\"metal: debug:     \",\n\t};\n\n\tva_start(args, format);\n\tvsnprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), format, args);\n\tva_end(args);\n\n\tif (level <= METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY || level > METAL_LOG_DEBUG)\n\t\tlevel = METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY;\n\n\tfprintf(stderr, \"%s%s\", level_strs[level], msg);\n#else\n\t(void)level;\n\t(void)format;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nva_end(args);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call va_end(args) is not dead code: it matches the preceding va_start(args) and is required by the C standard to terminate use of the va_list. On some platforms va_end may perform necessary cleanup and on all platforms removing it would at least make the code non\u2011conforming (and could change behavior or invoke undefined behaviour). The call is reachable when DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON is defined, so its removal could affect program behaviour."
