  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to analyze recursion (MISRA rule \"Functions shall not call themselves\"):\n\n- DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON: preprocessor switch that determines whether the body contains any calls. If undefined the function contains no calls and cannot recurse; if defined the calls must be analyzed. Knowing this symbol/value is required to know which branch to analyze.\n\n- vsnprintf: directly invoked in the function (vsnprintf(msg, ...)). You must inspect vsnprintf's implementation/call graph to confirm it does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_default_log_handler.\n\n- vfprintf: many C library implementations have fprintf implemented on top of vfprintf; analyzing vfprintf is necessary because fprintf may dispatch to it internally. If vfprintf calls back (directly/indirectly) into the logging function, that would be recursion.\n\n- fprintf: directly invoked (fprintf(stderr, ...)). Its implementation/call graph must be checked to ensure it does not call metal_default_log_handler (directly or via other library routines).\n\n- stderr: the FILE* passed to fprintf. Some platforms allow user-provided/customized FILE operations (custom write/flush hooks). You must verify whether the runtime's FILE structure for stderr can cause callbacks into user logging code that would reach metal_default_log_handler.\n\n- write, fwrite, fputs, fputc, fflush: common lower-level I/O/syscall or stdio helpers used by printf-family implementations. If any of these routines (or the platform-specific hooks they call) can invoke user callbacks that in turn call metal_default_log_handler, that would create indirect recursion. Their call graphs (or confirmation they cannot call back into user logging) are needed.\n\n- enum metal_log_level: the parameter type; included to ensure there are no hidden function-like semantics (not a function, but needed to understand bounds checks and that no function pointer or callback is embedded in the enum).\n\n- METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY and METAL_LOG_DEBUG: the enum constants used for bounds checks. They don't cause recursion themselves but are needed to understand control flow (which branch is taken) and whether the fprintf/vsnprintf calls are reachable.\n\nIn short: you must examine the call graphs/implementations for vsnprintf and fprintf (and the lower-level I/O routines they use), plus any platform-specific hooks tied to stderr, and account for whether the DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON branch is active. Confirming none of those routines (or their call chains) invoke metal_default_log_handler is necessary to prove the function does not call itself (directly or indirectly)."
