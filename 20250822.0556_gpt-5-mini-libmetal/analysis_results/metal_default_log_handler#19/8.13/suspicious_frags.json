  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where applicable or are not pointer object declarations. Specifically:\n- The function parameter \"const char *format\" is already const-qualified.\n- \"static const char * const level_strs[] = { ... }\" declares both the pointed-to characters and the pointers as const, so it complies.\n- \"va_list args;\" is not a pointer-to-object type in the sense targeted by Rule 8.13 and is used only with the variadic APIs; it does not indicate a missing const qualification.\n- Calls to vsnprintf and va_start/va_end use the buffer and format appropriately (the format parameter passed to vsnprintf is const-qualified), and the enum parameter \"level\" is not a pointer type.\n- The macro/identifier \"stderr\" and the FILE* argument to fprintf are part of the C standard library interface (outside this translation unit) and cannot be changed here to add const qualification.\nTherefore, besides the listed fragments (the mutable buffer declaration and its subsequent use as a non-const string argument), there are no other obvious locations in this function that warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
