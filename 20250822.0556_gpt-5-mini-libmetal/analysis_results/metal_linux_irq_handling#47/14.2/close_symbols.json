  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C requirements for well-formed for-loops we must determine (a) what the for-loop clauses actually are, (b) which object(s) those clauses read or depend on, and (c) whether any called function or macro used in the loop body can modify those objects or the loop counter. The following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- metal_bitmap_for_each_set_bit (macro)\n  - Reason: The source uses this macro which likely expands to a for-loop. To judge clause 1\u20134 we need the macro expansion to know the exact first/second/third clauses, the loop counter it defines/uses, and whether the macro introduces additional hidden side-effects (e.g. modifying other objects in the clauses).\n\n- metal_bitmap_next_set_bit (function/macro)\n  - Reason: The for-each macro commonly calls this helper to advance the iterator. We must inspect its signature and side-effects to ensure it only advances the loop counter and does not modify objects that appear in the for second/third clauses (or other objects used by those clauses).\n\n- irqs_enabled (bitmap object)\n  - Reason: This bitmap is an operand of the for-each macro (the set being iterated). MISRA forbids using objects in the second clause that are modified in the loop body or by called functions; we must know whether irqs_enabled can be modified inside the loop body or by called functions (directly or via aliasing).\n\n- linux_irq_cntr and its member irq_num\n  - Reason: The iteration limit (third argument to the macro) is linux_irq_cntr.irq_num. We need to know whether this value is stable across the loop body and not modified by functions called inside the loop (clause 2 prohibits using objects modified by the loop body).\n\n- metal_irq_handle (function)\n  - Reason: Called inside the for loop body. MISRA requires considering the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body. We need its prototype and side-effects to verify it does not modify the loop counter(s) (i) or any object used in the for second clause (e.g. pfds_total, irqs_enabled, linux_irq_cntr.irq_num) or otherwise cause persistent side-effects that violate the rule.\n\n- irqs (array of irq descriptors)\n  - Reason: Passed to metal_irq_handle (&irqs[fd]) and thus may alias with internal objects. We need its type and whether accesses to elements can modify/shared objects involved in loop clauses.\n\n- irqs_devs (array mapping fd -> struct metal_device *)\n  - Reason: Used to obtain dev inside the loop; dev is then used to call dev_irq_ack. We must know whether accessing irqs_devs or the device pointer may permit callees to modify loop-clause objects.\n\n- struct metal_device and struct metal_bus (including bus->ops.dev_irq_ack prototype)\n  - Reason: To inspect the signature and semantics of dev_irq_ack implementation. dev_irq_ack is invoked inside the loop; we must ensure that implementation cannot modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop condition (pfds_total, i, etc.).\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_irq_ack (function pointer implementation/semantics)\n  - Reason: The actual function that can run from this pointer might have side-effects. MISRA requires consideration of called functions; we need to confirm it does not change the loop counter or any object that the loop second clause depends on.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire and metal_mutex_release (functions)\n  - Reason: These synchronization functions are called inside and around the loops. We must confirm they do not modify loop counters or objects used in the for conditions (directly or indirectly), and whether they have observable persistent side-effects relevant to clause 2/3 (e.g. modifying global variables used in the for condition).\n\n- Loop counter and control variables: i, j, pfds_total (locals)\n  - Reason: The for-loops in the function use i (both in the bitmap macro and the explicit for i=0; i<pfds_total; i++), and the explicit for uses pfds_total as the loop limit. To verify MISRA clause 4 (only one loop counter and not modified in body) and clauses 2/3, we must ensure these local variables are not modified by called functions or aliases. Documenting their declarations and scopes is required for that reasoning.\n\nNotes: standard library/system calls used inside the loops (read(), poll(), strerror(), errno) do not take or modify the local loop counters or pfds_total, so they are not strictly required beyond their known semantics; the critical unknowns are the macro expansions and the behavior/side-effects of metal_* helpers and device callback implementations listed above."
