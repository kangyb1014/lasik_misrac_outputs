This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required for the MISRA C string-bounds analysis:\n\n- strlen (from <string.h>): The function call strlen(test_case->name) is the source of a potential out-of-bounds read. You must know the precise semantics/declaration of strlen (it reads bytes until a '\\0') to reason whether it could read past the storage for name if name is not properly null-terminated or longer than its allocated size.\n\n- strerror (from <string.h>): Although not a str* bounds risk in this context, strerror(...) is passed to printing as a %s. Include its declaration/semantics to confirm it returns a pointer to a valid null-terminated string and that its use does not introduce any additional out-of-bounds access.\n\n- dots (the string literal \"..................................\"): The code computes pad = dots + strlen(test_case->name). To guarantee no out-of-bounds access you must know the size (number of characters plus terminating '\\0') of this literal so you can check that the computed offset stays within the bounds of the dots object and that pad points to a valid null-terminated character sequence.\n\n- struct metal_test_case (definition \u2014 in particular the 'name' member type and size): To determine whether strlen(test_case->name) is safe you must know how name is declared (e.g., char name[N] vs char *name), the allocated size if it is an array, and whether there is any documented/null-termination guarantee. This directly affects whether strlen may read past the object.\n\n- All code/sites that create/initialize/assign metal_test_case.name (test-registration/initialization code): Even with the struct layout, the runtime safety depends on how name values are written/initialized. You need the functions/macros where test_case->name is set (registration helpers, initializers, strncpy/strcpy/usages) to verify they enforce null-termination and maximum length (so that strlen(name) <= strlen(dots)).\n\n- test_cases (the global list head): To locate all instances of metal_test_case for inspection and to find registration code that populates name, you need the definition/use-sites of the global list test_cases. This lets you enumerate all test_case objects to check their name buffers or initialization paths.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether strlen(test_case->name) can legally read only within the bounds of name and whether computing pad = dots + strlen(name) can produce a pointer that remains within the bounds of the dots object, which are the two potential string-bounds issues in the target function."
