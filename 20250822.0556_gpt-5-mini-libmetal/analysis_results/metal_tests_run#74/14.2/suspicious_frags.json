First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. The only loop-like construct in this function is the metal_list_for_each(...) invocation (a macro that expands to a for statement). Therefore the for-statement (macro invocation) and statements within its body that may interact with the loop control objects need inspection. Other parts of the function do not contain for-statements and so are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2: variable declarations and initializations at the top, the params handling, calls to metal_init and metal_finish, the const strings and pad calculation (aside from their use inside the loop), and other non-loop statements cannot violate the specific requirements of Rule 14.2. No other for loops are present in the function, so no additional fragments need to be inspected for this rule."
