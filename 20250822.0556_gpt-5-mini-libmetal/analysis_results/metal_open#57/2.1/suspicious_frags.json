  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified. Reasoning:\n- There are no statements after a return that would be unconditionally skipped.\n- The guard if (!path || !strlen(path)) is safe with respect to evaluation order: the left operand (!path) is evaluated first and short-circuits, so strlen(path) is not called when path is NULL.\n- The ternary expression (shm ? shm_open(...) : open(...)) has both branches potentially reachable at runtime depending on the value of the parameter shm, so neither branch is statically unreachable.\n- The final return uses a conditional expression (fd < 0 ? -errno : fd) whose outcomes depend on the runtime value of fd; neither outcome is statically unreachable.\n- There are no constant-conditional constructs (e.g., if (0) or if (1)), no infinite loops with code after them, no unused labels/goto targets, and no other patterns that would produce unreachable code.\nTherefore, no code fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
