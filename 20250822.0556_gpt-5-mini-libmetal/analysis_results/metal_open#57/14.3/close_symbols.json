  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to assess MISRA C rule (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- strlen: The if uses !strlen(path). To decide whether that controlling expression can be invariant (always true/false) we must know strlen\u2019s prototype/semantics (return type, that it depends on the contents of path) and whether it can have side effects or a constrained/constant result for the call-sites.\n\n- open: The ternary uses open(...) when shm is false. To determine whether the controlling expression (shm) or the overall expression outcome is invariant we need to see how open is used/returns and whether callers pass arguments that force one branch always taken; knowledge of open\u2019s semantics also affects fd and therefore the later conditional (fd < 0).\n\n- shm_open: Same justification as open: the ternary selects shm_open when shm is true. Understanding shm_open\u2019s semantics and return behavior is necessary to reason about fd and whether fd < 0 is an invariant.\n\n- errno: The return expression uses -errno when fd < 0. To decide whether the ternary result could be an invariant value (and whether fd < 0 itself is invariant), the analysis needs the errno variable (extern) semantics and whether it can be modified by the selected call-branch.\n\n- EINVAL: The function returns -EINVAL when the initial check fails. EINVAL\u2019s definition (constant value) is needed to reason about whether the initial if controlling expression (!path || !strlen(path)) could be invariant and whether the return value is a compile-time constant.\n\n- O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR: These macros/constants appear in the open/shm_open calls. While they do not affect the controlling expressions directly, their values/usage can affect whether open/shm_open behave deterministically across call-sites and thus whether fd (and the fd < 0 test) could be invariant; include them for completeness when reasoning about the called functions\u2019 behavior.\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open: A direct caller of metal_open. To determine if any controlling expression inside metal_open can be considered invariant in the real code base, we must inspect call-sites to see what arguments (path, shm) they pass (e.g., constant string, NULL, fixed shm value). Including the caller lets the analyzer determine whether path or shm are effectively constant for actual usage.\n\n- metal_shmem_open: The other direct caller. Same reason as metal_uio_dev_open: its call patterns determine whether the controlling expressions (checks on path, the shm boolean, and the fd result) can be invariant in practice.\n\nNotes: The listed symbols are the minimal additional items needed to decide whether the controlling expressions in metal_open are statically invariant (always true/false) or depend on runtime data. Inspecting the two callers is particularly important because invariance can arise from callers always passing the same arguments (e.g., a constant non-NULL path or a constant shm value)."
