Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Each symbol and why it is needed for MISRA C 'well-formed for loop' analysis of metal_open:\n\n- strlen: metal_open uses strlen(path) in the early return condition. We must know whether strlen has any persistent side effects or modifies any objects (it does not) because MISRA's second/third-clause restrictions refer to side effects in expressions and to behavior of called functions when those functions appear inside for loop clauses or bodies.\n\n- open: metal_open may call open(path, flags, mode). To conclude metal_open contains no disallowed loop behavior we must know whether open has side effects on objects that could interact with a loop counter or be modified by a loop body (open has I/O side effects but does not modify user-supplied loop counters). Also need its error-reporting semantics (returns -1 and sets errno) because metal_open interprets fd and errno.\n\n- shm_open: same rationale as open: used when shm flag is set; need its side-effect and error-reporting semantics to determine whether any loop-related constraints could be violated by calls to it.\n\n- errno: metal_open reads errno when returning error code. Need to know that errno is a global macro/variable and that reading it has no hidden side effects relevant to loop-counter rules. Also to understand the expression \"-errno\" semantics.\n\n- EINVAL: used as the immediate return when path is NULL or empty. Need its definition only to understand the returned value but also to ensure no loop-related side effects.\n\n- O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC: flags passed to open/shm_open. Need to know these are compile-time macros (no runtime side effects) so they cannot violate the MISRA clauses about expressions with persistent side effects.\n\n- S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR: mode bits passed to open/shm_open; likewise, they are macros/constants with no side effects and must be known to conclude the mode expression is side-effect free.\n\n- <string.h>, <fcntl.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <sys/mman.h>, <errno.h>: the standard headers that declare the above functions/macros and specify their semantics (prototypes and side-effect behavior). For MISRA analysis we must reference the declared semantics to confirm whether any called function or macro could introduce forbidden side effects into a for-statement context.\n\nNote: metal_open contains no for loop itself. The primary purpose of the above symbols is to confirm that none of the expressions or called functions used in metal_open introduce side effects or modifications of objects that could conflict with MISRA's for-loop clause rules (in case metal_open is later inlined or used inside a for loop). If the analysis must consider callers that place metal_open inside for-loop clauses or bodies, then the callers (metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_open) and any functions they call that are invoked within for loops should also be included for a complete MISRA for-loop compliance check."
