  "explanation": "For each symbol below we need to inspect its actual definition (header/implementation) to determine whether the code relies on any compiler/language extensions (macros expanding to compiler builtins, intrinsics, thread-local extension wrappers, or non\u2011standard attributes).\n\n- O_RDWR: file\u2011status flag macro used in the bitwise OR. Verify it is a normal POSIX/system macro (constant) and not implemented via a compiler extension.\n- O_CREAT: same rationale as O_RDWR \u2014 confirm it's a plain header constant.\n- O_CLOEXEC: this flag is historically more recent and on some systems may be implemented via nonstandard macros or conditional defines; check whether its definition or use relies on compiler extensions.\n- S_IRUSR: permission mode macro \u2014 confirm a plain constant in headers, not provided via a compiler extension.\n- S_IWUSR: same as S_IRUSR.\n- EINVAL: error code macro used as a return value; verify it is a standard errno macro and not provided by a compiler extension.\n- errno: often a macro that can expand to a function (e.g. __errno_location()) or TLS object; inspect its implementation to ensure it does not depend on compiler extensions (thread\u2011local storage or compiler builtin constructs documented as extensions).\n- strlen: library function that some compilers replace with intrinsics or builtins; check whether strlen is a plain library function or an intrinsic/macro that constitutes a documented compiler extension.\n- shm_open: POSIX (or platform) API that may be provided by the C library rather than the compiler; confirm it is a standard library symbol and not implemented via a compiler extension or compiler\u2011specific attribute.\n- open: same as shm_open \u2014 confirm it is provided by the standard/system library and not a compiler extension.\n\nThe target MISRA rule concerns language/compiler extensions. To decide compliance, the next agent must be able to open the actual definitions (headers/implementations) of these macros/functions to see whether any are implemented using compiler extensions (intrinsics, builtins, special attributes, inline assembly, compiler\u2011specific TLS constructs, etc.)."
