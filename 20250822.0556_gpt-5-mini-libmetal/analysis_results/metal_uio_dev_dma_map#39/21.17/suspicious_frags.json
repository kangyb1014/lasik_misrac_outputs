  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The only such function in this function is memcpy, so only the memcpy call (and its guarding condition / size expression) needs investigation. The memcpy size argument uses nents_in (an int) multiplied by sizeof(struct metal_sg) which can provoke out-of-bounds access (or integer-to-size_t conversion issues, or negative nents_in resulting in a very large size) and memcpy is used even when sg_out != sg_in (overlap is possible even if pointers differ). Other code fragments (pointer arithmetic to compute vaddr_sg_hi and vaddr_hi, the loop that checks regions, the metal_log call, variable declarations, and comparisons) do not invoke any <string.h> routines and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated for this rule."
