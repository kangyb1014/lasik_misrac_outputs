  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to assess possible out-of-bounds use of memcpy and the pointer arithmetic in this function:\n\n1) struct metal_sg (definition)\n   - Contains the fields used in this function (virt and len) and determines sizeof(struct metal_sg). sizeof is used in the memcpy length calculation (nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg)). To prove memcpy will not access beyond sg_out or read beyond sg_in you must know the exact size and layout of this struct and the types of its fields (e.g., whether virt is void*, uintptr_t or char*). The type of virt also affects the meaning of pointer arithmetic vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len.\n\n2) struct metal_io_region (definition)\n   - Contains the fields io->virt and io->size used in the per-region bounds check. You must know their types to validate the comparisons (vaddr_sg_lo >= vaddr_lo and vaddr_sg_hi <= vaddr_hi) and to ensure the end-pointer computation vaddr_lo + io->size is correct and well-defined. If these fields are not pointer/integer types as assumed, the bounds check may be invalid.\n\n3) Definition of the type of ldev->device (the struct that declares num_regions and regions)\n   - The code iterates regions via ldev->device.regions and compares against ldev->device.num_regions. To reason about correctness you need the exact types: whether regions is an array or pointer to struct metal_io_region, and whether num_regions is the correct count type. This determines the validity of the inner loop and whether the bounds-check logic actually covers all mapped MMIO regions.\n\n4) Prototype of memcpy (from <string.h>)\n   - The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of library string functions. You must know the memcpy signature and its semantics (it does not permit overlapping buffers and copies exactly the requested number of bytes). This is needed to reason whether the provided size argument could cause reads/writes beyond the allocated extents of sg_out or sg_in.\n\n5) Caller / API contract that allocates/populates sg_in and sg_out (call sites or documentation showing how many entries are allocated for each)\n   - The function copies nents_in entries from sg_in to sg_out only when sg_out != sg_in. To ensure memcpy won't overflow sg_out (destination) or read beyond sg_in (source), you need to know how many entries were actually allocated for each buffer at the call sites or by the API contract. Without that information you cannot prove the memcpy size is safe.\n\n6) Any documented constraints or maximums for nents_in (range/valid values)\n   - The multiplication nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) could overflow an integer type or produce a size larger than the allocated buffer. To show no out-of-bounds access occurs you need the allowed range for nents_in (and whether it is non-negative and bounded) and the integer types used to carry the multiplication result (int vs size_t). This is required to prove the memcpy length is within destination/source bounds and does not overflow.\n\nThese symbols (struct definitions, caller allocation/contracts, memcpy prototype, and nents_in constraints) provide the necessary information to determine whether the memcpy call can legally access only the objects referenced by its pointer parameters, as required by the MISRA rule."
