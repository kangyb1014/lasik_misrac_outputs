  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 requires that uses of memcpy (and other <string.h> functions) must not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. In this function there is no check that sg_out points to a buffer large enough for nents_in elements (nor that sg_out is non-NULL). If sg_out != sg_in but sg_out is NULL or only allocated for fewer than nents_in elements, the memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg)) can read/write out of bounds and thus violate Rule 21.17. (Note: the function also indexes sg_in[i] earlier without validating that sg_in has at least nents_in elements, so potential out-of-bounds accesses exist regardless.)"
