  ],
  "explanation": "To decide whether the function uses a compiler language extension you must know the exact types involved in the pointer arithmetic and pointer comparisons. In this function the potentially non\u2011standard construct is arithmetic and comparisons performed on values named virt/size/len (e.g. vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len and comparisons of vaddr_sg_lo/vaddr_lo). Whether that is a use of a language extension depends entirely on the declared types of those members: \n\n- struct metal_sg (full definition): needed because sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len are used in pointer arithmetic and assignment. If virt is declared as void* then expressions like void_ptr + integer are a GNU/C extension; if virt is e.g. uintptr_t or char* the code may be standard compliant. The len member type (size_t, int, uintptr_t, etc.) also matters for the arithmetic and conversions.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (full definition): needed because io->virt and io->size are used in pointer arithmetic and comparisons with sg_in[].virt. The exact types determine whether pointer arithmetic/relational operations cross different pointer types or involve void*.\n\n- struct linux_device (full definition), specifically the type of the nested .device member, .device.num_regions and .device.regions: needed to confirm the type of regions (pointer to metal_io_region or something else) and the type of num_regions (to validate casts and loop bounds). This also ensures the comparisons (vaddr_sg_lo >= vaddr_lo, etc.) are between pointers of compatible types.\n\n- Typedefs / primitive types of virt/len/size members (if those are typedefed types): explicitly listing the underlying typedefs (e.g., whether virt is void*, char*, uintptr_t, or some integer type; whether len/size are size_t, uint32_t, int, etc.) is necessary because the MISRA check for \"language extensions\" hinges on whether the code relies on non\u2011standard behavior such as void* pointer arithmetic or pointer/integer mixing.\n\nOther symbols in the function (memcpy, METAL_LOG_WARNING, __func__, EINVAL, uint32_t) are standard library/macro items or standard language features and do not affect whether pointer arithmetic on void* (the likely extension) is being used; hence they are not required to decide this specific MISRA rule violation."
