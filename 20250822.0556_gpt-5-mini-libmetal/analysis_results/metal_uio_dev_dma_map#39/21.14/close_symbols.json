  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to analyze the MISRA C rule (memcmp on null-terminated strings):\n\n1) memcmp\n   - The MISRA rule targets use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. To determine compliance you must know whether this function (or any macro/function it calls) invokes memcmp and how it is invoked (argument types, intent). Include the memcmp symbol and its prototype/usages so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect memcmp calls and whether the operands are C strings.\n\n2) memcpy\n   - The function calls memcpy; an analyzer must distinguish memcpy from memcmp to avoid false positives. Providing memcpy's symbol/prototype clarifies that copying (not comparing) is performed and ensures no accidental confusion between the two library calls.\n\n3) struct metal_sg\n   - The function operates on sg_in/sg_out elements (sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len). The definition reveals the type of virt (e.g., char *, void *) and the semantics of len. To decide if memcmp would be comparing null-terminated strings you need to know whether these entries represent C strings or arbitrary buffers.\n\n4) struct metal_io_region\n   - The code compares sg addresses against io->virt and io->size. Knowing the types and intended semantics of io->virt and io->size (from the struct) helps establish whether the pointers manipulated are byte buffers, MMIO addresses, or strings (so whether any comparison could involve null-terminated strings).\n\n5) struct linux_device\n   - The function references ldev->device.num_regions, ldev->device.regions and ldev->dev_name. The device sub-structure layout and dev_name type are necessary to understand what kinds of pointers/strings are being passed around (e.g., dev_name is likely a C string used only for logging), and to ensure no hidden string comparisons occur via device helpers.\n\n6) metal_log\n   - metal_log is invoked for warnings. Macros or implementations of metal_log could internally use string-comparison helpers (unlikely but possible). Providing metal_log lets the analyzer inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings or otherwise mask memcmp usage.\n\n7) METAL_LOG_WARNING\n   - This logging level macro may expand in a way that invokes other helper functions/macros which could use memcmp. Including it allows inspection of any macro expansion that might introduce memcmp usage.\n\nNotes: The immediate function source contains no memcmp calls; the primary goal of the above symbols is to let the next analyzer confirm that no direct or indirect call to memcmp exists that would compare null-terminated strings, and to confirm that the pointers handled by this function represent memory regions/buffers (not C strings)."
