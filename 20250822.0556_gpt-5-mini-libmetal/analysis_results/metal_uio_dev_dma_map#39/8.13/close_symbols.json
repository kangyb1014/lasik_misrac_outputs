  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer parameter or local pointer in metal_uio_dev_dma_map can/should be changed to point-to-const (MISRA: \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\"), the analyzer needs the exact declarations/types used by the function:\n\n- struct metal_sg: The function takes sg_in and sg_out as pointers to this type and indexes sg_in[i]. We must know the types of its members (especially virt and len). If virt is declared e.g. void * vs const void *, or len is some integer type, that affects whether sg_in can be declared const struct metal_sg * (const-qualification of the pointed-to object) and whether assigning its virt member to local void * variables would drop const.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The code reads io->virt and io->size; knowing their types (void * vs const void *, size types) is needed to determine whether comparisons/assignments would violate const-correctness if local pointers or parameters were made const.\n\n- struct linux_device: The function reads ldev->device.regions, ldev->device.num_regions and ldev->dev_name. The nested device structure definition (type of regions pointer and num_regions) is required to know whether ldev can be a pointer-to-const and whether regions points to mutable entries (affecting whether the iterator io should be const pointer).\n\n- struct linux_device.device (nested): Explicit knowledge of the type of device.regions (pointer-to-what) and device.num_regions type is required to reason about the type of io (metal_io_region * vs const metal_io_region *) and whether making it const is safe.\n\n- memcpy (prototype): memcpy has signature void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n). To evaluate whether sg_in can be const and whether a const struct metal_sg * can be passed to memcpy as src without a cast, the exact parameter const-correctness of memcpy must be considered.\n\n- metal_log (prototype) and METAL_LOG_WARNING (macro/enum): metal_log is called with ldev->dev_name and vaddr_sg_lo; knowing metal_log parameter types is necessary to see if passing ldev (or its members) requires non-const access or a cast; METAL_LOG_WARNING value is not about constness but the log call signature matters.\n\n- EINVAL (macro/errno): presence/value not directly about constness, but including it ensures full type/compile-time context (error return macro).\n\nWith these declarations the next analyst can determine whether the function performs any non-const writes or implicit const-dropping assignments (e.g., assigning a const member to a non-const local pointer), and thus whether parameters/local pointers can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
