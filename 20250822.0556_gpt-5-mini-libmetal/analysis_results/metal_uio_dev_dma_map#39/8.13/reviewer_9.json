True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe fragment uses io->virt (declared as void * in struct metal_io_region) via vaddr_lo (declared as void *), and only performs read/inspection (pointer arithmetic) on it. Since the pointer is not used to modify the pointee, it should be const-qualified (e.g. const void *io->virt and const void *vaddr_lo/vaddr_hi). Because the pointee is not modified here but the declarations are non-const, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Note: if other code legitimately needs to modify the region through io->virt, making it const would be impossible and no violation would exist; based on the provided code the pointer appears read-only, so the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n...\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent's report is correct in spirit: within metal_uio_dev_dma_map the temporary pointer variables (vaddr_sg_lo, vaddr_sg_hi, vaddr_lo, vaddr_hi) are only used for inspection (comparisons and pointer arithmetic) and therefore should be declared to point to const-qualified objects (for example const void * or, better for byte-wise arithmetic, const unsigned char *). That is a direct application of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible).\n\nHowever, the agent's claim that the struct member io->virt itself must be changed to const void * is not necessarily justified solely from this function: io->virt is part of the wider API/structure and may legitimately need to be mutable in other code. If that is the case, changing the struct field would be infeasible; but that does not excuse the local function from using const-qualified local pointers where mutation is not performed. In short: there is a MISRA 8.13 issue in this function (local pointers should be const), but changing the struct definition may not be required or possible.\n\nRecommendation: declare the local temporaries as const pointers (e.g. const void *vaddr_lo, *vaddr_hi, *vaddr_sg_lo, *vaddr_sg_hi or const unsigned char * for defined byte arithmetic) to satisfy MISRA 8.13 while leaving the external struct types unchanged if needed."
