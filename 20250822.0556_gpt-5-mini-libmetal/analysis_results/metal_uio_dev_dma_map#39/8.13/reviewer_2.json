True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe struct field 'void *virt' in struct metal_io_region is used only as a base address for comparisons/arithmetics (see metal_uio_dev_dma_map, which only reads io->virt and compares ranges). Because the pointer is not used to modify the pointee in the shown use-site, it could be declared as 'const void *virt' to express non\u2011mutability. Therefore the code fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const\u2011qualified type whenever possible). Note: other pointers in the fragment (physmap) are already const\u2011qualified.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n...\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is not supported by the evidence shown. Rule 8.13 asks that a pointer should point to a const\u2011qualified type whenever that is possible for the program as a whole, but you must judge the declaration in the light of all its uses, not a single read\u2011only use site. The snippet of metal_uio_dev_dma_map only reads io->virt (uses it as a base address for comparisons/arithmetics), so at this one call site a const void * would suffice. However the declaration of struct metal_io_region::virt is part of the wider API for an I/O region (MMIO base), and such bases are normally used for reads and writes of device registers elsewhere in the code. Changing the field to const void * could prevent legitimate writes via that field (and would force casts that MISRA discourages). Given only the provided code, there is no proof that the pointer could safely be made const for the entire codebase. Therefore the report \u2014 which relies solely on this use site \u2014 is not correct."
