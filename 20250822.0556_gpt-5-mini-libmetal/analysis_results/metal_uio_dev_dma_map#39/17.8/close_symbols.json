  "explanation": "struct metal_sg: needed to know the types of the fields used (virt and len). This shows that sg_in and sg_out are pointers to element objects whose contents are read/copied \u2014 confirming any modification is to pointed-to objects (allowed), not to the pointer parameter itself. struct metal_io_region: required to know fields (virt and size) used for the address-range checks and pointer arithmetic; confirms io is a pointer into device regions (reads only). struct linux_device: needed to see the layout of ldev (device and dev_name) so we can determine that ldev is only dereferenced for reads and not assigned to. ldev->device.num_regions: explicit symbol for the loop bound; verify it is only read. ldev->device.regions: verify regions is a pointer read to obtain io; confirm the code moves a local io pointer, not the ldev parameter. ldev->dev_name: used only as a logging argument \u2014 ensure no modification to ldev occurs. memcpy: prototype/behavior is required to confirm that memcpy writes to the memory pointed to by sg_out (allowed) and does not modify the pointer parameter sg_out itself. metal_log and METAL_LOG_WARNING: logging call and log-level symbol; include to check whether the logging macro/function could have side effects that modify function parameters. EINVAL: error-code macro returned by the function (no modification concern, but needed to understand control flow on error). __func__: built-in identifier passed to logging; included to ensure no hidden modification of parameters. Together these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any parameter variables (the pointer variables sg_in, sg_out, lbus, ldev, dir, nents_in) are assigned/modified vs. only their pointee objects being read/modified."
