  "explanation": "To determine whether any controlling expression in metal_uio_dev_dma_map is invariant we must know which operands of those expressions can change during execution and whether reads are affected by qualifiers or side effects. The listed symbols are needed for that analysis:\n\n- struct metal_sg (fields: virt, len): The loop and pointer comparisons use sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len. We need the exact types and qualifiers of these members to know whether they can legally change during the loop (e.g. if declared volatile, or if their types imply different pointer/integer semantics) and how pointer arithmetic/comparison behaves.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (fields: virt, size): The inner loop compares sg addresses against io->virt and io->size. We must know the types and qualifiers of these members to determine whether those values are invariant during the inner loop iterations and whether pointer arithmetic/comparisons are well-defined.\n\n- struct linux_device (fields: device, dev_name): The code reads ldev->device.regions and ldev->dev_name; the device member contains regions and num_regions. We need the exact declaration of linux_device to find the type of device and dev_name and to trace where regions/num_regions come from.\n\n- linux_device.device.regions (type and qualifiers): The inner loop initializes io = ldev->device.regions and increments io. Knowing the type of regions (pointer type, possible aliasing, const/volatile) is necessary to decide whether the controlling expression for the inner loop (j < (int)ldev->device.num_regions) or the pointer-based comparisons can be treated as changing or invariant.\n\n- linux_device.device.num_regions (type and qualifiers): The inner loop compares j against (int)ldev->device.num_regions. We must know num_regions' type and qualifiers (e.g. volatile) to decide if its value might change during loop execution (making the controlling expression non-invariant) and whether the cast to int changes semantics.\n\n- qualifiers of all above fields (volatile/const): Volatile/const qualifiers change whether reads can be considered invariant across iterations; volatile makes a value potentially change externally and so the controlling expression would not be invariant. We need the full declarations to inspect these qualifiers.\n\n- memcpy: The function is used later to copy sg entries. While memcpy itself is not used in loop conditions, its prototype/behavior is relevant to reason about possible aliasing/side-effects outside the loops and to ensure no hidden side-effect that could change control operands.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_WARNING: metal_log is called when the inner search fails. While this call is after the loops in the failure path, metal_log's implementation might have side effects that could affect global state read by controlling expressions in other contexts; include it so the analyzer can decide whether it can affect invariance reasoning.\n\n- EINVAL: the return code used on failure; include to permit complete semantic reasoning about error paths (not needed for invariance per se but helpful for full control-flow understanding).\n\nWith these symbol definitions (in particular the exact types and qualifiers of virt/len/size/num_regions and the declarations of regions), an analyzer can decide whether the loop and conditional controlling expressions depend on values that are truly invariant or on values that may change (e.g. marked volatile or modified via aliasing/side effects)."
