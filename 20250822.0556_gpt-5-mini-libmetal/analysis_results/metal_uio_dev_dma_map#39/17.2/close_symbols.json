  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_uio_dev_dma_map violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect recursion, you must inspect every function it calls (and those functions' callees) to see if any path leads back to metal_uio_dev_dma_map. The symbols below are required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_log\n  - Reason: metal_log is called inside the error path of metal_uio_dev_dma_map. If metal_log (directly or indirectly) calls metal_uio_dev_dma_map, that would create indirect recursion. You must examine metal_log's implementation and all functions it calls transitively.\n\n- memcpy\n  - Reason: memcpy is called when copying sg entries. Although memcpy is usually a library routine that does not call back into user code, you must confirm its implementation (or any wrapper used in this build) does not call metal_uio_dev_dma_map (or call any function that eventually does). Include memcpy and its transitive callees in the inspection.\n\n- (all functions called (transitively) by metal_log)\n  - Reason: Any function reachable from metal_log could create an indirect call path back to metal_uio_dev_dma_map; they must be checked.\n\n- (all functions called (transitively) by memcpy)\n  - Reason: As above, include any functions that memcpy (or its platform-specific wrapper) calls so you can rule out indirect recursion.\n\nNotes:\n- No function pointers or callbacks are invoked in metal_uio_dev_dma_map itself (fields accessed are data), so you do not need to inspect struct member functions here unless the build replaces memcpy/metal_log with wrappers that call back into driver code.\n- Macros/constants (EINVAL, __func__) and the struct/type definitions are not needed to determine recursion; only call targets and their transitive call graphs matter for this MISRA check."
