  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains executed operations that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code: the nested loops perform region membership checks (removing them would change validation and return behavior), the metal_log call reports errors, the return -EINVAL is an error path, and the memcpy (guarded by sg_out != sg_in) copies scatter-gather entries when required. All declared variables (i, j, vaddr_*, io) are used in these checks or in computing the return value. Pointer arithmetic and comparisons determine the correctness of the MMIO address check and are not removable without changing behaviour. Therefore only the explicit (void) cast statements, which are no-op expressions used to silence unused-parameter warnings, are flagged for investigation under Rule 2.2."
