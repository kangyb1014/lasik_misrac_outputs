  "explanation": "No code fragments use any of the <string.h> functions referenced by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided consumer_thread and metal_condition_wait implementations, plus the shown symbol definitions and declarations, do not call or otherwise invoke any string-handling Standard Library functions. Therefore there are no locations in the supplied code that could violate Rule 21.17 (i.e. no potential out-of-bounds accesses originating from <string.h> function calls) and nothing needs to be investigated under this specific rule."
