  "explanation": "- metal_condition_wait: inspect its implementation to see whether it (or any functions it calls) uses any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strlen, etc.) or passes pointers to objects that could be accessed out-of-bounds. The call graph shows it calls mutex helpers, so it is the primary place to check for indirect string usage.\n- metal_condition_signal: check its implementation for any use of string.h functions or passing of pointers that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: must be examined for any direct or transitive use of string.h functions (or copying of memory) when acquiring the lock; even if trivial, verify it does not call string routines.\n- metal_mutex_release: inspect implementation for string.h usage or memory operations that could access objects out-of-bounds when releasing the lock.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: included because metal_condition_wait calls it; its implementation could contain string/memory operations relevant to the rule.\n- lock, nempty_condv, nfull_condv, counter (global variables): their declarations/types and locations in memory are needed to determine whether any of the above functions pass pointers to these objects into string.h routines or perform memory operations on them that could violate bounds. Knowing their types/definitions lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer parameters could reference buffer objects subject to the MISRA string rule.\n\nNote: also examine any transitive callees discovered inside the implementations above. If those functions call additional functions, include those symbols as well for the same reason (to find any use of <string.h> functions and verify bounds safety)."
