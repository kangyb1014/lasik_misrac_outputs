  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n- counter (global variable): The MISRA for\u2011loop rule forbids modification of the loop counter in the loop body. Although consumer_thread uses a while, any analysis checking for for\u2011loop violations must know whether 'counter' is used as a loop counter or is modified by functions called in the loop body. If called functions modify 'counter', that would matter for the rule.\n- lock (mutex object): The mutex object passed to acquire/release/condition wait is manipulated by functions in the loop body. Its type and semantics determine whether called functions have side effects that could affect loop control or other objects; needed to reason about what the called functions do to shared state.\n- nempty_condv (condition variable): The condition variable passed to metal_condition_wait is part of the called-function behaviour; its implementation may modify other objects or interact with the wait/signal semantics that influence loop control. Must inspect to see if wait/signal have side effects relevant to loop\u2011control rules.\n- nfull_condv (condition variable): metal_condition_signal is called on this object; its implementation could modify shared objects or have side effects that count as modifications inside the loop body \u2014 must be inspected.\n- metal_mutex_acquire (function prototype / implementation): Called inside the target function and by metal_condition_wait. To determine whether any function called from the loop body modifies objects other than a loop counter (or has persistent side effects), we need the implementation or contract of this function (does it modify only the mutex, does it modify other globals?).\n- metal_mutex_release (function prototype / implementation): Same rationale as acquire \u2014 it is called directly and indirectly (via condition_wait). Its side effects must be known to determine whether called functions in the loop body violate the restriction on modifying objects used in the for\u2011loop clauses.\n- metal_condition_wait (function prototype / implementation): This is invoked inside the loop body. The MISRA rule explicitly counts the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body. We must know whether condition_wait modifies any objects (e.g., the loop counter or other objects used in loop control) or has persistent side effects that would make a for\u2011loop ill\u2011formed.\n- metal_condition_signal (function prototype / implementation): Also called in the loop body. Need its semantics/implementation to know if it modifies objects that would be forbidden by the MISRA for\u2011loop constraints.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired (function prototype / implementation): Static call graph shows metal_condition_wait calls this; its behaviour could affect whether condition_wait modifies or inspects the mutex or other globals in a way that matters to rule checking.\n- types: metal_mutex_t / metal_cond_t (definitions for lock/condv types): The types and any associated inline helpers or macros may contain side effects (e.g., inline accessor macros) or reveal whether operations are simple or modify state; needed to fully understand side effects of calls.\n\nIn short: to verify MISRA\u2019s for\u2011loop constraints you must inspect not only syntactic for statements but also the behaviour (side effects) of every function called inside a loop. The listed globals and the implementations/prototypes of the mutex/condition functions are the minimal additional symbols required to determine whether any called function modifies loop counters or other objects forbidden by the rule."
