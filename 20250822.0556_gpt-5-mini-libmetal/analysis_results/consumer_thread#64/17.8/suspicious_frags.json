  "explanation": "No code fragments modify a function parameter variable itself. Analysis:\n- consumer_thread(void *arg): arg is not modified; the statement (void)arg; simply suppresses an unused-parameter warning and does not assign to arg.\n- Calls from consumer_thread (metal_mutex_acquire(&lock), metal_condition_wait(&nempty_condv, &lock), metal_condition_signal(&nfull_condv), metal_mutex_release(&lock)) pass addresses of global objects; these are not modifications of the function parameter.\n- metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv, metal_mutex_t *m): the pointer parameters cv and m are only read or used to access/modify the objects they point to. The code casts m to an integer and stores that in a local variable (mptr), and uses tmpmptr (a local) with atomic_compare_exchange_strong; neither cv nor m is assigned to. Modifications such as metal_mutex_release(m), metal_mutex_acquire(m), atomic_fetch_add/sub on cv->waiters, atomic_store/load on cv->wakeups, and writing cv->mptr affect the pointed-to objects or local variables \u2014 allowed by Rule 17.8.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
