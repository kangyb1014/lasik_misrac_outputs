  "explanation": "Only function calls (and calls inside called functions) can produce direct or indirect recursion. The fragments listed are all call sites that could participate in an indirect recursive cycle involving consumer_thread (calls to mutex/condition functions and the check that queries mutex acquisition). Other parts of the code do not perform function calls that could create recursion and therefore do not need investigation: local variable declarations and initializations (uintptr_t tmpmptr = 0, mptr, int v), atomic operations (atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add/sub), the futex syscall line (syscall(SYS_futex,...)) which is a kernel interface and cannot call back into user functions, simple control flow/returns (return 0; return NULL; the while (!counter) condition itself apart from the call it contains), and scalar/errno checks (return -EINVAL). These non-call operations cannot introduce indirect recursion and so are excluded from further investigation."
