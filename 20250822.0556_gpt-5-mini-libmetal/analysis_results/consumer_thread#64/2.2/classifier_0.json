  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The statement '(void)arg;' in consumer_thread is an executed no-op used solely to suppress an unused-parameter warning. The expression has no side-effects for the non-volatile parameter type used here, so removing it would not affect program behaviour \u2014 it therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: if the parameter were volatile, evaluation could have observable effects, but it is not in this code.)"
