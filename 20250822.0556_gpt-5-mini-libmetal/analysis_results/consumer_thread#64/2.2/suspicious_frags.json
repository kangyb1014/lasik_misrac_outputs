  "explanation": "Other code fragments should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because they perform effects that influence program behaviour or are required for correct semantics: - The mutex and condition operations (metal_mutex_acquire/release, metal_condition_wait/signal) affect synchronization and ordering; removing them would change program behaviour. - The counter increments/decrements (counter++ / counter--) modify shared state; removing them would change behaviour. - The while loops that wait on counter values control execution flow and are not dead code (they are conditional or may block). - The usleep(1) call affects timing which can affect the embedded system behaviour (note 1), so it is not dead code. - The return NULL; statements in non-void thread functions are required to provide a defined return value; removing them could produce undefined behaviour. - The declaration of the counter variable is used by producer/consumer and thus not dead. Therefore only the explicit void-cast of the unused parameter (the \u201c(void)arg;\u201d statements) are suspicious as executed statements with no side effects whose removal would not affect behaviour."
