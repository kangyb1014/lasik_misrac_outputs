  "explanation": "To decide whether consumer_thread is dead code you must determine both whether it can ever be executed and whether its actions affect program behaviour. The following additional symbols are required and why:\n\n- main: typical program entry that may create or register threads; needed to find call sites that could start consumer_thread.\n- system_init: common name for system initialization routines that may spawn threads or register callbacks referencing consumer_thread.\n- start_threads: any module-level helper that starts application threads; may be the actual caller of consumer_thread.\n- metal_thread_create: platform thread-creation API that could be passed consumer_thread as the entry function; required to find indirect calls.\n- pthread_create: another common thread-creation API; include if POSIX threads are used in the project.\n- thread_table (thread entry/registration): static tables or registration structures where thread entry points may be stored (consumer_thread could be referenced there). Necessary to locate non-callsite references.\n- producer_thread: a related thread in the call graph; it may create or interact with consumer_thread or otherwise make consumer_thread required for correct behaviour (producer/consumer semantics).\n- mutex_thread: another thread shown in the call graph; include because thread interactions can affect liveness/necessity of consumer_thread.\n- counter: global variable read and decremented by consumer_thread; have to inspect all uses to know if removing that decrement (and the thread) changes behaviour.\n- lock (mutex object): the mutex used by consumer_thread; its semantics and other users must be examined to determine side effects and timing impact of removing consumer_thread.\n- nempty_condv (condition variable): signalled/waited on by consumer_thread; other threads may depend on these signals \u2014 removing the signal/wait could change behavior.\n- nfull_condv (condition variable): signalled by consumer_thread; same rationale as nempty_condv \u2014 need to see other waiters/observers.\n- metal_condition_wait (implementation): must inspect its semantics (e.g., does it alter state, register waiters, interact with scheduler/interrupts) to see if waiting has side effects beyond blocking.\n- metal_condition_signal (implementation): signal semantics may have side effects (wakeup ordering, state changes) \u2014 required to judge whether signaling is necessary.\n- metal_mutex_acquire (implementation): mutex acquire may do more than locking (IRQ disable, bookkeeping); need to verify side effects and interaction with timing.\n- metal_mutex_release (implementation): similarly may have side-effects (IRQ restore, wakeups) relevant to behaviour/timing.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the analyzer determine: (1) whether consumer_thread is ever started or referenced (so it's reachable), and (2) whether the operations inside it (mutex ops, condition wait/signal, counter modification) have observable effects on program behaviour or timing such that removing the entire function would change the program \u2014 which is required to decide if it is dead code under MISRA."
