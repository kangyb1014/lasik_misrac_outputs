The expression has no side-effects for the non-volatile parameter type used here, so removing it would not affect program behaviour \u2014 it therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent A report is correct. The statement \"(void)arg;\" is an executed expression statement that has no side effects for the non-volatile parameter type used here and its removal would not change the program's observable behaviour; therefore it meets the rule's definition of dead code. (Note: MISRA Note 1 points out that timing can be part of observable behaviour in some embedded systems \u2014 if the project truly depends on that micro-timing then removal could affect behaviour \u2014 but nothing in the provided code or execution log indicates such timing dependence, and the cast-to-void idiom here is purely to suppress a compiler warning.)"
