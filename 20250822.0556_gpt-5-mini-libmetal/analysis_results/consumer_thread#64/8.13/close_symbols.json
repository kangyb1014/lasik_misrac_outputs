  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- lock: the actual declaration (and any const qualification on it) is needed to know whether the pointer passed (&lock) refers to a const-qualified object or a modifiable object; MISRA checks whether pointers should be to const types.\n\n- nempty_condv and nfull_condv: same as lock \u2014 their declarations/qualifications determine whether passing their addresses would violate the rule and whether they are permitted/expected to be const.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (prototype): the function parameter types (pointer-to-what and whether const-qualified) determine whether the function expects/modifies the pointed-to mutex; if the prototype already uses a non-const pointer this affects whether consumer_thread must supply a non-const object or whether the API could/should use const.\n\n- metal_condition_wait (prototype): its prototype (parameter types and const qualifiers) is required because consumer_thread calls metal_condition_wait(&nempty_condv, &lock); we must know whether those parameters are declared const-qualified (and thus whether consumer_thread is passing non-const to a const or vice versa) and whether the callee is specified to modify the referenced objects.\n\n- metal_condition_signal (prototype): its parameter types/const qualifiers show whether signaling a condition requires a modifiable condition object or can accept a pointer-to-const.\n\n- metal_mutex_release (prototype): prototype constness shows whether releasing the mutex requires a modifiable mutex object; needed to decide if &lock must be non-const.\n\n- typedef(s)/struct(s) for the mutex and condition-variable types (e.g. metal_mutex_t, metal_cond_t): the underlying type definitions are needed to inspect whether they include const in their declarations or have members that affect whether address-taking yields const-qualified pointer types; also to understand if the types are inherently mutable (e.g. contain non-const state) so that pointers to them should not be const.\n\nNote: if the prototypes already show proper const qualification, that is sufficient for the MISRA check at call sites. If prototypes use non-const pointers but you need to determine whether that is necessary, the implementation of those functions would be the next symbol(s) to inspect to see whether they actually modify the pointed-to objects. For the immediate check of consumer_thread against MISRA\u2019s pointer-to-const rule, the listed declarations/types and prototypes are the minimal required symbols."
