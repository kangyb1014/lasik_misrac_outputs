  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call metal_condition_wait(&nempty_condv, &lock) passes addresses of synchronization objects that will be modified by the wait operation (condition and mutex). Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified where possible; here the pointed-to objects must be mutable (and the function API will expect non-const pointers), so using non-const pointers is appropriate."
