  "explanation": "All pointer occurrences in the provided function body have been listed above. No other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions appear in the target code that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The remaining lines (e.g. counter-- and the while condition) operate on scalar objects, not pointers, so the rule does not apply. The related symbol definitions (METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE(lock), METAL_CONDITION_INIT) are definitions/initializers provided separately and do not introduce additional pointer expressions within the shown function body to inspect here."
