  "scenario": "No violation: metal_mutex_acquire(&lock) passes the address of a mutex object to a function that must modify the mutex state (acquire/release). Rule 8.13 recommends const-qualifying pointers when possible, but here the function needs a mutable pointer; thus using a non-const pointer is appropriate. (A violation would occur if a pointer were declared non-const but could be const-qualified, or if a function took a non-const pointer despite not modifying the pointee.)"
