  "scenario": "The call passes &nfull_condv (a mutable condition object) to metal_condition_signal. Condition-variable operations typically modify the object\u2019s internal state (wake threads, change wait lists), so the function must take a pointer to a non-const struct. Therefore the pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified and Rule 8.13 is not violated."
