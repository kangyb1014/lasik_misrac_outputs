  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is an invariant constant. The only loop control is \"while (!counter)\"; this is not a compile-time or invariant expression because counter can be modified by other threads while this thread is blocked in metal_condition_wait (the wait releases the lock), and the condition is re-evaluated on each wake-up. The loop is therefore not an infinite invariant loop and does not meet the forbidden-case in MISRA Rule 14.3. There are no do-while constructs or other loops with constant controlling expressions in the snippet. Other statements (void)arg;, mutex acquire/release, condition signal, and counter-- are not controlling expressions and do not trigger Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no fragments here that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
