  "explanation": "counter: The controlling expression is !counter. To decide if it is invariant we must know counter's declaration (type, volatile/atomic qualification, scope) and where/how it can be modified.\n\nproducer_thread: The producer is the likely modifier of counter (per the call graph). Its code shows whether and how counter is changed and whether it signals nempty_condv after updating \u2014 essential to show the while condition can become false.\n\nmetal_condition_wait: Central to the loop \u2014 must know whether it atomically releases the mutex, blocks, re-acquires the mutex on wakeup, and whether spurious wakeups are possible. These semantics determine whether counter can change while the thread is waiting and thus whether the controlling expression is non\u2011invariant.\n\nmetal_condition_signal: Understands signaling semantics (wake one vs broadcast, ordering guarantees) to determine whether a wait will be unblocked when producer updates counter.\n\nmetal_mutex_acquire / metal_mutex_release: The loop holds the mutex around the check. Knowing their semantics (whether they actually lock/unlock, errors, reentrancy) is required to reason about mutual exclusion and whether other threads can modify counter concurrently.\n\nmetal_mutex_is_acquired: Used by metal_condition_wait; its behavior may affect wait semantics and correctness of the while loop predicate re-evaluation.\n\nlock, nempty_condv, nfull_condv (objects): Their types and initialization matter to ensure condition/mutex APIs behave as expected (e.g., whether the wait implementation uses these objects correctly).\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyser determine if the while (!counter) test is genuinely invariant (a static constant) or can change because other threads (producer) and condition/mutex primitives permit modification while the consumer is waiting."
