  "explanation": "counter: The while loop predicate uses this global; you must know its definition, initial value and all writers to decide if the loop can ever terminate (if counter can never become non-zero the code after the loop is unreachable).\n\nlock: The mutex object passed to acquire/release/condition-wait. Its type/initial state and usage can affect whether the mutex operations block, assert or otherwise never return, which would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\nnempty_condv / nfull_condv: The condition-variable objects used by metal_condition_wait and metal_condition_signal. Their definitions or attributes (and how they are used elsewhere) can affect whether wait ever returns and whether signal unblocks the consumer, so they are needed to judge reachability.\n\nproducer_thread: The producer is the likely writer that modifies counter and signals the condition. You must inspect its code to see whether and how it changes counter and signals nempty_condv/nfull_condv (i.e. whether it can cause the consumer's while loop to exit).\n\nmetal_condition_wait: The call is inside the loop; you must inspect its implementation and semantics to determine whether it can block forever, fail to return, longjmp/exit, or otherwise influence reachability of following statements.\n\nmetal_condition_signal: Although typically a notifier, its implementation/semantics may affect wake-up behavior and therefore whether the consumer can progress; include to confirm it does not abort/never-return.\n\nmetal_mutex_acquire / metal_mutex_release: These synchronization primitives may block, abort, or not return in some implementations (or have side effects that affect control flow). Their definitions are required to ensure they do not make subsequent code unreachable.\n\nmetal_mutex_is_acquired: Called (transitively) by metal_condition_wait; its behavior (e.g. assertion failures) could prevent return from condition_wait, so include when analysing reachability.\n\n(Collectively these symbols provide the definitions and writers needed to determine whether the loop and/or called synchronization functions can prevent execution of the code after the loop, which is what the MISRA rule about unreachable code requires.)"
