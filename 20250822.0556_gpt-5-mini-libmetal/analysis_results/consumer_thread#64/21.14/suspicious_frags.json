  "explanation": "I inspected the provided consumer_thread function and all related definitions in the additional code (metal_condition_wait, mutex/condition macros/initializers, counter variable). There are no calls to memcmp, no indirect wrappers around memcmp, and no code that compares null\u2011terminated strings (no char* or string operations). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
