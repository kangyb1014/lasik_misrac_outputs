  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule 'Language extensions should not be used' you must examine the declarations/definitions of all external functions/macros and objects referenced by consumer_thread to see whether any use compiler extensions (macros using GCC statement-expressions, typeof, inline assembly, compiler attributes, __attribute__, __extension__, builtin extensions, non\u2011standard storage-class specifiers, etc.).\n\n- metal_condition_wait: Could be a macro or inline function that uses GCC/Clang extensions (statement-expression, typeof, __builtin_* or attributes). Its full definition is required to determine whether an extension is used.\n- metal_condition_signal: As above \u2014 may be a macro or an inline with extensions; need its definition/signature.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: Called directly; must check if it is a macro, inline function or marked with compiler-specific attributes/ABI extensions.\n- metal_mutex_release: Same reasoning as acquire \u2014 inspect for macros/attributes/extensions.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: Called (indirectly) by metal_condition_wait per call graph; its definition may reveal use of extensions required by the wait implementation.\n- lock: The mutex object used by the calls. Its type/definition (e.g., typedef, macro, volatile, __thread, attributes, or nonstandard storage) must be inspected to detect language extensions.\n- nempty_condv: The condition variable object used by metal_condition_wait \u2014 its type/definition may be a macro or otherwise defined with extensions.\n- nfull_condv: The condition variable object used by metal_condition_signal \u2014 inspect its declaration for extensions.\n- counter: Global/shared integer used in the loop condition and modified; its declaration (bit-field, atomic type, _Atomic, compiler-specific atomic, or other extension) must be checked.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions allows the next agent to determine whether any of them are implemented via language/compiler extensions (macros with nonstandard constructs, attributes, vendor builtins, inline asm, or other non\u2011standard features) that would violate the MISRA rule."
