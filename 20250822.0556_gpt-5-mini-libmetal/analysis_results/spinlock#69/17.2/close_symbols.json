  "explanation": "- metal_run: spinlock calls metal_run directly. To determine whether spinlock is (indirectly) recursive we must examine metal_run's body and its call graph.\n- metal_run_noblock: listed as a callee of metal_run in the static call graph. Any call chain through metal_run_noblock could eventually lead back to spinlock, so its implementation and callees must be examined.\n- metal_finish_threads: listed as a callee of metal_run in the static call graph. Its implementation and callees must be checked for potential return paths into spinlock (directly or via other functions).\n- spinlock_thread: passed to metal_run as the thread entry function. Threads started by metal_run will execute this function; if spinlock_thread (or any function it calls) calls spinlock (or calls metal_run which leads to spinlock), that would create indirect recursion. Therefore spinlock_thread and its callees must be inspected.\n- (all functions called, directly or indirectly, by spinlock_thread / metal_run_noblock / metal_finish_threads): Recursion can occur transitively. To prove absence of direct or indirect calls back to spinlock you must inspect the entire transitive callee set for these three entry points.\n\nIn short: to determine compliance with the MISRA rule (no direct or indirect self-calls) you need the implementations (and transitive callees) of metal_run and the functions it invokes, plus the thread function spinlock_thread and its transitive callees, so you can build a complete call graph and verify there is no path from those functions back to spinlock."
