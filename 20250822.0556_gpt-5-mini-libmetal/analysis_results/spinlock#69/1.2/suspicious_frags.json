  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Reasons: \n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT expands to {ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT}; ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT is the standard C11 atomic initializer (stdatomic.h), not a compiler-specific extension. Aggregate initialization of a struct with that macro is standard C (C11). \n- No compiler-specific keywords or constructs are present (no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions, nested functions, designated compiler pragmas, or other vendor-specific extensions). \n- Other identifiers (metal_run, metal_log, METAL_LOG_DEBUG, EINVAL) are library symbols/macros and not compiler language extensions. \nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want me to re-check against a specific compiler\u2019s documented extensions, provide the compiler name/version and its extension list."
