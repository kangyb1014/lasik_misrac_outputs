  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and whether they should be const-qualified. In this function, the only pointer-related usage is taking the address of the local 'lock' and passing it to metal_run (and the function pointer identifier spinlock_thread passed as an argument). Other lines do not declare or use pointer-to-object types: 'threads' is already const-qualified, 'value' and 'error' are plain scalars, and uses of 'total' and 'spinlock_test_count' are object accesses (not pointer declarations). Therefore those other fragments are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated here."
