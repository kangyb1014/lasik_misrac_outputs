  "explanation": "- metal_run: required to know the prototype (types of its parameters, especially the 3rd parameter) and its implementation behavior. If the 3rd parameter is a non-const void* (or a pointer to non-const), or if metal_run/its implementation writes through the pointer or passes it to callers that write, then the argument should not be const. If it accepts const void* and guarantees no modification, then the caller should pass a pointer-to-const when possible.\n- spinlock_thread: this is the thread entry function passed to metal_run. Its parameter type and body determine whether the pointed-to lock object is modified by the thread routine. If spinlock_thread mutates the object, the pointer cannot sensibly be const; if it does not, the parameter (and thus the pointer passed from spinlock) should be const-qualified.\n- metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: metal_run calls these functions; they may propagate the argument to threads or perform operations that modify the pointed-to data. Their signatures and implementations are necessary to see whether the pointer is ever used for modification inside the run/finish path.\n- struct metal_spinlock: the definition of the lock type is needed to know what members exist and whether they are intended to be modified by threads. It helps decide whether the object should be immutable/const in contexts where it is only read.\n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT: the initializer may reveal intended usage (e.g., compile-time constant initializer vs runtime state) and can indicate whether the lock instance is meant to be mutable. This affects whether passing a const-qualified pointer makes sense.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine whether the pointer passed (&lock) could or should be a pointer-to-const (per MISRA: prefer const-qualified pointer types when possible) by checking parameter types and whether any called code writes through that pointer."
