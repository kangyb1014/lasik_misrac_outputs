  "explanation": "metal_run \u2014 The target function calls metal_run; any for-loops inside metal_run (or the way it invokes the thread function) must be inspected because the behaviour of a for-loop body includes behaviour of functions called within that statement. We need the prototype/implementation to see whether it contains for loops, how it iterates (loop counters, flags), and how it calls the provided thread function.\n\nmetal_run_noblock \u2014 metal_run calls this function (per the static call graph). If metal_run delegates iteration or thread management to metal_run_noblock, that function must be inspected for for-loops and loop counter usage/side effects.\n\nmetal_finish_threads \u2014 metal_run also calls this. Any for-loops here (or loop counters modified or used) affect conformance and must be checked.\n\nspinlock_thread \u2014 This is the thread function passed to metal_run. The target itself has no for statement, but any for-loops inside spinlock_thread are part of the behaviour of the thread activity and therefore must be checked for the MISRA well-formed for-loop clauses (use/modification of loop counter, side effects in second clause, only one loop counter, modifications in body, use of objects modified in body in loop clauses, etc.).\n\ntotal \u2014 A global variable read in spinlock; if for-loops in called functions (e.g. spinlock_thread) modify or use this object, we must check whether loop clauses improperly reference objects modified in the loop body (MISRA prohibits using objects that are modified in the body in the second/third clauses). Also used to detect cross-function modification of loop counters/flags.\n\nspinlock_test_count \u2014 Another global used in the target. If used in for-loop clauses in called functions (or modified in bodies), it could violate the rule; include to see whether it participates as a loop counter or control flag.\n\nstruct metal_spinlock \u2014 The local lock variable is initialized from METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT and passed to spinlock_thread; the struct definition and its operations may be used inside called functions and could participate in loop control or be modified in loop bodies. We need its definition to determine if its members are used as loop counters/flags.\n\nMETAL_SPINLOCK_INIT \u2014 The initializer macro may expand to expressions that matter for analysis (e.g. static initializers, side effects) and to determine whether any loop counters/flags are derived from the lock state.\n\nmetal_log \u2014 Logging calls do not themselves create for-loops, but log use can indicate code paths; include its prototype/implementation if it is called inside loop bodies (e.g. for debugging) to ensure no unexpected loop-counter modifications occur via side effects.\n\nMETAL_LOG_DEBUG \u2014 The log level constant; included to understand any logging calls that may appear inside loops called from this code.\n\nEINVAL \u2014 The error macro used by the target. Include to fully understand error-returning behaviour; while not directly affecting for-loop structure, it helps assess control flows that may affect loops (early returns, loops terminated by errors).\n\nNotes: The key targets for MISRA for-loop analysis are metal_run and spinlock_thread (and any functions they call, including metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads). The listed globals (total, spinlock_test_count) and the spinlock type/initializer must be inspected to see whether they are used as loop counters or control flags or are modified in loop bodies or clauses. If further functions are discovered inside spinlock_thread or metal_run (other callees that contain for-loops), those additional symbols should also be included for a complete analysis."
