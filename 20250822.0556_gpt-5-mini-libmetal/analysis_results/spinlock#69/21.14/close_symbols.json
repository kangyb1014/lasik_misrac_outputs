  "explanation": "spinlock_thread: This thread function is passed into metal_run and may contain calls to memcmp (or comparisons of strings). Its implementation must be inspected to see if memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings.\nmetal_run: Although present in the call graph, the implementation of metal_run must be examined to discover any direct uses of memcmp and to find additional callees (beyond the static graph) that might use memcmp.\nmetal_run_noblock: A direct callee of metal_run (shown in the graph). Its body must be checked for any memcmp usage or string comparisons that would violate the MISRA rule.\nmetal_finish_threads: Another callee of metal_run; its implementation must be inspected for memcmp usage or improper comparisons of null-terminated strings.\nmemcmp: The standard library function in question \u2014 you must locate occurrences of this symbol in the above functions (and inspect the argument types and call sites) to determine whether memcmp is being (mis)used to compare null-terminated strings."
