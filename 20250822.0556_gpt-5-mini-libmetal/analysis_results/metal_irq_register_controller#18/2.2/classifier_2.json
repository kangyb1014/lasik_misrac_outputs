  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_register_controller:\n```c\nint metal_irq_register_controller(struct metal_irq_controller *cntr)\n{\n\tint irq_base;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tif (cntr == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tif (node == &cntr->node) {\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/*\n\t * Allocate IRQ numbers which are not yet used by any IRQ\n\t * controllers.\n\t */\n\tirq_base = metal_irq_allocate(cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num);\n\tif (irq_base == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tcntr->irq_base = irq_base;\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node);\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call metal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node) appends the controller node to the global irq_cntrs list as part of registration. Removing this executed operation would prevent the controller from being registered (other code traversing irq_cntrs would not see it), thus changing program behaviour. The call is reachable and not redundant, so it is not dead code."
