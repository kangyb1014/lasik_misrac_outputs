  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_register_controller:\n```c\nint metal_irq_register_controller(struct metal_irq_controller *cntr)\n{\n\tint irq_base;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tif (cntr == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tif (node == &cntr->node) {\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/*\n\t * Allocate IRQ numbers which are not yet used by any IRQ\n\t * controllers.\n\t */\n\tirq_base = metal_irq_allocate(cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num);\n\tif (irq_base == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tcntr->irq_base = irq_base;\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (node == &cntr->node) {\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the fragment only compares the loop variable 'node' to &cntr->node and returns; it does not modify the loop counter or any other object modified in the for loop body, nor does it introduce side-effects relevant to the for-loop clauses. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is not violated."
