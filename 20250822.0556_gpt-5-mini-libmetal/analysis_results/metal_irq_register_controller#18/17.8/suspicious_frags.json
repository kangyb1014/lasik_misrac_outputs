  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter itself (the pointer variable), but permits modifying the object pointed to. In this function there is no assignment to the parameter variable cntr (no statement like cntr = ...). The only modifications involving cntr are to members of the object it points to (cntr->irq_base = irq_base), and uses of the address of a member (&cntr->node) for comparison and for passing to metal_list_add_tail. These actions modify or access the pointed-to object, which is allowed by the rule. The function also checks cntr for NULL before use. Therefore there are no fragments that modify the pointer parameter itself and no violations to investigate under Rule 17.8."
