  "explanation": "Fragments not selected for investigation and why:\n- Function parameter declaration and uses: \"int metal_irq_register_controller(struct metal_irq_controller *cntr)\" and the subsequent checks/assignments involving cntr are not flagged because the function modifies the controller (cntr->irq_base is assigned and cntr->node is added to the list). Therefore the pointer must remain non-const.\n- The call to metal_irq_allocate(cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num) and the local integer irq_base are not pointers and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The assignment cntr->irq_base = irq_base; and the call metal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node); are operations that modify the list and the controller node, so pointers involved must be non-const and are not suitable for const-qualification under Rule 8.13.\n- The NULL check (if (cntr == NULL)) and the various return statements are control-flow checks and do not indicate missed const-qualification opportunities.\n- The usage of &irq_cntrs (the list head) is part of list manipulation APIs that typically require mutable pointers; treating the head as const is unlikely to be appropriate here.\n\nNo other pointer declarations or pointer parameters appear in the function; the two fragments listed above are the only places where a pointer-to-non-const might plausibly be replaced with a pointer-to-const and therefore merit investigation."
