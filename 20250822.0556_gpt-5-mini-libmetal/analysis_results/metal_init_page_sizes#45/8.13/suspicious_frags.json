  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer targets that could be const-qualified. The above fragments pass path pointers (from _metal.tmp_path and from hugetlbfs_find_path*/find_path_for_size) into metal_add_page_size; these are candidates where the pointed-to string should be const if the function does not modify it. Other parts of the function do not present pointer-to-non-const issues relevant to Rule 8.13: sizes[] is intentionally writable and therefore must be non-const; getpagesize()/gethugepagesize() return integer values (not pointers); gethugepagesizes() fills the provided array (so non-const is appropriate); qsort operates on a modifiable array (base must be non-const because qsort rearranges elements), so its usage here is not a violation of making pointers const whenever possible. Logging calls and integer computations (shifts, MAP_HUGE_MASK checks) do not involve pointer-to-object const-qualification and are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
