  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are statically invariant, so there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specific points considered:\n\n- if (sizes[0] <= 0) \u2014 sizes[0] is assigned from getpagesize() earlier in the function; this is not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (sizes[0] > 0) in the MAP_HUGE_SHIFT-not-defined branch \u2014 sizes[0] is assigned from gethugepagesize() immediately prior; not invariant.\n- if (gethugepagesize() >= 0) in the MAP_HUGE_SHIFT-defined branch \u2014 calling a function means the expression is not a constant invariant.\n- for (i = 0; i < count; i++) \u2014 loop bound count is obtained from gethugepagesizes(sizes, max_sizes); not a compile-time invariant.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HAVE_HUGETLBFS_H, #ifndef MAP_HUGE_SHIFT) are handled at translation/preprocessing time and are not subject to MISRA Rule 14.3 which addresses C controlling expressions.\n\nNo other if/while/do/for/switch controlling expressions are present that are obvious compile-time invariants (e.g., literal constants or expressions guaranteed not to change). Therefore no suspicious fragments are reported."
