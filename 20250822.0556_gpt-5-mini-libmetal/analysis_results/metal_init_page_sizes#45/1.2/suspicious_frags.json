  "explanation": "The only potential use of a compiler language extension is the array declaration using a non-constant identifier as the dimension. Declaring an automatic array with a size given by a local const int (max_sizes) is not a C90 constant expression and may be treated either as a C99 variable-length array (VLA) feature or as a compiler extension (some compilers treat a const local as non-constant and others provide extensions that accept it). All other constructs in the function are standard C or use platform APIs/macros (getpagesize, gethugepagesize, gethugepagesizes, MAP_HUGETLB, MAP_HUGE_SHIFT, qsort, sizeof, preprocessor conditionals, bitwise/shift operations, etc.) and do not constitute language extensions as documented by common compilers, so they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
