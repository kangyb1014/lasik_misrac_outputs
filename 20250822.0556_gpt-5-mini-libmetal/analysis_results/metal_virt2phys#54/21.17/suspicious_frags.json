  "explanation": "No calls to the string.h functions that accept pointer parameters (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, memcmp) appear in this function. The only string-related call is strerror(errno), which does not take a pointer parameter that could cause out-of-bounds access; it returns a pointer to an internal message string and is used only as an argument to the format string \"%s\" in metal_log. All other operations are integer/IO/bitwise and not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for this specific rule."
