  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (focused on the MISRA <string.h> rule):\n\n- _metal (struct) and fields: _metal.pagemap_fd, _metal.page_shift\n  - Required to understand the checks and arithmetic in the function (page_shift used in shifts, pagemap_fd checked for <0). Although not a string API, knowledge of page_shift and types is necessary to verify that any buffer sizes/offsets passed later (or any derived data converted to strings) cannot cause out-of-bounds string operations in callees.\n\n- strerror\n  - This is the only direct call in the function that comes from <string.h>. To decide MISRA compliance we must know its signature and behaviour (it returns a pointer to an error message string, whether it can write into a user buffer, thread-safety variant used, etc.). If the implementation returns or writes into a buffer that a subsequent call might misuse, that could trigger the rule.\n\n- metal_log (prototype and implementation)\n  - metal_log is called with the format string and strerror(errno). Many logging implementations use stdio/string functions (snprintf, strcpy, strcat, memcpy) internally. To determine whether passing the returned string (and the formatted arguments) can result in out-of-bounds string handling, we need the prototype and implementation (or at least its documented guarantees about buffer sizes / safe formatting).\n\n- pread (prototype/behavior)\n  - pread writes into the local variable 'entry'. While pread is not a <string.h> function, its behavior affects whether uninitialized/overflowed data could be produced and later handled by string functions in metal_log. Confirming the count argument and buffer address (sizeof(entry) and &entry) is important to rule out any downstream string-buffer misuse.\n\n- errno (global)\n  - errno value is passed to strerror. Knowing how errno is used/modified and its valid range helps determine whether strerror will be called with a valid code and hence whether any logging path could invoke unsafe string handling.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro)\n  - The logging level/macro may select different logging code paths or buffers inside metal_log. Different paths could use different string functions or buffer sizes; include this to know which implementation path will be used.\n\n- off_t, uintptr_t, uint64_t\n  - These types determine widths (sizes) used in arithmetic and shifts that produce values printed by metal_log. Knowing their sizes ensures format specifiers are correct and that no mistaken use of string functions (e.g., wrong-length formatting leading to buffer overrun) will occur in the logging call.\n\n- ENOENT, EINVAL (error macros)\n  - These macros are used as return values. While not directly related to <string.h>, they help understand control flow (which logging/error-reporting paths are taken) and therefore which string-handling code paths in metal_log/other callees may be exercised.\n\nIn short: the only direct <string.h> symbol invoked here is strerror, but to conclude whether any string-handling rule is violated you must also inspect metal_log (and its buffer/formatting internals) and confirm the types/values passed into it (via _metal fields, errno, and the computed values) so you can determine whether any internal use of string.h functions can access beyond object bounds."
