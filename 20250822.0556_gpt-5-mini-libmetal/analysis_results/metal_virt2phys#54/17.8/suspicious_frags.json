  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the function parameter objects themselves (i.e. reassigning addr or phys). In this function: - addr is only read and cast to uintptr_t for arithmetic; there is no assignment to addr. A cast/usage does not modify the parameter. - phys is dereferenced (*phys = ...) to modify the object it points to, which is explicitly allowed by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The pointer phys itself is not reassigned. - There are no statements that assign to addr or phys (no addr = ..., no phys = ...). - Calls (pread, metal_log) do not modify the pointer parameters in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
