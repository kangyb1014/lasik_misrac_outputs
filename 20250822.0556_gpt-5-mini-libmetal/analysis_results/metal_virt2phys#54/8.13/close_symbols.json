  "explanation": "To determine whether the pointer parameter 'void *addr' in metal_virt2phys should be const-qualified under MISRA, the analyzer must see call-sites and declarations that affect whether the pointer is intended to be modified.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: This is the direct caller of metal_virt2phys (per the static call graph). Its definition shows how the pointer argument is obtained and whether that argument is treated as mutable or as const within the caller before/after the call. If the caller passes a pointer to mutable data or subsequently modifies the pointed-to object, that affects whether metal_virt2phys can safely change its parameter to 'const void *'.\n\n- metal_shmem_open: This is the caller of metal_shmem_try_map. Tracing the full call chain (origin of the pointer) may be necessary: the original allocation/ownership/context of the pointer could require a non-const type. Inspecting metal_shmem_open (and how it obtains/passes the pointer down) helps decide if const qualification is possible across the call chain.\n\n- metal_virt2phys (declaration/signature): The function prototype/declaration as used in translation units (and any public header) is required to know the current API contract and to update it consistently if const qualification is appropriate. Also needed to check whether changing the parameter to 'const void *' would break any prototypes or linkage.\n\n- _metal (global struct/type definition): While not directly about the addr parameter, the _metal global is referenced in the function. Its definition and types (pagemap_fd, page_shift) are needed to ensure there are no hidden uses of addr via global state or side-effects that would require a non-const pointer (for example, if other functions in the same module use addr together with _metal in a way that implies modification). Including the global's definition closes that possible gap when deciding whether 'addr' can be const-qualified."
