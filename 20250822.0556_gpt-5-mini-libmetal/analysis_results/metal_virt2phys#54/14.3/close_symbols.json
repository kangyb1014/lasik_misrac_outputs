  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to judge MISRA C rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- _metal: The function reads fields from a global/extern structure named _metal. To determine whether the controlling expressions can be invariant, the analyzer must know how _metal is defined (storage duration, const/volatile qualifiers) and whether it can be modified at runtime.\n\n- _metal.pagemap_fd: Used in the controlling expression \"_metal.pagemap_fd < 0\". The analyzer must know the definition, initialization and possible mutability of this field (is it constant, set once during init, or changed elsewhere, or volatile) to decide if the comparison can be invariant.\n\n- _metal.page_shift: Used in offset calculation and the final assignment to *phys. Although not directly in an if, its value affects the semantics of the function and could be constant; the analyzer needs its definition and mutability to reason about invariance of expressions that depend on it and whether any shift-related controlling decisions are effectively invariant.\n\n- pread: The return value of pread is stored in \"error\" and tested with \"error < 0\". To decide whether that controlling expression is invariant the analyzer must know the pread prototype/semantics (return type and when it returns negative/sets errno) to determine whether the value can change at runtime.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: This function is the direct caller (per call graph). It may initialize or modify _metal (for example set pagemap_fd or page_shift) before calling metal_virt2phys. The analyzer must inspect it to determine whether the tested fields of _metal are set/changed prior to the call, which affects whether the controlling expressions within metal_virt2phys are invariant.\n\n- metal_map, metal_unmap, metal_io_init: These functions are called by metal_shmem_try_map (per call graph) and therefore may participate in initializing or modifying _metal (pagemap_fd, page_shift) or global state that affects pread behavior. They must be checked to determine if _metal fields or related state are effectively constant when metal_virt2phys runs.\n\n- errno: pread sets errno on error and strerror(errno) is used for logging. Knowing errno's declaration/semantics (extern int errno) and that pread may set it is necessary to reason about side effects of the pread call and whether the result of the subsequent comparison (error < 0) can change.\n\nNote: Other local variables (entry, error, offset, addr) and standard integer types (uintptr_t, uint64_t, off_t) are present in the function body and do not need to be listed as external symbols. Functions/macros used only for logging (metal_log, METAL_LOG_ERROR, strerror) are not required to decide whether the controlling expressions are invariant, except insofar as their callers (e.g., pread and callers that initialize _metal) affect the values tested above."
