  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_virt2phys violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls we must examine any functions that can form a call cycle with it or that it calls and which might call back into it:\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: Immediate caller of metal_virt2phys per the call graph; inspect to see if it (or functions it calls) can lead back to metal_virt2phys (indirect recursion).\n- metal_map, metal_unmap, metal_io_init: Callees of metal_shmem_try_map; they must be checked for any call paths that eventually invoke metal_virt2phys (forming an indirect recursion).\n- metal_shmem_open: Caller of metal_shmem_try_map; include to inspect upward call chains for cycles (e.g., open -> try_map -> ... -> open or -> metal_virt2phys).\n- pread: Called directly by metal_virt2phys; although a standard libc function it could be wrapped or instrumented in this codebase; verify it does not call back into project code that could reach metal_virt2phys.\n- metal_log: Called for error reporting inside metal_virt2phys; check its implementation for any callbacks or logging hooks that might transitively call project functions including metal_virt2phys.\n- strerror: Called by metal_virt2phys for error messages; include to rule out any nonstandard implementation that might call back into project code.\n\nExamining these symbols (and their callees as necessary) is sufficient to detect any direct or indirect call path that returns to metal_virt2phys and thus to determine compliance with the MISRA recursion rule."
