  "explanation": "I found no uses of the standard library function memcmp in the provided code. The atomic_thread function only performs atomic_fetch_add on an atomic_int in a simple loop; there are no string variables, no character-pointer operations, and no inclusion or calls to string.h functions in the supplied fragments. Therefore there are no places that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings) in the given code."
