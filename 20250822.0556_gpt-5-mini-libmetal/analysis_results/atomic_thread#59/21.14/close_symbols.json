  "explanation": "- atomic_fetch_add: The target function calls this symbol directly. You must inspect its implementation (or wrapper) to see whether it calls memcmp or performs string comparisons that would violate the MISRA rule.\n- atomic_int: The definition/typedef of atomic_int is needed to understand what the atomic_fetch_add implementation operates on (e.g. if it expands to a struct or wrapper that might invoke other functions that could call memcmp).\n- atomic_test_count: The global loop bound used in the target function; include its declaration/type to allow full contextual analysis (ensures no indirect string-comparison behavior via loop control or macros).\n- memcmp: The standard library function named in the MISRA rule. You need to find any call sites to memcmp (direct or indirect) reachable from atomic_thread to determine if memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- __atomic_fetch_add and __sync_fetch_and_add: Common low-level primitives or compiler-builtins that atomic_fetch_add may delegate to. Include their implementations or references so the analysis can follow transitive calls and detect any memcmp usage down the call chain."
