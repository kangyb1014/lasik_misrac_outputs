First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 in the provided function. Rationale: \n- First clause (i = 0) is an assignment that sets the loop counter, which satisfies clause 1 (an expression that sets the loop counter). \n- Second clause (i < atomic_test_count) has no persistent side effects, uses the loop counter i and a constant atomic_test_count (static const int), and does not reference any object that is modified in the loop body. atomic_test_count is const and not modified in the body. \n- Third clause (i++) modifies only the loop counter and does not use objects that are modified in the loop body. \n- There is only one loop counter (i), and i is not modified in the loop body; the only modification in the body is to *c via atomic_fetch_add, which is a different object and is not used in the for-header expressions. \n- The function-call in the body (atomic_fetch_add) does not affect the validity of the for-header with respect to Rule 14.2 because the header expressions do not depend on objects modified by that call.\nTherefore the for loop is well-formed under the stated clauses of Rule 14.2; no fragments need further inspection."
