  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the provided code. The only pointer operation is the cast from void * to atomic_int * (atomic_int *c = arg) and subsequent use of atomic_fetch_add(c, 1), which operates on a single atomic object, not a byte/character buffer; there is no buffer copying, concatenation, length computation, or pointer arithmetic that could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to string handling. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
