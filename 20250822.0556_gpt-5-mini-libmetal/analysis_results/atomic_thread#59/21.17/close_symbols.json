  "explanation": "To determine whether atomic_thread could violate the MISRA <string.h> rule you must verify that neither it nor any function it invokes uses Standard Library string functions in a way that can access beyond object bounds. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- atomic_fetch_add (definition / implementation and prototype): atomic_thread calls atomic_fetch_add. You must inspect its implementation (or the expansion if it's a macro) to see whether it calls any string.h functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/\u2026 ) or performs pointer/index operations that could produce out-of-bounds accesses. If atomic_fetch_add is a wrapper that calls other library routines, those must be inspected too.\n\n- atomic_test_count (declaration and value): the for-loop bound comes from this variable. Knowing its type and possible values is necessary to judge whether repeated calls could lead to index/length computations or loop-driven uses of string functions that exceed object bounds (for example, if a callee uses the loop count as a length parameter to memcpy/memset).\n\n- atomic_int (typedef/definition): arg is cast to atomic_int *. You must confirm the actual type/representation of atomic_int to ensure the pointer does not alias or hide a different object type (e.g., a char buffer) that later might be used with string functions, and to confirm that operations on that object in callees are type-correct and cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- Call sites that create the thread running atomic_thread (the code that allocates/passes the arg pointer): the provenance and lifetime of the object passed as arg determine whether any pointer parameters passed (directly or via callees) could reference buffers that are too small. Inspecting the thread creation sites shows what object is passed and whether other code uses that same object with string functions.\n\n- Transitive callees of atomic_fetch_add (any functions called by atomic_fetch_add): if atomic_fetch_add calls other functions, those must be inspected for string.h usage and for any pointer/length computations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nCollecting these symbols (and their definitions/implementations) lets the next analyst determine whether any string.h function is called (directly or indirectly) and whether such calls can access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters."
