  "explanation": "- atomic_int: the typedef/type of the object pointed to by the local pointer c. You must know whether atomic_int is a scalar/atomic object type (e.g. typedef atomic_int) or a typedef to a pointer type; if it were a pointer type the cast/assignment could implicitly change the semantic (would mean c points to a pointer object). This affects whether the function modifies the pointer parameter or the object it points to.\n- atomic_fetch_add: the declaration/prototype (parameter types and whether it is a macro) is required to determine what is being modified by the call. If atomic_fetch_add takes an atomic_int * it modifies the pointed-to object (allowed by MISRA), but if it took a pointer-to-pointer or had side effects on its pointer parameter that would be a modification of pointer values.\n- atomic_test_count: the declaration (type and linkage) is required to confirm the loop bound is a simple integer and that no hidden side effects or macros change the parameter. Also confirms the loop does not assign to the function parameter via a macro expansion.\n- NULL: the definition of NULL (macro) to confirm the return expression is the standard null pointer constant and has no side effects that could modify the function parameter.\n\nThese symbols provide the type and prototype information needed to decide whether only the object pointed to by the pointer parameter is modified (permitted) or whether the parameter (the pointer itself) is modified (violation)."
