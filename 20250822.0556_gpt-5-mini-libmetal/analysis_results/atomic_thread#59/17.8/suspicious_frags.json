  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter (arg). Details:\n- The statement \"atomic_int *c = arg;\" initializes a local pointer c from arg but does not modify arg itself.\n- The call \"atomic_fetch_add(c, 1);\" may modify the object pointed to by the pointer (i.e., *c), which is explicitly permitted by the rule; it does not modify the pointer parameter or arg.\n- The loop variable i and the return value (NULL) are local and do not affect the parameter.\n- There are no assignments to arg (no \"arg = ...\"), increments/decrements of arg, or other operations that would change the pointer parameter.\nTherefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, there are no suspicious fragments in the provided code."
