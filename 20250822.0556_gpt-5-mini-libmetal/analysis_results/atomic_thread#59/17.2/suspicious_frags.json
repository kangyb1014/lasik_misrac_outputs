  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The function atomic_thread does not call itself and contains no other user-defined function calls that could form an indirect recursion: it casts the argument to atomic_int* and repeatedly calls atomic_fetch_add(c, 1) inside a simple for loop, then returns NULL. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other calls in this fragment that could introduce indirect recursion. atomic_fetch_add is a standard atomic operation and (in typical implementations) will not call back into application code such as atomic_thread. Therefore no further investigation of code fragments for self- or indirect recursion is warranted based on the provided code."
