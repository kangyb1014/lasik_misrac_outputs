  "explanation": "atomic_fetch_add: atomic_thread calls this symbol in its loop. To determine whether atomic_thread violates the MISRA recursion rule you must inspect the body/definition of atomic_fetch_add to see whether it (directly) calls atomic_thread or (indirectly) calls other functions that eventually call atomic_thread.\n\n(all) transitive callees of atomic_fetch_add: if atomic_fetch_add is a wrapper or macro that forwards to compiler intrinsics or library helpers (for example __atomic_fetch_add, __sync_fetch_and_add, platform-specific helpers, or other wrapper functions), any of those transitive callees must be provided so the analyzer can compute the full call graph and detect indirect recursion back to atomic_thread. Without the full transitive set of callees you cannot conclude that atomic_thread does not (indirectly) call itself."
