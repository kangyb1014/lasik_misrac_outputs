  "explanation": "Only pointer declarations/parameters are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function signature contains a void * parameter and a void * return type \u2014 the parameter (and the local pointer initialized from it) are the primary locations where const-qualification might be applicable and thus should be investigated. Other fragments need not be investigated: the call atomic_fetch_add(c, 1) modifies the object pointed to (so a const-qualified target would be inappropriate), the loop and return NULL do not introduce pointer declarations requiring const-qualification, and atomic_test_count is already declared const. Therefore no additional code fragments contain pointers that could reasonably be made to point to a const-qualified type."
