  "explanation": "1) atomic_int: the typedef/definition of atomic_int is required to know the underlying type and qualifiers (for example whether it is _Atomic int, a typedef to int, or already has cv-qualifiers). That affects whether objects of that type can/should be referenced through a const-qualified pointer.\n\n2) atomic_fetch_add: the function prototype (parameter types and qualifiers) is required to determine whether the function writes through the pointer (i.e. whether it takes atomic_int * (non-const) or const atomic_int *). If atomic_fetch_add requires a non-const pointer (and modifies the object), then the incoming void *arg cannot be changed to a const void * without violating the call.\n\n3) atomic_test_count: declaration/type of this external variable is required so the analyzer can fully type-check the loop and compile/understand the function body. While it does not directly affect pointer constness, it is referenced by the target function and must be known for a complete static analysis of the function."
