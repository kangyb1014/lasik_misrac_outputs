  "explanation": "- atomic_int: determine whether this identifier is the C11 standard atomic typedef (from stdatomic.h/_Atomic) or a compiler/library-specific typedef or extension. If it is not the C11 standard type, the code may rely on a language/library extension.\n- atomic_fetch_add: determine whether this is the standard C11 atomic operation (provided by <stdatomic.h>) or a wrapper/macro that expands to compiler builtins or vendor extensions. The exact definition/signature is needed to decide if a language extension is used.\n- atomic_test_count: the loop bound; its declaration (type, storage, and how it is defined) is required to check whether it is a plain int, an atomic, a macro, or otherwise provided by an extension.\n- NULL: verify whether NULL is the standard macro from the C standard headers or a nonstandard definition; uncommon but a nonstandard NULL could indicate use of extensions.\n- <stdatomic.h>: the header that normally provides atomic_int and atomic_fetch_add in standard C11. Knowing whether this header is included (or whether an alternative header/implementation is used) is necessary to determine if the code uses standard C features or compiler-specific extensions.\n- __atomic_fetch_add and __sync_fetch_and_add: common compiler builtin intrinsics that atomic_fetch_add might map to. Their presence/usage in the translation unit or headers would indicate use of compiler extensions rather than the C11 standard API."
