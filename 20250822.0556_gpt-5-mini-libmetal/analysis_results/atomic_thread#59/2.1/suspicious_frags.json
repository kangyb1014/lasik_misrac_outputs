  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Rationale:\n- The variable declarations (atomic_int *c = arg; int i;) are executed on function entry and therefore reachable.\n- The for-loop header (for (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)) uses the provided compile-time constant atomic_test_count = 1000, so the loop body (atomic_fetch_add(c, 1);) is reachable and will execute 1000 times. If atomic_test_count were 0 the loop body would be skipped, but that does not make any code unreachable in the function as a whole.\n- The return statement (return NULL;) is reachable after the loop completes (or immediately if the loop body is skipped). There is no code after the return in this function that would be rendered unreachable.\n- There are no unconditional jumps (goto/longjmp), no infinite loops, no conditional blocks that are always false, and no declarations or statements in the snippet that are statically unreachable.\nGiven the provided code and symbol definitions, there is no fragment that merits further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
