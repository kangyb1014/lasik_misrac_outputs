  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of atomic_thread:\n```c\nstatic void *atomic_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\tatomic_int *c = arg;\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)\n\t\tatomic_fetch_add(c, 1);\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function atomic_thread:\nstatic const int atomic_test_count = 1000\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\treturn NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement 'return NULL;' is not dead code. atomic_thread is declared to return void *; removing the return would let control reach the end of a non-void function (undefined behaviour) and would change the program behaviour (and it also supplies the thread exit value for pthread_join). Therefore removal could affect behaviour, so this is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
