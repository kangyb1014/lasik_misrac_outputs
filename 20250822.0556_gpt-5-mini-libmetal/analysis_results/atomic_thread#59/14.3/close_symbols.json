  "explanation": "atomic_test_count: You must know its declaration/definition (type, storage class, qualifiers such as const/volatile/_Atomic, initializer and linkage). The MISRA rule hinges on whether the controlling expression i < atomic_test_count is invariant during the loop; that depends on whether atomic_test_count can change while the loop executes (modified in this thread or by other threads) or is a compile-time/const invariant.\n\natomic_int: The typedef/definition is needed to know whether the pointed-to object type is an atomic type (e.g. _Atomic int) or some other type. That affects whether writes via atomic_fetch_add are atomic/visible to other threads and whether aliasing between the thread argument and atomic_test_count is type-compatible.\n\natomic_fetch_add: The prototype and semantics (from the atomic library/header used) are required to determine what memory is modified when called (it increments *c), whether the modification is atomic, and whether such calls could reasonably modify atomic_test_count if the passed pointer aliases it. This influences whether the loop\u2019s controlling expression can change.\n\ncallers of atomic_thread (thread-creation sites and the arguments they pass): You must inspect where atomic_thread is invoked (e.g. pthread_create or other thread-start sites) and what pointer/value is passed as arg. That determines whether c inside atomic_thread can point to the same object as atomic_test_count (so the loop bound might be changed by the same threads running atomic_fetch_add).\n\nall functions/assignments that write to atomic_test_count (including other atomic_* operations): Any other locations that modify atomic_test_count during program execution must be known to conclude whether the controlling expression is invariant. This includes direct assignments, increments, or calls that may update it (possibly via aliasing)."
