  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments found. Each return is conditional and covers complementary execution paths: if cntr == NULL the function returns; otherwise execution continues. If cntr->irq_register is non-NULL the function returns there; if it is NULL execution continues to check cntr->irqs. If cntr->irqs is NULL the function returns; otherwise the final assignment and return are reachable. There are no statements that can never be executed under any possible inputs (no code following an unconditional return in the same control flow, no dead branches that are impossible to reach), so no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
