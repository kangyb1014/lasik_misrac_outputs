  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are syntactically invariant or constant in the provided code. Details per controlling statement:\n\n- metal_irq_register:\n  - if (cntr == NULL): depends on the return value of metal_irq_get_controller(irq) \u2014 a runtime value, not an invariant.\n  - if (cntr->irq_register != NULL): tests a pointer field of the controller structure; this is a runtime-dependent check, not a compile-time constant/invariant controlling expression.\n  - if (cntr->irqs == NULL): similarly depends on a structure field at runtime.\n\n- metal_irq_get_controller:\n  - metal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node): this is a loop macro that iterates a linked list. Its controlling expression is the loop iteration condition (node/list termination) and is not an invariant; it depends on the runtime list contents. If the macro were implemented as a for-loop over list nodes (the usual pattern), the condition is not constant.\n  - if (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end): depends on the runtime input irq and controller fields, not an invariant.\n\nNo do/while or while constructs with constant controlling expressions (e.g., while(1) or do { } while (0)) are present. The exceptions to Rule 14.3 (infinite loops and the specific do-while constant-false pattern) do not apply here.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
