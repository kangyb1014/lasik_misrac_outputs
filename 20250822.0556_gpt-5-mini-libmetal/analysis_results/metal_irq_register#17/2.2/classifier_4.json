Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_register:\n```c\nint metal_irq_register(int irq,\n\t\t       metal_irq_handler irq_handler,\n\t\t       void *arg)\n{\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\tstruct metal_irq *irq_data;\n\n\tcntr = metal_irq_get_controller(irq);\n\tif (cntr == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tif (cntr->irq_register != NULL) {\n\t\treturn cntr->irq_register(cntr, irq, irq_handler, arg);\n\t}\n\tif (cntr->irqs == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tirq_data = &cntr->irqs[irq - cntr->irq_base];\n\tirq_data->hd = irq_handler;\n\tirq_data->arg = arg;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_irq_register:\nmetal_log_handler handler\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (cntr->irq_register != NULL) {\n\t\treturn cntr->irq_register(cntr, irq, irq_handler, arg);\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment performs a conditional call through cntr->irq_register when a controller provides its own registration routine; removing it would change behaviour for any controller that sets irq_register. This is conditional, executed only when the pointer is non-NULL, so it is not dead code. (A possible violation scenario would be if, across the entire project, every controller either never sets cntr->irq_register or sets it to a function that has no observable effects \u2014 then the call would be executed but its removal would not affect behaviour, constituting dead code.)"
