Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_register:\n```c\nint metal_irq_register(int irq,\n\t\t       metal_irq_handler irq_handler,\n\t\t       void *arg)\n{\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\tstruct metal_irq *irq_data;\n\n\tcntr = metal_irq_get_controller(irq);\n\tif (cntr == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tif (cntr->irq_register != NULL) {\n\t\treturn cntr->irq_register(cntr, irq, irq_handler, arg);\n\t}\n\tif (cntr->irqs == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tirq_data = &cntr->irqs[irq - cntr->irq_base];\n\tirq_data->hd = irq_handler;\n\tirq_data->arg = arg;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_irq_register:\nmetal_log_handler handler\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nirq_data = &cntr->irqs[irq - cntr->irq_base];\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement irq_data = &cntr->irqs[irq - cntr->irq_base]; computes a pointer that is subsequently used to assign irq_data->hd and irq_data->arg. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (If the subsequent assignments were removed as well, then the computation could be dead, but as written there is no Rule 2.2 violation.)"
