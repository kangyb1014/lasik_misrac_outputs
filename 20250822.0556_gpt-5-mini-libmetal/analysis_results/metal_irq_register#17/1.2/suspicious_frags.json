  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code contains only standard C constructs: a normal function definition, pointer and structure accesses, pointer arithmetic, function-pointer invocation, conditional checks, and use of standard macros (NULL, -EINVAL). There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, named address spaces, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions)."
