  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_irq_register can cause out-of-bounds memory accesses (and to check any use of <string.h> functions reachable from it), the analyser needs the following symbols:\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (full definition): This structure contains the irq_register function pointer, the irqs pointer, irq_base and any fields describing the valid IRQ range. You must know the exact types and semantics of these fields to determine whether the index expression &cntr->irqs[irq - cntr->irq_base] can access beyond the allocated array and whether cntr->irq_register is invoked instead.\n\n- struct metal_irq (full definition): The target writes into irq_data->hd and irq_data->arg. The analyser needs the layout and size of struct metal_irq to ensure those stores are to valid members and do not themselves cause out-of-bounds or type/aliasing issues.\n\n- metal_irq_get_controller (definition / implementation): This callee determines which controller (if any) is returned for a given irq. Its behavior may validate the irq or map it to a controller; without its implementation you cannot conclude whether the subsequent array indexing is safe. Also inspect it for any uses of <string.h> functions that could violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_register (function-pointer type / declarations) and all functions that may be assigned to it (implementations): If cntr->irq_register is non-NULL the code calls it directly. Any implementation reachable here must be inspected for uses of <string.h> functions that could access memory out of bounds. At minimum the function-pointer prototype is needed; ideally the bodies of all functions that can be assigned to this field in the build are required.\n\n- metal_irq_handler (typedef / prototype): Knowing the handler type clarifies what irq_data->hd holds and whether assignments match expected types; also to identify handler implementations that might use <string.h> and violate the rule.\n\n- Any fields in struct metal_irq_controller that describe the irq array size or range (e.g. irq_count, num_irqs, irq_max) and definitions/allocation sites of cntr->irqs storage: To prove the index computation is within bounds you need to know how many elements cntr->irqs actually holds and where/how it is allocated/initialized.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser determine (1) whether the index into cntr->irqs can be out-of-range, and (2) whether any reachable called functions (metal_irq_get_controller or irq_register implementations) use <string.h> APIs in a way that could access beyond the bounds of their pointer parameters. Without these definitions/implementations you cannot conclusively assess compliance with the MISRA string-handling rule."
