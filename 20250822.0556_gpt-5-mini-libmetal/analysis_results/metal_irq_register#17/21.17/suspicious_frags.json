  ],
  "explanation": "This function contains no direct calls to functions from <string.h>. The checks for cntr == NULL and cntr->irqs == NULL prevent obvious NULL dereferences. The simple assignments irq_data->hd = irq_handler and irq_data->arg = arg do not perform any buffer or string operations. Therefore those other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The two reported fragments should be investigated because they involve an indirect call (which may invoke string-handling functions) and an array index calculation (which may produce an out-of-bounds access) and thus are relevant to assessing compliance with Rule 21.17."
