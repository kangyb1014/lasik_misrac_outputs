  "explanation": "To decide if metal_softirq_set_enable violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" you must know how the identifiers used in the function relate to the parameters and whether any called macros/functions could modify parameter objects. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition) \u2014 The parameter cntr is a pointer to this struct. Inspecting the struct (types and const/volatile qualifiers of irq_base and irq_num) confirms that cntr is a pointer (allowed to dereference and modify the pointed-to object) and shows whether accessing cntr->irq_base is a simple read of a member or something more complex. It also helps determine whether irq (the int parameter) could alias with members (rare but relevant for aliasing/side\u2011effect reasoning).\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled (declaration/definition) \u2014 The code indexes this global array with irq and passes its address to atomic_store. Knowing the array declaration (size, type, and linkage) is necessary to see whether indexing or atomic_store might indirectly change a parameter (e.g. via macro expansions) and to confirm that the array element is not itself the same storage as a parameter.\n\n- atomic_store (prototype or macro definition) \u2014 atomic_store may be a function or a macro. If it is a macro, it might re-evaluate its arguments or expand into code that has side effects on expressions passed (including the index expression). To determine whether any parameter (irq, enable, or cntr) could be modified by the atomic_store invocation, you must inspect its definition/signature.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE (macro or enum definition) \u2014 The comparison enable == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE drives control flow. Knowing whether METAL_IRQ_ENABLE is a simple constant or an expression/macro that could have side-effects is necessary to ensure that the comparison does not modify the enable parameter (e.g. via a bizarre macro) and to fully reason about uses of the parameter.\n\n- atomic element type used in metal_softirq_enabled (e.g. atomic_t or _Atomic int typedef/definition) \u2014 The semantics of atomic_store depend on the element type. If the element type or its accessors are implemented via macros or inline functions, those definitions could contain side effects that touch function parameters. Knowing the element type lets you locate and inspect those definitions.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine whether the function actually writes to its parameters (irq, enable, or cntr pointer) or only to local copies and pointed-to objects, and whether any called macro/function could hide modifications to the parameters."
