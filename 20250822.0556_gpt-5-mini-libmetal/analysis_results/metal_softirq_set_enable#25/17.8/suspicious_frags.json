  "explanation": "The only parameter modification in the function is the reassignment of the parameter 'irq' (irq -= cntr->irq_base;), which directly violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified). The pointer parameter 'cntr' is only dereferenced to access members (cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num) and is not reassigned, which is allowed (the object referred to by a pointer may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not). The 'enable' parameter is read-only and not modified. The atomic_store calls modify elements of metal_softirq_enabled, not any function parameters. Therefore no other fragments require investigation under Rule 17.8."
