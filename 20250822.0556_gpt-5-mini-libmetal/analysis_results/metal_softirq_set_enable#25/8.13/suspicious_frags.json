  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not declare or use pointers that could be made to point to const-qualified types. Specifically: - Local parameters irq and enable are non-pointer scalar types. - The body uses atomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], ...) where the target must be modifiable (cannot be const-qualified). - Integer members irq_base and irq_num are non-pointer types. - The node member is an embedded struct, not a pointer. - The METAL_IRQ_ENABLE macro is an integer constant, not a pointer. Therefore only the pointer-bearing declarations/signature listed above warrant further investigation for whether they could/should point to const-qualified types."
