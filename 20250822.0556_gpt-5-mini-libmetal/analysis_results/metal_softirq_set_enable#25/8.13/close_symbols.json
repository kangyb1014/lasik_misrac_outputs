  "explanation": "For deciding whether pointers in metal_softirq_set_enable could or should be const-qualified you must know the exact declarations and types used by the function:\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: needed to see the types of irq_base and irq_num and to confirm that cntr is only read (not written). If the structure is not modified by the function (and its fields are not accessed via non-const operations), the parameter could be changed to 'const struct metal_irq_controller *'.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled: you must see the declaration (array/object) and any qualifiers (const/volatile) to determine whether taking its address (&metal_softirq_enabled[irq]) and modifying the element is permitted. If it were declared const, the current atomic_store would be incorrect; if non-const, then the pointer to element cannot/should not be const if the code must store into it.\n\n- type of elements in metal_softirq_enabled (e.g., atomic_int / atomic_bool / atomic_t): atomic_store's allowed pointer type and whether writes are allowed depend on the element type. The concrete type tells you whether a const-qualified pointer would be compatible with atomic_store and whether the element type itself should/should not be const.\n\n- atomic_store (prototype): the function signature determines whether it requires a pointer to non-const atomic type (thus forbidding const qualification of the pointed-to type) or would accept a pointer-to-const (unlikely). This affects whether &metal_softirq_enabled[irq] can be const-qualified.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: its definition/type is needed to understand whether the enable parameter is used in a way that would require changing its pointee type (not directly a pointer, but included to fully understand types used in comparisons)."
