  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is invariant. The first if uses irq, cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num (all inputs/state that can vary). The second if compares the parameter enable against METAL_IRQ_ENABLE \u2014 enable is a function parameter and thus not a compile-time invariant. There are no loops with constant conditions (no infinite loops or do-while with integer constant expressions). The atomic_store calls are not control statements. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
