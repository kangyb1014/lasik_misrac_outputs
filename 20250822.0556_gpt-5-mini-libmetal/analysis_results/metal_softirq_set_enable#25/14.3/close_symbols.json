Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct metal_irq_controller: The if-condition uses cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num. To decide whether the controlling expression can be invariant you must know the types and qualifiers (const, volatile, atomic, signedness, width) of these members and whether they are compile-time constants or subject to change at runtime.\n\n2) METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: The second controlling expression compares enable against METAL_IRQ_ENABLE. You must know whether METAL_IRQ_ENABLE is a compile-time constant macro/enum or a variable/alias that could change; this affects whether the comparison can be invariant.\n\n3) All call sites of metal_softirq_set_enable: Whether the controlling expressions are effectively invariant in a program depends on the actual arguments passed for irq and enable. To determine invariance you must inspect every caller and the argument expressions (including callers' control flow that may pass fixed constants or loop-invariant values).\n\n4) metal_softirq_enabled: Knowledge of the array declaration and element type (e.g. atomic vs non-atomic, element width, storage duration) is needed when reasoning about side effects and possible aliasing that might make a previously invariant value change (or to rule out such interactions). It is also needed to understand whether indexing could be UB, which may affect whether a condition is meaningfully evaluated.\n\n5) atomic_store: The prototype and semantics are required to understand whether stores invoked here could affect visibility of state used in controlling expressions (in multi-threaded contexts) and to confirm that the call is a side effect not altering the conditions evaluated in this function. This is necessary to reason about runtime variability versus compile-time invariance."
