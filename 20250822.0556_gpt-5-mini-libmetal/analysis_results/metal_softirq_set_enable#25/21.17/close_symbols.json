This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "metal_softirq_enabled: need the declaration (is it an array or pointer, element type, and its length) to determine whether indexing with irq can produce an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access or be passed (via &metal_softirq_enabled[irq]) to another routine that might call string functions (e.g. memcpy). definition of struct metal_irq_controller (fields: irq_base, irq_num): the code ranges irq against cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num \u2014 you must know their types, signedness and semantics to confirm the bounds check actually prevents an out\u2011of\u2011bounds index into metal_softirq_enabled. atomic_store (declaration/definition/implementation): atomic_store may be a macro or wrapper that uses library primitives; some implementations use memcpy or other string.h functions internally. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls any string functions (memcpy/memmove/etc.) and what pointer/size arguments it passes so you can judge MISRA string\u2011function bounds safety. type/definition of the elements stored in metal_softirq_enabled (e.g. atomic type): the element size and representation determine what atomic_store will copy (size argument) \u2014 mismatched sizes can cause memcpy to copy past the element or use different pointer arithmetic, so this is required to reason about potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds memory accesses. METAL_IRQ_ENABLE (macro/enum definition): while not directly related to string functions, its concrete value can change which branch is taken and therefore what value is written; include it to fully understand the control flow and possible calls into atomic_store (and thus any indirect string function use)."
