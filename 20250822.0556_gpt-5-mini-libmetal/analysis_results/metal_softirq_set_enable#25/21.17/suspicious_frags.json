  "explanation": "No use of any string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the provided function. The only potentially bounds-sensitive operation is the array access metal_softirq_enabled[irq], but the function performs an explicit check: if (irq < cntr->irq_base || irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) return; followed by irq -= cntr->irq_base; which constrains irq to 0 .. cntr->irq_num-1 before the access. The atomic_store calls are not string functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: verifying the actual size of metal_softirq_enabled relative to cntr->irq_num would be a separate concern but is not related to use of <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17.)"
