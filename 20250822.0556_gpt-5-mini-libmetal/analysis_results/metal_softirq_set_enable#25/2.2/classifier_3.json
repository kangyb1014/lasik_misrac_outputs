  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_set_enable:\n```c\nstatic void metal_softirq_set_enable(struct metal_irq_controller *cntr,\n\t\t\t\t     int irq, unsigned int enable)\n{\n\tif (irq < cntr->irq_base ||\n\t    irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tirq -= cntr->irq_base;\n\tif (enable ==  METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) {\n\t\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 1);\n\t} else {\n\t\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 0);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_set_enable:\nstruct metal_irq_controller {\n\tint irq_base; /**< Start of IRQ number of the range managed by\n\t\t \t* the IRQ controller\n\t\t \t*/\n\tint irq_num; /**< Number of IRQs managed by the IRQ controller */\n\tvoid *arg; /**< Argument to pass to interrupt controller function */\n\tmetal_irq_set_enable irq_set_enable; /**< function to set IRQ enable */\n\tmetal_cntr_irq_register irq_register; /**< function to register IRQ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* handler\n\t\t\t\t\t\t*/\n\tstruct metal_list node; /**< list node */\n\tstruct metal_irq *irqs; /**< Array of IRQs managed by the controller */\n}\n...\n#define METAL_IRQ_ENABLE 1U\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (enable ==  METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) {\n\t\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 1);\n\t} else {\n\t\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 0);\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
