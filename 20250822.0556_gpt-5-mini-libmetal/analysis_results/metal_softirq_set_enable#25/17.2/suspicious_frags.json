  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. metal_softirq_set_enable contains no calls to itself and makes no calls to other potentially user-defined functions except for atomic_store. There are no invocations of function pointers (e.g., cntr->irq_set_enable is not called here), so no direct or indirect recursion can be observed from this fragment. atomic_store is from the standard atomic operations (compiler intrinsic or stdatomic.h macro) and does not invoke user-level callbacks that could recurse to metal_softirq_set_enable. Therefore no code in the provided fragment requires further investigation for Rule 17.2."
