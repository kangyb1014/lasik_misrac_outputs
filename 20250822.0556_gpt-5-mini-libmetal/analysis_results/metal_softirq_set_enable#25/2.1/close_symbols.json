  "explanation": "- struct metal_irq_controller (full definition): needed to know the types, signedness and semantic constraints of cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num. These determine the numeric range used in the if-condition (irq < irq_base || irq >= irq_base + irq_num) and whether that condition can ever be always true or always false (i.e. make subsequent code unreachable).\n- metal_softirq_enabled (declaration, element type and array size): required to verify indexing is valid and to know whether the array length matches cntr->irq_num or otherwise constrains valid irq values. If the array size or element type implies certain ranges, that can make parts of the function unreachable.\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE (macro/enum definition and value): required to determine whether the enable branch (if (enable == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) ... else ...) can ever be taken or is redundant/unreachable given possible values for enable.\n- atomic_store (declaration/definition or macro expansion): needed to see if atomic_store is a simple library call or a macro/function with control-flow effects (unlikely but must be ruled out). Its signature also confirms the element type of metal_softirq_enabled and whether the store could influence reachability analysis.\n- All call sites of metal_softirq_set_enable (caller functions and the exact expressions/values passed for 'irq' and 'enable'): MISRA unreachable-code analysis must consider how the function is used. If every caller always passes an out-of-range irq (or a constant enable), then portions of this function are unreachable. To decide that, the analyzer needs each caller and the computed/constant arguments they supply."
