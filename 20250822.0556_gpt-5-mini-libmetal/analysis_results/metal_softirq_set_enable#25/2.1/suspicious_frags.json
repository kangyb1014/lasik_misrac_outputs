  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if (enable ==  METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) {\n\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 1);\n} else {\n\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], 0);\n}",

  ],
  "explanation": "Other parts of the function were not marked for investigation because they do not by themselves indicate unreachable code: the function signature and braces are syntactically required; the adjustment 'irq -= cntr->irq_base;' is reachable exactly when the initial range check passes and therefore does not constitute dead code on its own; the atomic_store calls are contained within the conditional that is already reported. No other statements or patterns (e.g. code after an unconditional jump, unreachable labels, or obviously constant conditions within this snippet) are present that would suggest additional unreachable code. The two fragments reported above are the locations where reachability depends on external values/definitions (irq range and the value of METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) and thus should be investigated further."
