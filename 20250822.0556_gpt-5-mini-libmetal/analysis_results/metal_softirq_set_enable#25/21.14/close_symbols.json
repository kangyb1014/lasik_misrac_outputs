  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_enabled: required to determine the type and contents of the array being written. If this symbol is an array of character pointers or null-terminated strings, a memcmp usage concern could arise; if it is an array of atomic/integer types, memcmp is irrelevant. The analyzer must inspect its definition to rule out string comparisons.\n- atomic_store: the target function calls atomic_store. The analyzer must examine its declaration/definition (or macro expansion) to ensure that the called routine does not internally call memcmp (or expand to code that uses memcmp to compare strings).\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: the constant used in the comparison; inspect its definition to confirm it is not a macro that expands to a function or expression that could invoke memcmp or string handling.\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition including irq_base, irq_num): needed to know the types of irq_base and irq_num (signed/unsigned, pointer types, or aliases) to ensure no hidden string semantics or indirect calls that could lead to memcmp usage.\n- atomic_store_explicit and __atomic_store_n: atomic_store is often a macro that expands to one of these (or compiler intrinsics). Include them so the analyzer can follow macro expansion / compiler intrinsic implementations to confirm none use memcmp.\n\nThese symbols let the next agent follow all direct calls/macros and inspect data types used by metal_softirq_set_enable to conclusively determine whether any memcmp call (direct or indirect via called macros/functions) could be present, and thus whether the MISRA rule about memcmp on null-terminated strings is violated."
