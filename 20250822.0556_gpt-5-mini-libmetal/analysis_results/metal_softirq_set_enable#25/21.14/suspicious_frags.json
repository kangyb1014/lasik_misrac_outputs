  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any other standard library string comparison are present. The function performs only integer comparisons (irq range checks and enable == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) and calls atomic_store on an array indexed by irq. METAL_IRQ_ENABLE is an unsigned integer macro. There are no char pointers, no string literals being compared, and no use of <string.h> or memcmp-like functions in the supplied code fragments, so there are no places that could violate Rule 21.14 to investigate."
