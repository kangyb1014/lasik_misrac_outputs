  "explanation": "No code fragments using compiler-specific language extensions were found in the provided code. Specific reasons:\n- The function definition (static void metal_softirq_set_enable(...)) uses standard C function syntax and storage-class specifier (static).\n- Pointer dereferencing and integer arithmetic (irq -= cntr->irq_base) are standard C constructs.\n- The METAL_IRQ_ENABLE macro uses a standard unsigned integer literal suffix (1U), which is standard C.\n- The struct metal_irq_controller declaration uses standard C struct syntax and plain types; function-pointer members are standard C.\n- The usage of atomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], ...) corresponds to the C11 stdatomic.h facility (atomic_store) rather than a compiler-specific keyword; this is a standard language/library feature in C11. No compiler-specific builtins or extensions (for example identifiers beginning with __, __attribute__, __asm, typeof, or other vendor-specific keywords) are present in the supplied fragments.\n\nIf the project explicitly targets a C standard older than C11 and the build relies on a compiler-provided atomic extension, that would need separate verification against the compiler documentation. Based solely on the provided code, no explicit compiler language extensions are used, so there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
