  "explanation": "- struct linux_device: needed to know the exact type of ldev and the type/semantics of the member fd (to confirm ldev is a pointer and that accessing ldev->fd does not implicitly modify the parameter itself).\n- struct linux_bus: needed to confirm lbus is a pointer type and to ensure there are no hidden/overloaded semantics that could modify the lbus parameter when it is referenced (even though it is only cast to void here).\n- read: the function/macro prototype/definition is required to ensure that the read call cannot modify the parameter variable ldev (e.g. via macro expansion or unusual signature) and to confirm its expected side effects are limited to the buffer/FD arguments.\n- write: same as read \u2014 needed to confirm that write cannot modify the ldev/irq parameters via its implementation or via macro expansion.\n- metal_log: its declaration/definition is required to ensure the logging call (and any macros it expands to) does not perform operations that assign to or otherwise modify the function parameters.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: the macro/constant definition is required because logging macros can expand to code; confirm the expansion does not modify parameters.\n- errno: the identifier is used in the error logging call; include its definition to rule out any macro/side-effect that could modify parameters.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether any expressions or calls in the function could modify the parameter variables (lbus, ldev, irq) themselves, as opposed to the objects they point to (which is permitted by the MISRA rule)."
