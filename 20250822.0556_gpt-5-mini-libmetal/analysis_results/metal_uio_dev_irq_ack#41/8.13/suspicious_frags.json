  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - The read buffer declaration and use (unsigned int val and the read call) require a writable object (the buffer is written to), so it cannot be const-qualified. - The (void)lbus; and (void)irq; lines merely suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not involve pointer-to-non-const issues. - The ret variable and the metal_log/errno usages are not pointer declarations that could be const-qualified. - The ldev->fd argument is an integer file descriptor, not a pointer type. Therefore these other fragments are not relevant to the rule and need no further investigation."
