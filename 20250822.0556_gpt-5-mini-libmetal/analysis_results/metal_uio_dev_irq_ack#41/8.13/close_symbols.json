  "explanation": "To determine whether the pointer parameters and other pointers in metal_uio_dev_irq_ack can/should be const-qualified you need: \n\n- struct linux_device (full definition): the function dereferences ldev->fd. You must know the exact member types (name and type of fd and any mutable/volatile qualifiers) to decide whether the function only reads from the object (so ldev could be a pointer-to-const) or whether accessing that member would be invalid through a const-qualified outer pointer. \n\n- struct linux_bus (full definition): although lbus is unused in this function, MISRA requires considering whether a pointer parameter could be const-qualified. The full definition lets you check whether any future or indirect use (or aliasing rules) would prevent making lbus a const pointer. \n\n- prototype of read (ssize_t read(int, void *, size_t)): read takes a void * buffer (non-const). The buffer passed (&val) must be writable by read, so you must know read's signature to determine that the address-of val cannot be to a const-qualified object. This affects whether any local pointer could be const. \n\n- prototype of write (ssize_t write(int, const void *, size_t)): write takes a const void * buffer. Knowing this lets you determine that the object passed (&irq_info) could be a const object (or pointer-to-const) because write does not modify the buffer, and thus whether making irq_info const would comply with the MISRA pointer-const guidance. \n\nNo other symbols (metal_log, METAL_LOG_ERROR, __func__, errno) affect whether the pointer parameters or local addresses could/should be const-qualified for the MISRA rule, so they are not required for this specific const-qualification analysis."
