  "explanation": "- metal_log (definition/implementation): The target function calls metal_log to emit error messages. To determine whether the target function (via its call to metal_log) causes any out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses of objects through string.h functions, you must inspect metal_log\u2019s implementation to see whether it uses any of the forbidden string functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), how it composes messages, and whether it enforces buffer bounds.\n\n- Internal helpers called by metal_log (e.g., metal_vlog / metal_log_vsnprintf / metal_log_write): metal_log often delegates formatting and buffer handling to helper routines. Those helpers may perform string copies, concatenation, or length calculations. Their code is necessary to find any uses of the string.h functions and to verify correct length checks and limits.\n\n- Global/static log buffers and size constants used by metal_log (e.g., log buffer arrays and METAL_LOG_BUF_SIZE): If metal_log writes into a fixed buffer, you must know the buffer size and how writes are bounded to verify that any string.h calls (memcpy/strncpy/strcat/strlen, etc.) do not write or read past the buffer limits.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum): The log level / macro can change the code paths inside metal_log (for example, different formatting or routing). To ensure all code paths that might use string.h functions are examined, include the macro/enum definition so you can reason about conditional behavior.\n\n- Any call sites inside metal_log or its helpers that invoke the string.h functions listed by the MISRA rule: Direct references to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn (and where they are called) are the primary concern for this MISRA rule. You must inspect those call sites and the sizes/lengths passed to them to determine if out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses are possible.\n\n- struct linux_device definition: This confirms the type and layout of ldev and the fd member (e.g., whether fd is an int). While not directly related to string.h misuse, it completes the call-site picture for the format arguments passed to metal_log.\n\n- errno (declaration / how errno is obtained): errno is passed to metal_log in the second log call; include its declaration to ensure the formatted value is used correctly. More importantly, if metal_log inspects or stringifies errno into buffers, its handling of that conversion may involve string operations that must be checked.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyst trace whether any string.h functions are invoked (directly in metal_log or indirectly via its helpers), what buffers and sizes are involved, and whether appropriate bounds checks prevent accesses beyond object bounds as required by the MISRA rule."
