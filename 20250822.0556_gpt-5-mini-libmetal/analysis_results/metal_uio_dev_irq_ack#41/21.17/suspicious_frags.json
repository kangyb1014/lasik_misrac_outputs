  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided function. The code uses read and write (system I/O) and a cast to (void *) for read, but these are not string.h functions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Other constructs (casts, sizeof(val), &irq_info, use of errno and metal_log) do not involve the specified string-handling library functions, so they do not need investigation for this specific MISRA rule."
