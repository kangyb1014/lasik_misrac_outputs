  "explanation": "For each symbol below I state why the next analyst needs its definition/details to determine whether this function uses compiler language extensions (per the MISRA rule).\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - Need the full type definition to see if the struct itself uses any compiler extensions (attributes like __attribute__, packed, aligned, anonymous unions/structs, bit-field types with non-standard widths, or other non\u2011standard extensions).\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - The struct definition must be inspected for the same possible extensions as above (attributes, anonymous unions, bitfields, GCC extensions, etc.). Also to locate the declaration of the member fd.\n\n- ldev->fd (member/type)\n  - The exact type of fd (and any qualifiers/attributes on that member) is required to assess whether using it with read/write is employing non\u2011standard types or compiler extensions (for example if fd is declared with extension types or attributes, or as a non\u2011standard typedef).\n\n- read (function prototype)\n  - Need the declaration/signature to check whether this is the POSIX read (header, return type ssize_t, parameters) and whether that prototype or its header uses any implementation/compiler extensions (inline, attribute, non\u2011standard linkage, etc.). Using POSIX APIs is not a language extension per se, but their declarations or attributes could be compiler-specific.\n\n- write (function prototype)\n  - Same rationale as for read: the prototype and how it is declared can reveal use of non\u2011standard attributes or compiler extensions.\n\n- ssize_t\n  - The return type commonly used by read/write; its typedef origin (e.g., a signed type defined in system headers) must be checked for any non\u2011standard typedefs or attributes that are compiler extensions.\n\n- size_t\n  - The third parameter to read/write and result of sizeof use size_t; need to confirm its definition is standard and not redefined with extensions in the target environment.\n\n- errno\n  - errno may be a macro that expands to a function (e.g., thread-local accessor) or use compiler-specific constructs. Check its definition to ensure it does not rely on compiler-specific language extensions.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition)\n  - The logging call could be a macro or function. If it is a macro it might use variadic macro features or compiler-specific extensions; if a function it could be declared with attributes or non\u2011standard linkage. The declaration/definition is needed to detect such extensions.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum)\n  - If this is a macro, it may be defined using compiler extensions; even if an enum, its underlying type or attributes might matter. Need its definition to rule out non\u2011standard constructs.\n\n- __func__\n  - __func__ is implementation\u2011provided in some compilers (standard since C99, but historically an extension under some toolchains). To determine if its use constitutes a language extension in the build environment, the analyst must confirm whether the compiler documents it as standard or an extension (and/or if alternative compiler-specific identifiers like __FUNCTION__ are used)."
