  "explanation": "I examined the function for use of language/compiler extensions (examples: GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline assembler, nested functions, GCC builtins, nonstandard keywords, or compiler-specific predefined identifiers). I found none of those constructs in the supplied code. Specific notes:\n\n- __func__ is used; this is a standard identifier in C99 and later (not a compiler-specific extension).\n- (void)lbus; and (void)irq; are standard idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings (not an extension).\n- Calls to read(), write() and usage of errno are POSIX library/system calls, not language extensions.\n- The cast (void *)&val is a plain pointer cast (standard C).\n- Variable declarations and initializations used are standard C (C99/C11); they are not compiler-specific extensions.\n- No __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, statement-expressions, or other known compiler-specific constructs were present.\n\nIf you expect a specific compiler that documents any of these constructs as an extension (for example an older compiler that lacks C99 support and treats __func__ or mixed declarations as extensions), please provide that compiler and its documentation; I can re-evaluate and flag the relevant fragments accordingly."
