It is executed but has no observable effect; removing it would not change program behaviour. Therefore it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_irq_ack:\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's argument is formally correct in a very literal reading of the rule text (the expression-statement \u201c(void)irq;\u201d is executed, has no runtime effect, and removing it would not change program behaviour), but in the context of MISRA practice this is not a legitimate Rule 2.2 violation. The (void)parameter; idiom is a conventional, intentional way to document an unused parameter and to suppress compiler warnings. Rule 2.2 is intended to find genuinely superfluous code that masks faults or bloats the program, not such explicit annotations for unused parameters. If a project policy disallows that idiom, a deviation would be needed, but the mere presence of \u201c(void)irq;\u201d in this function should not be reported as a MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 violation.\n\nRecommendation: If you want to avoid the cast-to-void, consider using a compiler attribute for unused parameters or omit the parameter name in declarations where allowed; otherwise treat the cast-to-void as an acceptable annotation (or document it via an accepted deviation)."
