  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The two lines \u201c(void)lbus;\u201d and \u201c(void)irq;\u201d are the common idiom to explicitly mark parameters as unused; they perform a value computation (an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion) and therefore constitute an intentional use of the parameter to suppress unused\u2011parameter diagnostics. MISRA\u2019s intent with Rule 2.2 is to ban genuinely dead code (operations that are executed yet removable without any change in program behaviour). In practice a cast-to-void is recognized as a use (and is used to document intent), and many MISRA tool flows accept this idiom as a legitimate way to handle unused parameters. In addition, note that removal of such statements could, in theory, change timing in extremely time\u2011sensitive embedded code, so they are not unambiguously \u201cdead\u201d in the sense MISRA is concerned about. For these reasons the agent A\u2019s assertion that the function violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
