  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions (the two occurrences of 'ret < 0') are invariant you must know whether 'ret' can change at runtime. 'ret' is assigned from calls to read() and write(), so you need the actual declarations/implementations of read and write in this build to establish that they are not compile\u2011time constant/invariant functions (and to see if they can return variable results or are replaced by macros/stubs that could be constant). The definition of struct linux_device (in particular the type and qualifiers of its fd member) is required because the behaviour of read/write depends on the file descriptor type/value (and the fd field could be const or otherwise stubbed). errno is referenced in the function (in the log) and its semantics may indicate whether error reporting depends on side effects of read/write; include its declaration/semantics to be thorough. Without these symbols you cannot rule out a build-specific replacement (macro/stub/const) that would make the controlling expressions invariant."
