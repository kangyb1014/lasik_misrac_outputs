  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for reachability analysis:\n\n- metal_log (definition: function or macro): metal_log is invoked inside both error branches. If metal_log is a macro or function annotated as noreturn, or if its expansion contains control-flow altering statements (return, exit, abort, longjmp), then code following that call (or alternative branches) could be unreachable. The exact definition is needed to determine whether any path after a metal_log call is guaranteed not to be taken.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro definition/values used by metal_log): METAL_LOG_ERROR may expand to tokens that change how metal_log behaves (e.g. different macro overloads) or select a different metal_log implementation. Knowing its definition helps determine what metal_log actually does at those call sites.\n\n- read (declaration/definition or macro expansion): The code treats the return value ret and branches on ret < 0. If read is a macro that wraps code with different control flow, or if its prototype/behavior guarantees particular return values (or is annotated noreturn), that affects whether the first if (ret < 0) branch is potentially taken and thus whether subsequent code is reachable.\n\n- write (declaration/definition or macro expansion): Same reasoning as read: write's declaration/expansion and attributes (including possible noreturn or exceptional behavior) determine whether the second if (ret < 0) branch and subsequent code are reachable.\n\n- errno (macro or external variable definition): errno is used in the second error message. If errno is a macro/function with side effects or mapped to something that changes control flow, it could affect reachability. At minimum, knowing if errno is available and how it behaves is required to analyze the logging statement's potential side effects.\n\n- struct linux_device (complete definition, including member 'fd'): The function dereferences ldev->fd. The exact type of fd and any attributes on struct linux_device (for example, if it is actually a union/macro or if accessing fd triggers instrumentation or compile-time assertions) can affect whether the read/write calls are valid or removed/altered by macros. Also static annotations on the struct/pointer (non-null, const, etc.) could influence static reachability reasoning.\n\n- struct linux_bus (complete definition): Although lbus is cast to void (unused), its definition or attributes (e.g. if it is a macro that expands to something with side effects at call site, or if parameter annotations on the type affect function attributes) might affect whether the function itself can be compiled/instantiated or optimized in a way that creates unreachable code paths. Include it for completeness in case it carries attributes that influence function-level control flow analysis.\n\nNote: Standard built-ins like __func__, integer types, and sizeof are not included because they do not affect control-flow reachability. The main items of interest are any symbols (macros, functions, types) whose definitions can introduce or eliminate control flow (noreturn, exit, longjmp, macro expansions) or change the meaning of the read/write/log calls."
