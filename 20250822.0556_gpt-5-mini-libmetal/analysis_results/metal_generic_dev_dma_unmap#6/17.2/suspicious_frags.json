  "explanation": "Only code fragments that can be involved in direct or indirect recursion need investigation. The selected fragments cover the function entry (to identify the function under inspection), the loop that performs repeated operations, and the single function call present in the body. All other lines/statements do not invoke any functions and therefore cannot form direct or indirect self-calls: the variable declaration (int i;), the explicit void-casts of parameters ((void)bus; (void)device; (void)dir;), and the loop control expressions contain no function calls. There are no other call sites or function-pointer invocations in this snippet, so no other fragments can contribute to Rule 17.2 violations."
