The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "metal_cache_invalidate: The MISRA clause requires that the behaviour of the for-loop body includes called functions. You must see the implementation/prototype to determine whether it has persistent side-effects, modifies objects used in the loop condition (e.g. nents) or the loop counter (i), or writes to memory that could alias/modify sg[] entries. struct metal_sg: The loop indexes sg[i] and passes sg[i].virt and sg[i].len to the callee. You need the struct definition to know the types (pointer/integer), whether accessing those fields can have side-effects, and whether their types permit aliasing that the callee could exploit. sg (parameter declaration): Explicit parameter type (pointer qualifiers: const/volatile) may affect whether the callee may legally modify the pointed objects; qualifiers affect whether use in the second clause is permitted. nents (parameter declaration and qualifiers): Verify its type and qualifiers (e.g. volatile) and whether it can be modified by called code or aliases; the second clause must not use objects modified in the loop body. i (local loop-counter declaration): Confirm its type and scope to demonstrate there is a single loop counter and that it is not modified in the body; also to check the third clause only modifies the loop counter. Any global objects read or written by metal_cache_invalidate: If the callee modifies globals that are used in the loop condition or are loop control flags, the loop may violate the rule. Provide declarations/definitions of any such globals the callee touches so their involvement can be assessed."
