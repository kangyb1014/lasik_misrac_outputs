  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap:\n```c\nvoid metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t int nents)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\t(void)dir;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg[i].virt, sg[i].len);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Declaring the loop counter as \u2018int i;\u2019 outside the for and using \u2018for (i = 0; i < nents; i++)\u2019 complies with Rule 14.2 here: the first clause sets the loop counter, the second clause (i < nents) has no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter, and the body does not modify the loop counter. A concrete violating scenario would be if the loop counter were modified in the loop body, e.g. \u2018for (i = 0; i < nents; i++) { i += 1; }\u2019 (or using more than one loop counter in the for header), which would breach Rule 14.2."
