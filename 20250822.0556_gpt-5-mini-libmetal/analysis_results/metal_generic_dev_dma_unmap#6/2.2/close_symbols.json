  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap is dead code (its removal would not affect program behaviour) the analyser needs information beyond the body of this function. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate\n  - The function is invoked inside the loop. To know whether those calls have observable effects (and thus the loop is not dead), the analyser must examine metal_cache_invalidate's implementation and side effects (cache state, timing, hardware accesses, volatile operations, IRQ/IO effects). If metal_cache_invalidate is a no-op, the loop may be dead.\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - The function indexes sg[i].virt and sg[i].len. The definition of struct metal_sg is needed to confirm field types, sizes, and whether accessing those fields has side effects (e.g., if fields are volatile, or if sg is not a plain memory array but an accessor macro/type). Also needed to check whether nents/sg usage is well-formed.\n\n- metal_generic_dev_dma_map\n  - metal_cache_invalidate is also called by this sibling API (per call graph). Examining the map implementation helps determine whether these DMA map/unmap APIs are used together by callers; it may reveal a common call site or usage pattern that indicates unmap is reachable/used. It also helps detect symmetry/paired usage which affects whether removing unmap changes behavior.\n\n- struct metal_device\n  - The device parameter is currently unused in the function, but its type/definition is required to detect indirect references: the function pointer to this unmap implementation may be stored in device-related tables or registered with device instances. The struct definition may include pointers to ops or metadata that reference the function.\n\n- struct metal_bus\n  - Same rationale as struct metal_device: bus may carry operation tables or registration information. The type definition can show where dma_unmap implementations are wired at run-time (e.g., via bus ops), indicating if this function can be invoked indirectly.\n\n- metal_device_ops\n  - Many driver frameworks use an ops table (e.g., a struct of function pointers) containing dma_map/dma_unmap hooks. The analyser must inspect such ops table definitions and any initializers to find indirect references to metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap (function-pointer usage), which would make the function live.\n\n- metal_device_register\n  - Functions that register devices often install ops pointers or copy function pointers from generic implementations into runtime structures. Examining register routines reveals whether metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap is assigned into live device data structures and therefore reachable.\n\n- metal_driver_register\n  - Driver registration APIs are another common place where function pointers get wired into the system. Inspecting driver registration code will detect indirect references or assignments of this unmap implementation.\n\n- linker_symbol_table_or_export_list\n  - Static source-level callers may be absent, but the function could be referenced externally (other translation units, loadable modules, or by name from startup code). The symbol export/listing or linker map is needed to determine whether the function is reachable/used by other translation units or by the build (for example exported API, used by other linked modules, or referenced by name in data). Without symbol/export information one cannot conclude the function is dead.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser determine: (a) whether the body of the function has observable side effects (so its presence matters), and (b) whether there are any direct or indirect references (callers, function-pointer assignments, registration/export) that make it reachable. If both are negative, the function can be considered dead code under the MISRA rule."
