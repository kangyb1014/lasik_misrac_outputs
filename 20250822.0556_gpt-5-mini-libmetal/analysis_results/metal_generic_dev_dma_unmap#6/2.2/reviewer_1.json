  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The three lines \u201c(void)bus;\u201d, \u201c(void)device;\u201d and \u201c(void)dir;\u201d are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although these statements have no runtime effect, they are present deliberately to affect diagnostics/intent and to document API usage. Under the intent and common interpretation of MISRA Rule 2.2 this is not treated as dead code that should be removed; removing them could change static-analysis/diagnostic behaviour (and the code\u2019s clarity), so the report is not correct. If a project\u2019s interpretation of tooling requires it, such casts are an accepted way to show a parameter is used for the purpose of avoiding warnings (or can be handled via an explicit MISRA deviation), rather than being plain dead code."
