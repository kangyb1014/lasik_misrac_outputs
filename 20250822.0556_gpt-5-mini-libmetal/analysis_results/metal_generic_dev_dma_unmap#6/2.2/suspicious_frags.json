  "explanation": "Other parts of the code were not flagged because they perform observable actions or are declarations that cannot be dead code per Rule 2.2: - The for-loops that call metal_cache_invalidate (and metal_cache_flush in metal_generic_dev_dma_map) perform side effects (cache operations) and their removal would change behavior. - The conditional memcpy in metal_generic_dev_dma_map copies sg entries when sg_out differs from sg_in; removing it would change behavior. - The return of nents_in is a used result of the mapping function. - Struct definitions (metal_sg, metal_device, metal_bus, etc.) are type/data declarations, not executed operations; they are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2. - There is no obvious unreachable code elsewhere in the provided snippets. The listed fragments are the expression statements that execute but have no effect (casts to void used to silence unused-parameter warnings) and therefore should be investigated for compliance with Rule 2.2."
