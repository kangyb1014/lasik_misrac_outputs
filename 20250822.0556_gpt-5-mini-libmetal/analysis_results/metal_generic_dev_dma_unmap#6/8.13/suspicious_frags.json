  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be const-qualified. The fragments selected are the only locations in this function where pointer types (or pointer-valued expressions) appear and thus warrant checking whether they could be const-qualified. Other parts of the function do not declare or pass pointer types (e.g. uint32_t dir, int nents, int i), or are merely unused-variable casts ((void)bus; (void)device; (void)dir;) or control-flow (for loop header, braces). These non-pointer declarations and constructs are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need investigation."
