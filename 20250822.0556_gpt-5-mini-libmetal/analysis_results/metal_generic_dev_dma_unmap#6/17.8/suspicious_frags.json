  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters bus, device and dir are only cast to void to suppress unused warnings and are not assigned to or altered. The pointer parameter sg is only indexed (sg[i].virt and sg[i].len) and not reassigned or incremented; accessing or modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8, so the call metal_cache_invalidate(...) (which operates on the memory referred to by sg[i]) does not itself violate the rule. The integer parameter nents is only read in the loop condition and not modified. The local variable i is a local automatic variable and not a parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
