  "explanation": "- struct metal_sg (definition): Needed to know the types and names of the members used (virt and len) and to confirm that sg is a pointer to a struct (so sg[i].virt is an access of the pointed-to object, not an assignment to the sg parameter itself). This shows whether any expression in the function could be interpreted as modifying the parameter variable.\n- metal_cache_invalidate (prototype/definition or macro expansion): Required to see the parameter types (e.g., whether it takes a pointer, pointer-to-pointer, or is a macro that might expand to code that assigns to caller-side variables). This confirms that the call metal_cache_invalidate(sg[i].virt, sg[i].len) does not modify the pointer parameter sg itself.\n- struct metal_bus (declaration): Included to confirm bus is a pointer type and that the (void)bus; use does not trigger any hidden modification (e.g., if some macro redefines (void) or bus is a strange type). It documents the parameter type for the MISRA check.\n- struct metal_device (declaration): Same reason as struct metal_bus \u2014 to confirm device is a pointer type and that (void)device; cannot modify the parameter.\n\nThese symbols let an analyzer determine whether any parameter variable (bus, device, dir, sg, nents) is assigned to or otherwise modified in the function or via called macros/functions, which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified (the object pointed-to may be modified, but the pointer variable shall not)."
