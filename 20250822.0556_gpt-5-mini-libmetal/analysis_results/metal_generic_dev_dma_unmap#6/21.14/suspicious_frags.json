  "explanation": "No use of memcmp (or any other string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appears in the provided code. The function only calls metal_cache_invalidate(sg[i].virt, sg[i].len) over scatter-gather entries and does not perform any operations on null-terminated strings or compare character arrays. The unused-parameter casts and the integer loop/indexing are unrelated to string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
