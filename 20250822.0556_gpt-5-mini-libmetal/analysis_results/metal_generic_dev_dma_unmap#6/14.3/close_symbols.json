  "explanation": "1) metal_cache_invalidate (declaration + full definition or macro expansion): The loop body calls this function. To decide whether the controlling expression (i < nents) is invariant you must know whether this call can (a) modify the loop variables or the parameter nents (via pointer aliasing), (b) perform non-local control flow (e.g. never return, longjmp, abort), or (c) expand as a macro that contains side effects affecting i/nents. The function prototype alone is insufficient \u2014 the implementation/macro expansion is required to rule out hidden side effects that would make the control expression effectively invariant or otherwise undefined. \n\n2) struct metal_sg (complete definition): The loop indexes sg[i] and passes sg[i].len/virt into metal_cache_invalidate. The struct layout and member types are needed to reason about aliasing and object sizes/indices (could sg point into the stack or overlap the storage of nents in some call patterns), and to determine whether evaluating sg[i] can have side effects that influence loop control. \n\n3) Any macros/types used by metal_cache_invalidate (headers that define/expand it): If metal_cache_invalidate is implemented via macros or uses platform-specific inline code, those macro definitions (and any dependent types) are required to fully understand side effects and control-flow behavior used inside the loop body. Without these, you cannot conclusively determine whether the loop's controlling expression is genuinely non-invariant as required by MISRA C."
