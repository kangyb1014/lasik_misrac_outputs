  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code we must determine if any part of the function body can never be executed. The listed symbols/artefacts are needed for that analysis:\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate: needed to know its signature and attributes (in particular whether it is declared noreturn or has side-effect/optimization attributes). If metal_cache_invalidate is noreturn, subsequent iterations of the loop or any code after the call become unreachable.\n\n- declaration/attributes of metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap: visibility and attributes (e.g. static vs extern, weak, used, alias, inline) affect whether the function can be removed by the linker or is intended to be externally referenced. Attributes can also change control flow reasoning (e.g. inline or removed bodies).\n\n- project-wide callers / references to metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap: a function that has no callers within the single translation unit may still be reachable via other translation units, function-pointer tables, callbacks, or external code. A full cross-reference (or linker symbol table) is required to determine if the function is truly unreachable in the whole project.\n\n- definitions of struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: those types may contain function-pointer members or registration hooks that reference this function indirectly; their definitions help find indirect references that make the function reachable.\n\n- driver/device ops / DMA ops tables and registration code: many such APIs assign generic handler functions into ops tables at initialization. Inspecting these tables and registration code reveals indirect references (e.g., bus->dma_unmap = metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap) that make the function reachable at runtime.\n\n- build/linker map and compilation configuration: final reachability depends on linker behavior (garbage-collection of unused sections, LTO, visibility, linker scripts) and build-time preprocessor macros that may include/exclude the function. The link map and build config show whether the function is kept in the final binary and whether any external symbol resolution will make it reachable.\n\nTogether these symbols/artefacts let an analyst determine whether the function (or parts of its body) can ever execute; without them one cannot conclude the function is unreachable for the whole project."
