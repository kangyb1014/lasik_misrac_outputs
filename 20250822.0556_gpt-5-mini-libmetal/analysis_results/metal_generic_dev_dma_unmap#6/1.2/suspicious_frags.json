  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. The fragment uses only standard C constructs: typed parameters (including uint32_t from stdint.h), a plain for loop, an int loop index, and (void) casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings (a standard idiom). There are no occurrences of compiler-specific extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, nested functions, GNU statement expressions ({ ... }), label-as-value, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords. The call to metal_cache_invalidate could be a function or a macro, but neither by itself implies a compiler language extension. Therefore no code fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
