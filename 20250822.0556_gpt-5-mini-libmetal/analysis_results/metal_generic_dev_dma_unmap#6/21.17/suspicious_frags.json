  "explanation": "No direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions referenced by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear anywhere else in this function. The remaining lines ((void)bus; (void)device; (void)dir; the function signature and local declaration of i) do not invoke string.h routines and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. If further investigation is needed, it should be limited to code outside this snippet (e.g. implementations of called utilities) \u2014 there are no other in-function uses of the specified string handling functions to inspect."
