  "explanation": "metal_cache_invalidate: The target function simply forwards sg[i].virt and sg[i].len to this function. You must inspect its definition to see whether it uses any string.h functions or otherwise performs memory accesses using the provided pointer/length that could go out of bounds. struct metal_sg: You need the exact type and field types/semantics (type of virt, type and units of len) to determine what object the pointer references and what len means (bytes, elements, etc.). call sites of metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap: To determine whether the loop i < nents is safe you must see how sg and nents are produced/validated by callers (i.e., whether sg points to at least nents entries and whether each sg[].virt points to an object at least sg[].len bytes long). implementations/callees of metal_cache_invalidate: If metal_cache_invalidate calls other internal functions, those implementations must be checked for use of string.h routines or other buffer accesses that could exceed the referenced object bounds. standard string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): These are the specific library functions referenced by the MISRA rule; if any of them are invoked (directly in this translation unit or indirectly via metal_cache_invalidate or its callees), their call sites and argument relationships must be examined to decide whether they could access beyond object bounds."
