  "explanation": "- metal_run: direct callee of atomic; its implementation must be inspected because it (or functions it invokes) could call memcmp to compare strings.\n- metal_run_noblock: listed callee of metal_run in the static call graph; any memcmp use in this helper would be reachable from atomic and must be checked.\n- metal_finish_threads: listed callee of metal_run; its implementation is reachable and must be checked for memcmp usage.\n- atomic_thread: function pointer passed to metal_run (the worker thread function). The thread routine may itself call functions that use memcmp on strings, so its source must be examined.\n- metal_log: used for logging in atomic; logging wrappers sometimes use string-handling helpers\u2014inspect its implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- atomic_test_count: global used in the arithmetic check; include to confirm it is not (mis)used as or derived from a string that could be compared with memcmp.\n\nThese symbols cover all code reachable from atomic (per the provided static call graph and the thread callback) that could contain calls to memcmp comparing null-terminated strings; inspecting their definitions lets the next analyst determine any MISRA C memcmp violations."
