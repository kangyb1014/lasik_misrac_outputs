  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specific controlling constructs and why they are not suspicious:\n\n- if (!error) in atomic(): 'error' is assigned from metal_run(...) at runtime, so the condition is not invariant.\n- if (value) in atomic(): 'value' is computed at runtime (atomic_load and arithmetic), so the condition is not invariant.\n- for (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++) in atomic_thread(): although atomic_test_count is a compile-time constant (1000), the controlling expression depends on the loop variable 'i' which changes each iteration, so the expression is not invariant.\n\nNo do-while with a constant false expression or intentional infinite loops appear in the provided code. Therefore there are no controlling expressions that violate Rule 14.3 in the given fragments."
