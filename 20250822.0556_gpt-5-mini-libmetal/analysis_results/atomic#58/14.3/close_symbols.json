  "explanation": "To determine whether the controlling expressions in atomic() are invariant you must know what can change the values used in those expressions and what their initial/constant values are: \n\n- metal_run: atomic() sets error = metal_run(...); the controlling expression if (!error) is determined entirely by metal_run's return behaviour. You must inspect metal_run to know whether it can return different values at run-time (so that the condition can vary) or whether it is effectively constant for the call-site inputs.\n\n- atomic_thread: metal_run launches/executes this thread function (passed as the worker). atomic_thread is likely to modify the atomic counter or atomic_test_count. Its behaviour determines whether the counter and atomic_test_count change at run-time, which directly affects the later controlling expression if (value).\n\n- atomic_test_count: used to compute value -= atomic_test_count * threads; if atomic_test_count is a compile-time constant (or otherwise invariant) that can make the expression invariant. You need its definition and whether it is modified by threads to determine if the resulting value expression can vary.\n\n- atomic_load: the read of the counter is atomic_load(&counter). You must know the semantics/implementation of atomic_load (and whether it has side effects or always returns a constant in this environment) to decide if the loaded value can vary.\n\n- atomic_int: the type of counter; together with ATOMIC_VAR_INIT it establishes the initial state/representation of counter. Knowing the type and its semantics (and any initialisation behavior) is necessary to reason whether counter can change and thus whether the value expression is invariant.\n\n- ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: establishes the initial value of counter (here shown as ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(0)). You need to confirm that initialisation and any interactions with the thread functions mean the loaded counter value may change. If counter is never updated then the expression using its loaded value may be invariant.\n\n- EINVAL: used to set error = -EINVAL when a mismatch is detected. Knowing the actual (non-zero) value and its use is useful to reason about the !error controlling expression after the mismatch path (i.e., to know whether error becomes a constant non-zero value in all cases).\n\nSymbols not listed (metal_log, METAL_LOG_DEBUG, threads constant) are not required to decide invariance of the controlling expressions: metal_log only logs the mismatch and threads is a local const (its constness is already visible in the target). The primary question is whether the values error and value can change at runtime, which requires the symbols listed above."
