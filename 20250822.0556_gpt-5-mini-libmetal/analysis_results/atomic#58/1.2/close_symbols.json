  "explanation": "Provide the listed symbols so the next agent can determine whether compiler/language extensions are being used by the target function: \n\n- atomic_int: Determine whether this is the C11 stdatomic type (standard) or a compiler-specific typedef/macro that uses an extension. The actual typedef/definition is needed.\n- ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: This macro may expand to compiler-specific initializer sequences or builtins; inspect its definition to confirm it is standard (stdatomic.h) or an extension.\n- atomic_load: Could be a standard C11 atomic function, a macro wrapper, or a mapping to compiler builtins (__atomic_load_n/__sync). The implementation/definition is required to check for extensions.\n- atomic_test_count: Global/extern variable referenced by the function; its declaration/definition may use nonstandard attributes or types and could hide extensions.\n- metal_run: The caller in this function \u2014 its prototype and implementation must be inspected because it may use compiler extensions (inline assembly, attributes, builtin functions) that affect compliance.\n- metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: metal_run\u2019s callees (from the static call graph). metal_run may forward to them or they may reveal use of extensions; include their definitions to fully analyze metal_run for extensions.\n- metal_log: Logging helper used in the function; its declaration/definition (variadic macro/function) can use compiler extensions (variadic macros, attributes) and needs inspection.\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: Logging macro/constant \u2014 could be a macro that expands to compiler-specific code; its definition is required.\n- EINVAL: Standard errno macro \u2014 include to confirm it is the standard definition (usually from errno.h) and not redefined via extension.\n\nThese symbols (types, macros, functions and their implementations) are the relevant items that can hide compiler-specific language extensions; inspecting them is necessary to conclude whether the target function violates the MISRA rule against language extensions."
