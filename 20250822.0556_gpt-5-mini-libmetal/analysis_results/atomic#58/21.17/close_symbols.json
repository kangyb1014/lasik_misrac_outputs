  "explanation": "- atomic_thread: This is the thread entry function passed to metal_run. It must be inspected because it (or any functions it calls) might call memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc and thus could perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds string/memory accesses on the counter or other objects.\n- atomic_load: Atomic copying/reading helpers are sometimes implemented using memcpy or similar helpers. Inspecting its implementation is necessary to know whether a string/memory function is invoked and whether it could access out of bounds.\n- atomic_int and ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: The representation/layout of the atomic object can force atomic helpers to use memory-copy routines; the initializer macro/definition may hide uses of memcpy/memset that must be checked.\n- atomic_test_count: Although an integer used only for arithmetic here, include it to trace any data flow into threaded code (atomic_thread) that might use it as a length/index for string/memory operations.\n- metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: These are metal_run\u2019s callees (thread start/join logic). They must be inspected because they implement thread creation/teardown and may call helper routines that use string.h functions.\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_DEBUG: Logging helpers sometimes assemble messages using string routines or call helper functions that do; inspect metal_log to ensure no hidden string.h calls produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n- functions called by atomic_thread (closure): Any function reachable from atomic_thread must be examined recursively for use of string.h functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, etc.).\n- functions called by metal_run_noblock / metal_finish_threads (closure): Any helper called by the thread management code must also be checked for string/memory functions.\n- threading primitives used by metal_run (e.g. pthread_create, pthread_join or platform equivalents): The platform thread APIs or wrapper functions used by metal_run might call library helpers or memcpy-like functions; include them to be thorough.\n\nIn short: inspect atomic_thread and the entire call\u2011tree started by metal_run (including thread creation/join helpers and any atomic helper implementations) because the MISRA rule applies to any use of <string.h> functions in those reachable functions."
