  "explanation": "To determine whether any operation in atomic() is dead code we must know which operations can actually execute and whether their removal would change program behaviour. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- metal_run: The caller that decides whether the if (!error) block executes. If metal_run can never return 0 the whole block is dead; if it can, the block is live. You must inspect metal_run\u2019s return conditions and side-effects.\n\n- metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: metal_run\u2019s implementation may delegate to these helpers; their behaviour (return values, side-effects, thread management) influences whether metal_run can return 0 and whether threads run to completion, so they affect reachability and observable behaviour.\n\n- atomic_thread: The thread entry passed to metal_run. Its actions determine how the shared counter is updated and therefore whether the final check (value -= atomic_test_count * threads; if (value) ...) can ever be non-zero. If atomic_thread never modifies counter or always does so deterministically, that changes whether subsequent code is dead.\n\n- atomic_test_count: Global used to compute the expected counter increment. Its value (and whether it can change) determines the subtraction result; if it is always zero or set such that value is always zero, the check/log/assignment may be dead.\n\n- atomic_load: The read of counter semantics matter (atomicity and observable value). Whether atomic_load can observe changes made by threads affects the final comparison and therefore whether the logging and error assignment are ever executed.\n\n- atomic_int and ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: The counter\u2019s type and initialization influence initial state and memory model assumptions. Initialization semantics and the atomic type definition can affect whether counter changes are visible and thus whether the later arithmetic/logging are meaningful.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_DEBUG: The logging call has observable side-effects (I/O). To decide whether the log call is dead, you must know metal_log\u2019s behaviour and when it is invoked (dependent on the value check). The log-level macro identifies the log path taken.\n\n- EINVAL: The concrete error value assigned inside the branch is part of the function\u2019s externally visible behaviour (return value). Removing the assignment (or the whole branch) might change the return code; you must know the meaning/value to judge whether removing the assignment alters observable behaviour.\n\nCollectively these symbols determine (a) whether the branch is reachable, (b) whether the branch produces observable effects (logging, return value), and (c) whether removing statements would change program behaviour \u2014 all necessary to conclude if any statement is dead code under MISRA\u2019s rule."
