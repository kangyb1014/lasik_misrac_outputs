  "explanation": "To decide whether the function 'atomic' violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" you must inspect any symbols that affect how arguments are passed or mutated and any identifiers used in the body: \n\n- metal_run (declaration/prototype): shows the parameter types and calling convention of the callee. Confirming metal_run's prototype (e.g. whether it takes values or pointers and whether any parameters are passed by reference) is required to reason about whether atomic is passing or modifying any of its own parameters. Also needed to see whether any arguments are intended as output parameters (does not change that atomic itself has no parameters).\n\n- atomic_thread (declaration/prototype): the thread function pointer passed into metal_run \u2014 its prototype clarifies what is passed (e.g. void *arg) and whether the thread function could rely on or alter the object passed. Although modifications inside atomic_thread affect the object pointed-to (allowed), its signature is needed to understand parameter/argument relationships.\n\n- atomic_int (typedef/type) and ATOMIC_VAR_INIT (macro): to understand the type and initialization of 'counter' (local object) and confirm that 'counter' is not a parameter of atomic and that no hidden parameter-like behavior exists.\n\n- atomic_load (function or macro): to confirm that reading the atomic variable does not mutate any function parameter of atomic; its prototype and semantics show whether it could modify pointer parameters (unlikely but must be checked).\n\n- atomic_test_count (object): global referenced in arithmetic with value \u2014 needed to see if this is a macro/function that could have side effects that masquerade as parameter modification.\n\n- metal_log (function) and METAL_LOG_DEBUG (macro/enum): for completeness, inspect logging call semantics in case the logging macro/function alters any parameters passed by atomic (e.g. varargs wrappers). This ensures no parameter of atomic is modified via logging.\n\n- EINVAL (macro): symbolic error value used in return; included for completeness (no direct effect on the rule but needed to understand error return path).\n\nWith these symbols and their declarations/definitions available, an analyst can verify that 'atomic' has no parameters to be modified, that all objects it manipulates are locals or globals, and that none of the called/used symbols cause modification of a parameter of 'atomic' (which would be required to prove a MISRA parameter-modification violation)."
