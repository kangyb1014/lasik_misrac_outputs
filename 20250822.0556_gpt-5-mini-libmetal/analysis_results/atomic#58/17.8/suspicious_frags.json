  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in this snippet (static int atomic(void)), so there is no opportunity here to modify a function parameter. All identifiers in the body are local variables (threads, counter, value, error). Passing &counter to metal_run and to atomic_load supplies the address of a local object to other functions; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule, and this snippet does not reassign any pointer parameter variable. Assignments and updates here (error = ..., value = ..., value -= ...) act on local variables, not on function parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. (Note: the implementations of metal_run or atomic_thread are outside this snippet; if those functions reassign their own pointer parameters, those implementations would need review, but they are not part of the provided code.)"
