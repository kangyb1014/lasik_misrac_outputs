  "explanation": "To prove whether 'atomic' is (directly or indirectly) recursive you must inspect the functions it calls and the functions those call, to see if any path returns to 'atomic'.\n\n- metal_run: Called directly by 'atomic'. Its body and call graph are needed to know whether it (or anything it calls) can call back into 'atomic' (forming indirect recursion).\n- metal_run_noblock: Listed as a callee of metal_run in the static call graph. If metal_run_noblock (or its transitive callees) calls metal_run or atomic, that could close a recursion loop.\n- metal_finish_threads: Also a callee of metal_run. Its implementation and transitive callees must be checked for any calls to metal_run or atomic that would create an indirect recursion path.\n- atomic_thread: Passed to metal_run as the thread entry point. The thread function body runs under control of metal_run/metal_finish_threads; if atomic_thread (or anything it calls) invokes metal_run or atomic, that could produce indirect recursion.\n\nIn addition to these named symbols, the full transitive callee sets of metal_run, metal_run_noblock, metal_finish_threads and atomic_thread must be examined. Any function they call (recursively) that can reach back to 'atomic' would constitute an indirect self-call and thus violate the MISRA rule."
