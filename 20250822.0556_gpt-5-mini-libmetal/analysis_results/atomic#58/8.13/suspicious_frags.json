  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either (a) modify the pointed-to object (so a non-const pointer is required) or (b) do not involve pointer-to-object types that could be const-qualified. Specifically: - atomic_thread(void *arg) and the assignment atomic_int *c = arg: the thread body calls atomic_fetch_add to modify *c, so the pointee must be non-const. - The local atomic_int counter is written by threads, so passing its address requires a non-const pointer. - atomic_load/atomic_fetch_add usages operate on a mutable atomic_int, so const qualification is not appropriate. - The declaration of pthread_t tids[threads] is an array of thread IDs (not a candidate for making the array element type const here). Therefore only the listed function parameter/forwarding sites and the explicit cast to (void *) warrant further inspection to determine whether their pointer parameters could or should be const-qualified."
