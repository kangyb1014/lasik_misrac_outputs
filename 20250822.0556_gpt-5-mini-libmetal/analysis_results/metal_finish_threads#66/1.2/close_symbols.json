  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses language/compiler extensions you must inspect symbols that could introduce such extensions indirectly: \n\n- pthread_t (type definition): pthread_t may be a typedef that uses compiler-specific constructs (e.g. implementation-dependent typedefs, __attribute__, typeof, or other extensions). Knowing the exact typedef is required to detect use of non-standard language features.\n\n- pthread_join (declaration/definition): The declaration or macro/inline wrapper for pthread_join may include compiler-specific attributes or be implemented as a macro that uses extensions. Inspecting its declaration shows if any extension syntax is present.\n\n- <pthread.h> header contents: The header may contain macros, feature-test logic, or use of compiler extensions (GCC attributes, __extension__, typeof, asm, etc.) that affect whether the code relies on language extensions. The header context is necessary to detect such uses.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition): metal_log is called inside the function; its declaration or macro wrapper may be a variadic macro, use GCC extensions, or be defined using compiler-specific attributes. You must inspect it to determine if the target function relies on extension constructs.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro definition): This macro could expand to extension syntax (compiler-specific tokens, attributes, variadic macro tricks). Its definition must be checked to ensure no language extensions are used in the target function via this macro.\n\n- Build/compile-time feature macros and compiler flags: Feature-test macros (e.g. _GNU_SOURCE) or compiler command-line defines and flags can enable non-standard extensions or change header behavior. These build-time settings must be known to judge whether any extension is being used in the resulting translation unit."
