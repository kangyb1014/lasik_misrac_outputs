    "void metal_finish_threads(int threads, void *tids)",

  ],
  "explanation": "Only pointer declarations/usages that could be const-qualified are reported. The function parameter void *tids is never used to modify the pointed-at data, so it should be investigated as it could be declared const void * (or const pthread_t *). The local pointer pthread_t *tid_p and the explicit cast (pthread_t *)tids are related and should be investigated for the same reason. Other fragments (the null check if (!tids), the metal_log call, the loop and the pthread_join call) do not affect whether the pointer should be const-qualified: they either perform reads/joins or error reporting and do not modify the objects pointed to, so they do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
