  "explanation": "- pthread_t (typedef): To determine the precise pointed-to type (and whether const-qualification is meaningful/allowed) you must know the concrete definition of pthread_t. Some typedefs can affect how const is interpreted; include the pthread_t typedef so the analyzer can reason about const-applicability.  \n- pthread_join (function prototype): metal_finish_threads obtains values via tid_p[i] and passes them to pthread_join. The prototype shows whether pthread_join expects a pointer or a value and whether it could implicitly modify the pointed-to object (e.g., if it took a pointer). Confirming that pthread_join takes pthread_t by value (not a pointer) demonstrates that metal_finish_threads does not modify the tids array via that call, supporting qualification to const.  \n- condition (caller) \u2014 prototype and implementation: One must inspect callers to see how they construct and pass the tids argument (e.g., as an array of pthread_t, as a pointer to mutable storage, or with casts). This shows whether changing the parameter to a pointer-to-const would break any caller expectations or usages.  \n- metal_run (caller) \u2014 prototype and implementation: Same rationale as for condition: analyze how metal_run invokes metal_finish_threads and whether it relies on the function being able to modify the tids buffer (or expects non-const).  \nIncluding these symbols (pthread typedef/prototype plus the caller declarations/implementations) is sufficient to decide if the tids parameter (or the derived pthread_t *tid_p) can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule (i.e., that the function never writes through the pointer and callers remain compatible)."
