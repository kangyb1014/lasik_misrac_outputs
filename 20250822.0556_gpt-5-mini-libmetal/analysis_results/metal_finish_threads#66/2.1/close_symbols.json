  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_finish_threads (and any code inside it) is unreachable you must trace call paths from program entry points down to that function. The following symbols are required for that reachability analysis:\n\n- condition: Direct caller of metal_finish_threads (per the static call graph). You must inspect condition to see whether it can be invoked at runtime or is itself unreachable.\n\n- metal_run: Direct caller of metal_finish_threads. You must inspect metal_run to determine whether it is called and under what circumstances it calls metal_finish_threads.\n\n- metal_run_noblock: Appears in the same call graph as a callee of condition and metal_run. Including it is necessary to fully explore alternate call paths and control flow between those components that could affect reachability of metal_finish_threads.\n\n- atomic, mutex, shmem, spinlock: These are listed as callers of metal_run. To decide whether metal_run (and thus metal_finish_threads) is reachable you must inspect these callers to see if any of them are reachable from program entry and invoke metal_run.\n\n- main: An explicit program entry point (or any other known entry points) is required to start the reachability analysis. You must know which top-level entry(s) call into the subsystem that contains the above symbols; otherwise you cannot conclude whether the code is unreachable in the whole project.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next analyzer trace call chains from program entry(s) through the callers/callees to establish whether metal_finish_threads (and any internal statements) can be executed at runtime, which is necessary to verify the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
