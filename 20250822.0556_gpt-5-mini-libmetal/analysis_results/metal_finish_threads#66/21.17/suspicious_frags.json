  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided fragments. The function metal_finish_threads only casts a void* to pthread_t* and calls pthread_join; this does not involve string handling and therefore is not relevant to Rule 21.17. The helper functions shown (metal_run, condition) allocate and pass pthread_t arrays and call metal_finish_threads but contain no string.h usage. The macro metal_log and the symbol metal_fmt(fmt) are referenced but their implementations are not provided; since no string.h functions are visible in the supplied code, they cannot be flagged here. If metal_fmt or the log handler use any of the listed string functions, those implementations should be inspected separately, but they are not part of the provided code and so are not included as suspicious fragments for Rule 21.17."
