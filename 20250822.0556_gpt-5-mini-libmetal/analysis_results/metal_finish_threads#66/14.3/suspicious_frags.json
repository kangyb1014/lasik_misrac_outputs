  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Analysis of the control constructs:\n\n- metal_finish_threads: the for loop uses the loop index i (for (i = 0; i < threads; i++)), so the controlling expression i < threads depends on the changing variable i and is not invariant. The preceding if (!tids) depends on the function parameter tids and is not a compile-time or loop-invariant expression.\n\n- condition and metal_run (additional code): there are no do/while or for/while constructs with constant or compile-time invariant conditions. All if statements and the calls to metal_finish_threads depend on runtime values (ret, tids, ts_created, etc.) and are therefore not invariant.\n\n- There are no explicit infinite-loop constructs (e.g., for(;;) or while(1)) or do-while constructs with a constant false controlling expression that would require applying the listed exceptions.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments in the supplied code that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
