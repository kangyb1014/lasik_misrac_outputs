  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression (i < threads) is invariant you must know what value or expression is passed as the threads argument at all call sites. The two functions in the static call graph that call metal_finish_threads are therefore required: \n\n- condition: This caller may pass a literal, a constant/macro, a global, or a computed value for the threads parameter. Examining condition\u2019s call sites to metal_finish_threads is necessary to determine whether the threads argument can be an invariant (constant) or varies at runtime.\n\n- metal_run: Same reason \u2014 metal_run is a caller that supplies the threads parameter. You must inspect how metal_run computes or sources that argument (literal, const, variable, global, etc.) to know whether the loop controlling expression can be invariant.\n\n(If those callers in turn use other symbols or macros to construct the threads value, include those symbols as well when inspecting the callers.)"
