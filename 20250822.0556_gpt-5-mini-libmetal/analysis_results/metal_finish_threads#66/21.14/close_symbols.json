  "explanation": "memcmp \u2014 the Standard Library function being restricted by the MISRA rule; check for any direct use in this function or in functions it calls. metal_log \u2014 metal_finish_threads calls metal_log; metal_log\u2019s implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. METAL_LOG_ERROR \u2014 the log level/macro passed into metal_log; its definition or expansion could expand into code that uses string comparisons (macros sometimes wrap helper functions), so inspect it. pthread_join \u2014 a callee of the target; although a system call it should be checked (or at least considered) for any indirect use of memcmp in linked code or wrappers. pthread_t \u2014 the type used for the tids cast; include its definition to rule out any hidden macro or inline behavior that could perform string comparisons. NULL \u2014 the null pointer constant is used in the pthread_join call; include its definition to ensure there are no non-standard macros that expand to code that compares strings with memcmp."
