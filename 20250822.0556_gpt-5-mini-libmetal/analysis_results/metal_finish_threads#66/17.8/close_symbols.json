  "explanation": "pthread_t: You must know the concrete typedef/representation of pthread_t (from pthread.h) to understand what tid_p points to and what tid_p[i] yields. If pthread_t is itself a pointer type vs an integer type affects whether indexing/reads are pointer operations or produce pointer values, and whether passing tid_p[i] to pthread_join could implicitly pass an address that might be modified by the callee. pthread_join: You must see the prototype/signature of pthread_join to determine whether the thread argument is passed by value or by pointer (e.g. pthread_t vs pthread_t *). If pthread_join takes a pointer it could modify the object referred-to by tid_p (which is allowed by the MISRA rule), whereas if it takes the thread by value it cannot modify the tids parameter itself. Knowing the exact prototype also shows that the function is not writing back into the tids parameter variable (the rule forbids modifying the parameter variable itself)."
