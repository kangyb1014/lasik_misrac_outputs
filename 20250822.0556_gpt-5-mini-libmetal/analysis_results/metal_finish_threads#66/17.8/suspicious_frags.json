  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the code. The parameter 'threads' is only read in the for-loop condition and never assigned to. The parameter 'tids' is only tested for NULL and cast to a local pointer (pthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids); this assigns the parameter value to a local variable but does not modify the parameter itself. Dereferencing tid_p (tid_p[i]) and passing the value to pthread_join operates on the object pointed to (which is allowed by the rule) and does not change the pointer parameter. The (void) cast is used to discard pthread_join's return value and does not modify any parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
