The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For a MISRA check about well-formed for loops we must be sure that nothing used in metal_map (macros, functions or types) can itself hide or expand into a for loop or otherwise affect the presence/behaviour of loop counters in this translation unit. Each listed symbol is required as follows:\n\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: macros used to build the prot argument passed to mmap. Confirm they are simple integer constants (not macros that expand to code containing for loops).\n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: mapping flag macros combined and reassigned in the function. Need their definitions to ensure they are simple constants (not code/macros with control flow or loops).\n- MAP_FAILED: returned value compared against mmap result. Ensure it is a simple constant ((void *) -1) and not an expression hiding loops.\n- errno: used and negated for error returns (-errno). Need to know errno is a simple modifiable integer location (not a macro that expands to function calls or loops).\n- flock, LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN: flock() is called; LOCK_EX/LOCK_UN are constants passed. We must inspect flock\u2019s declaration/implementation (or confirm it is a library/syscall wrapper) to ensure it is a function call (no macro that could expand into code containing for loops) and does not introduce for-loops into the body of metal_map by macro expansion.\n- fstat and struct stat (st_size): fstat() is called and the code accesses stat.st_size. Confirm fstat is a function (not a macro) and struct stat is an ordinary POD type; ensure no macros expand into for-loops.\n- ftruncate: called when expanding the file. Verify it is a function (not a macro) and does not involve macro expansions that would introduce loop constructs visible in metal_map.\n- mmap: the central mapping call; need its declaration/definition form (typically a library/syscall wrapper) to confirm it is a function and not a macro that could hide a for loop.\n- off_t, size_t: types used for offset and size. Confirm they are types (not macros) and do not hide constructs with loops.\n\nIn short, to conclude metal_map contains no for-loop violations we must inspect the definitions/declarations of the above macros, functions and types to ensure none are macros or inline constructs that expand into for loops or otherwise change the control-flow/loop-counter semantics inside metal_map."
