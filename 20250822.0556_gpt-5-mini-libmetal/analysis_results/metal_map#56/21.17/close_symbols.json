  "explanation": "For verifying whether metal_map itself can violate the MISRA C rule on string functions (out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by functions in <string.h>), you must inspect all symbols that affect pointer/size computation, returned pointers and error handling inside this function and any macros/wrappers that could expand to or call string functions.\n\n- mmap: returns the mapped pointer assigned to *result; must be inspected to see if any wrapper/macro in scope could involve string functions or alter pointer semantics.\n- MAP_FAILED: used to detect mapping failure; needed to verify correct error handling and that no dereference of MAP_FAILED (invalid pointer) occurs.\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: mapping protection flags affect how the mapping will be used; included to confirm no implicit string operations are introduced via alternate definitions.\n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: mapping flags chosen based on fd; we must confirm these macros do not hide code that could call string functions or affect mapping semantics that could lead to bounded access issues.\n- ftruncate: called to extend the file to reqsize; affects the file size that is later mmap'ed \u2014 required to reason about whether the mapped region's size (size parameter) matches the backing object and whether subsequent accesses could go out of bounds.\n- fstat: used to read stat.st_size; needed to determine current file size and to check correctness of the resize logic that influences the mapping length.\n- struct stat and stat.st_size: the code compares stat.st_size to reqsize; you must know the type/meaning of st_size to reason about overflow/underflow or incorrect comparisons that could lead to mapping of wrong sizes and thus out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n- flock, LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN: used to serialize the resize sequence; include them to ensure locking wrappers or macros do not introduce hidden string usage and to check that error handling around locking does not leave size/state inconsistent.\n- errno: used to translate syscall failures into return values; required to confirm error paths are handled without performing any string operations or misinterpreting error semantics that could cause invalid pointer use.\n- off_t: type of offset and reqsize calculation (offset + size); needed to check for integer overflow when computing reqsize which could result in mapping a wrong size and hence potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by callers.\n- size_t: size parameter type \u2014 relevant for overflow/underflow and for verifying the correctness of the length passed to mmap.\n- void **result: the out parameter receiving the mapped pointer; include to verify how the returned pointer is produced and whether any subsequent dereference or use within this function (none) or via macros could produce string operations that access beyond bounds.\n\nNote: The target function contains no direct calls to the <string.h> functions. The listed symbols are those whose definitions/implementations, macros or interactions could affect pointer/size values or hide calls to string functions; they must be checked to conclude definitively that no string function is invoked or that no out\u2011of\u2011bounds access can result from this function's behavior."
