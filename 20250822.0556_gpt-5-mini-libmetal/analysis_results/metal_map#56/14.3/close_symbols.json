  "explanation": "For deciding whether any controlling expression in metal_map is invariant you need (1) the call sites that supply the function parameters and (2) the external macros/functions/constants used in the control expressions and their semantics:\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open: one of the callers of metal_map; necessary to inspect how fd, offset, size and expand are supplied at that call site (a parameter passed as a compile-time constant at all call sites could make a controlling expression effectively invariant).\n- metal_shmem_try_map: the other caller; same reason as above \u2014 need to see the actual arguments passed (especially expand and fd) to determine if conditions like if (expand) or if (fd < 0) are invariant.\n\nMacros/constants and I/O/syscall semantics (required to determine whether comparisons/conditions can be constant or depend on runtime results):\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: used to build 'prot' (not a control directly) but included to be complete about external constants used in the function.\n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: these modify 'flags' and one of them is assigned in the fd<0 branch; need to know they are compile-time constants but only relevant to evaluate whether any control expression depends solely on constants.\n- MAP_FAILED: used in the final test (mem == MAP_FAILED); knowing its definition (usually (void *) -1) clarifies that the test compares a runtime result (mmap return) with a constant, so not invariant.\n- LOCK_EX: argument to flock; required to understand flock() call semantics when determining whether error changes at runtime.\n- errno: used to compute error from flock; need to know errno is a runtime, call-site-modifiable global, so error is not a compile-time constant.\n- flock: its return semantics (0 on success, -1 on failure and sets errno) determine whether error becomes non\u2011zero at runtime \u2014 important for the subsequent if (!error) tests.\n- fstat: provides struct stat.st_size used in the comparison stat.st_size < reqsize; need to know fstat reads runtime file size, so that test is not a compile-time invariant.\n- ftruncate: may change file size and affects the runtime outcome of later checks; semantics required to see whether error can change.\n- mmap: returns runtime pointer (or MAP_FAILED); its semantics determine whether mem == MAP_FAILED is a runtime check.\n- struct stat (st_size): the st_size field is read from fstat and used in a controlling expression; its runtime value is needed to show that the controlling expression depends on file state rather than being invariant.\n\nIn short: to determine if any controlling expression in metal_map is an invariant constant you must (a) inspect all callers to see if parameters are always the same constant and (b) know the semantics/definitions of the external macros and system calls used in the control expressions to establish whether those expressions can vary at runtime."
