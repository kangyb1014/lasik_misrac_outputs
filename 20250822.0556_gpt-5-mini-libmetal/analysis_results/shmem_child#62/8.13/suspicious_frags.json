  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they do not present pointers that appear to be eligible for additional const-qualification, or they are API calls/uses that likely require non-const pointers. Examples excluded: variable-only declarations without pointer types (size, phys, error), calls that operate on values or error handling (metal_log, atomic_fetch_add), the shmem open/finish calls and other uses where the API likely mandates non-const parameters (metal_shmem_open, metal_io_finish), and simple non-pointer expressions. The listed fragments are the code locations where pointer types and pointer-to-object uses occur and thus should be investigated for possible const-qualification per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
