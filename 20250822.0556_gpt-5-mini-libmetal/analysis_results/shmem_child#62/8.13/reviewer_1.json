True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'virt' is declared as a non-const pointer but is only used for address translation/inspection (metal_io_virt and metal_io_virt_to_phys) and never used to modify the pointee. Therefore it could and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct { ... } *virt). Passing a non-const pointer here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (To fully comply, the called API should accept a const void * if it does not modify the memory.)\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fc8001560\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd83f2000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nobserved virt->counter=0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd83f2000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd83f2000\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd83f2000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fc8001560\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fc0001560\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd81f2000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nobserved virt->counter=0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd81f2000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd81f2000\nshmem_child start: name=/foo, requested_size=1048576\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd81f2000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fc0001560\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fb4001560\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd83f2000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nobserved virt->counter=0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd83f2000\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd83f2000\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fcc001560\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd83f2000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fb4001560\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd8cf3000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fd0001560\nobserved virt->counter=0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd8cf3000\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd82f2000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd8cf3000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd8cf3000) returned 0\nobserved virt->counter=0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fcc001560\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd82f2000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd82f2000\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd82f2000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fd0001560\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fbc001560\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fc4001560\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fd80f2000\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fbbf00000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nobserved virt->counter=0\nobserved virt->counter=0\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fc80015e0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fd80f2000\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fbbf00000\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fbb4ff000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fd80f2000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fbbf00000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fd80f2000) returned 0\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fbbf00000) returned 0\nobserved virt->counter=0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fbc001560\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fc4001560\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fbb4ff000\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fbb4ff000\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fbb4ff000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fc80015e0\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nshmem_child end for name=/foo\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fb0001560\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fbb5ff000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nmetal_shmem_open returned error=0, io=0x7f4fa8001560\nobserved virt->counter=0\nmetal_io_virt returned virt=0x7f4fbabfe000\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fbb5ff000\nmetal_io_phys returned phys=0\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fbb5ff000\nobserved virt->counter=0\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fbb5ff000) returned 0\naddress of virt->mutex=0x7f4fbabfe000\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fb0001560\nmetal_io_phys_to_virt(0) returned 0x7f4fbabfe000\nmetal_io_virt_to_phys(0x7f4fbabfe000) returned 0\ncalling metal_io_finish for io=0x7f4fa8001\n</execution_log>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's observation (that 'virt' is only read in this function and therefore could be const) is superficially reasonable, but the report is not correct as a definite MISRA 8.13 violation for the code shown. Rule 8.13 asks that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible; \u201cwhenever possible\u201d includes consideration of interoperability with the APIs the pointer is passed to. In this function 'virt' is obtained from metal_io_virt(...) and then passed to metal_io_virt_to_phys(...). If those APIs are declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. void *), making the local pointer a pointer-to-const would create a qualifier mismatch or require an explicit cast (which would itself be problematic). Without changing the called APIs, declaring virt as const is therefore not necessarily possible. The execution log shows only reads of the pointed data here, but that alone does not prove that a const declaration is feasible given the API signatures and intended uses. Thus there is insufficient evidence to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation in the provided code as-is."
