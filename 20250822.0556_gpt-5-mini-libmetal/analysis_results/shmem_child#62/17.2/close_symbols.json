  "explanation": "To determine whether shmem_child violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer must examine every function that shmem_child calls (directly) and the transitive callees of those functions (indirect calls) to ensure none eventually call back into shmem_child. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- metal_shmem_open: directly called by shmem_child; its implementation/callees must be inspected for any path back to shmem_child.\n- metal_shmem_open_generic: a callee of metal_shmem_open (per the static call graph); include to check its call behavior for recursion.\n- metal_open: a callee of metal_shmem_open; include to check for indirect calls to shmem_child.\n- metal_shmem_try_map: a callee of metal_shmem_open; include to check for indirect calls to shmem_child.\n- metal_io_virt: directly called by shmem_child; must be checked for any calls that could lead back to shmem_child.\n- metal_io_phys: directly called by shmem_child; include to rule out indirect recursion.\n- metal_io_phys_to_virt: directly called by shmem_child; include to rule out indirect recursion.\n- metal_io_virt_to_phys: directly called by shmem_child; include to rule out indirect recursion.\n- metal_io_finish: directly called by shmem_child; include to rule out indirect recursion.\n- atomic_fetch_add: directly called by shmem_child (used to increment nb_err on error); include because it is a direct callee and could theoretically call back into shmem_child.\n- metal_log: directly called by shmem_child for logging; include because it is a direct callee and must be checked for any calls that could lead back to shmem_child.\n\nNote: constants and globals used only for comparisons (e.g., METAL_BAD_OFFSET, nb_err) are not necessary to determine recursion unless they resolve to function-like macros that invoke functions; the items above cover all direct callees and the transitive callees shown in the provided static call graph."
