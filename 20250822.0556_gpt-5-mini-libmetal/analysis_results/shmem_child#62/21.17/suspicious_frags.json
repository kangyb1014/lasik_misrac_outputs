  "explanation": "No occurrences of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided shmem_child code or the additional line. The only string-like use is the assignment const char *name = arg and passing name to metal_shmem_open, but metal_shmem_open is not a Standard Library function; any use of string.h inside that implementation is outside the supplied code and cannot be judged here. Similarly, calls to metal_io_virt, metal_io_phys, metal_io_phys_to_virt, metal_io_virt_to_phys, metal_io_finish do not use the standard <string.h> API in this snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided source that require investigation for Rule 21.17. If you want a definitive assessment, inspect the implementations of the external functions (metal_shmem_open and the metal_io_* functions) for use of the banned string functions and ensure their pointer/length usage cannot access out-of-bounds memory."
