Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- metal_for_each_page_size_down (macro and its expansion: initializer/condition/increment expressions and any helper functions/macros it uses)\n  - The for loop in the target is written via this macro. To apply the MISRA rule we must inspect the three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) produced by the macro expansion. The macro may introduce its own loop-counter variable(s), conditions with side-effects, or modify objects in the third clause; its expansion determines whether the loop is well-formed (single loop counter, no persistent side-effects in the condition, only loop-counter modifications in the third clause, and that the counter is not modified in the body). Therefore the macro definition and the exact code it expands to (including any helper functions/macros called in the init/test/next expressions) are necessary.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (definition)\n  - The loop body and the loop condition use ps->page_size. To determine whether the loop control expression uses only the loop counter (or a control flag) and whether any body calls modify fields used by the loop condition, we need the struct layout and member semantics. Also to check if ps itself is the loop counter introduced by the macro and whether it can be legally the single loop counter per MISRA.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map\n  - This function is called inside the loop body. MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body; if this function modifies the loop counter or any object used in the loop condition/iteration (for example members of metal_page_size or global iterator state used by the macro), the loop could violate the rule. The function implementation/prototype is required to see what objects it modifies (parameters and global state).\n\n- metal_map, metal_unmap, metal_io_init, metal_virt2phys\n  - These functions are callees of metal_shmem_try_map (per the call graph). Because the behaviour of functions called within the loop body is part of the loop body, we must inspect these callees to see whether they modify any object that the loop control expressions depend on (e.g., the page-size list, the ps object, or any global iterator state used by metal_for_each_page_size_down). If any of these modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop condition/third-clause, MISRA compliance could be affected.\n\nNote: if the macro expansion references specific helper functions (e.g., functions that return the first/next/previous page_size node), include the definitions of those exact helper symbols as well \u2014 they are required for the same reason as the macro expansion itself (they form the initialization/test/increment clauses of the for loop)."
