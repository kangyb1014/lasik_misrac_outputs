  "explanation": "To check whether pointers in metal_shmem_open should be const-qualified, the analyzer must know how those pointers are used by called code and the types involved:\n\n- metal_shmem_open_generic: The function is called with (name, size, result). Its prototype/definition is required to see whether it accepts a const char * for name and whether it writes through result (i.e., modifies *result). That determines if the result parameter and name can/should be const-qualified in the caller.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: Called with (ps, fd, size, result). Its prototype/definition is required to determine whether it mutates ps or the region pointed to by result (writes *result or fields within), and whether it accepts ps as const. This determines if ps and result in metal_shmem_open could be const.\n\n- metal_open: Called with name. The signature is required to confirm whether metal_open expects a const char * or a plain char *; passing a const char * to a non-const parameter would be a const-correctness issue.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The definition is required to know whether the pointed-to region is intended to be modified by callers. If callers never modify its contents, pointers could be to const struct metal_io_region. The layout also shows whether functions likely modify fields.\n\n- struct metal_page_size: The type definition is needed to see whether iteration only reads page_size (so ps could be const) or whether other fields/functions the iterator uses require non-const access.\n\n- metal_for_each_page_size_down: The macro/iterator implementation determines how ps is declared/initialized by the iteration. If the iterator yields non-const pointers, that may prevent marking ps const in this function unless the macro supports const variants.\n\n- metal_io_region_size: Called (indirectly) by metal_shmem_open_generic according to the call graph; its prototype/definition helps understand whether region-size-related operations require mutable access to struct metal_io_region, which affects whether result (or objects it points to) can be const.\n\nProviding these symbols (prototypes/definitions/macros) lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer parameters or local pointer variables in metal_shmem_open could be made const without violating callees' requirements, thereby evaluating compliance with the MISRA rule."
