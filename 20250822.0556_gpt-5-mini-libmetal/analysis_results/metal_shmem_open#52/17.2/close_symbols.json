  "explanation": "To determine if metal_shmem_open violates the MISRA rule against (direct or indirect) self-calls we must inspect every function it calls and the functions those call, to see whether any path leads back to metal_shmem_open. For each symbol: \n- metal_shmem_open_generic: called directly by metal_shmem_open; its body may call other functions that could (indirectly) call metal_shmem_open. \n- metal_io_region_size: called by metal_shmem_open_generic; include to check transitive calls that might lead back to metal_shmem_open. \n- metal_open: called directly by metal_shmem_open; include to verify it does not call (directly or indirectly) metal_shmem_open. \n- metal_shmem_try_map: called directly by metal_shmem_open; its implementation could call back to metal_shmem_open, so it and its callees must be checked. \n- metal_map: callee of metal_shmem_try_map; included to check further transitive call paths. \n- metal_unmap: callee of metal_shmem_try_map; included to check further transitive call paths. \n- metal_io_init: callee of metal_shmem_try_map; included to check further transitive call paths. \n- metal_virt2phys: callee of metal_shmem_try_map; included to check further transitive call paths. \nNote: callers of metal_shmem_open (e.g., shmem_child) need not be included to detect recursion originating from metal_shmem_open, because recursion is concerned with calls originating from metal_shmem_open that return to it; only the transitive closure of its callees is necessary."
