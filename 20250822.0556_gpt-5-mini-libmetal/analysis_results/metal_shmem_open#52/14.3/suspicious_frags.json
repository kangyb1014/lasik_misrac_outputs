  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions in the function do not need further investigation for Rule 14.3 because they are not invariant: \n- \"error = metal_shmem_open_generic(name, size, result); if (!error) return error;\" \u2014 the condition uses 'error' assigned by a function call, so it is not a compile-time invariant.\n- \"error = metal_open(name, 1); if (error < 0) { ... return error; }\" \u2014 'error' is set by a runtime call, so the condition is not invariant.\n- The inner tests (ps->page_size > 2 * size) and (if (!error) break) depend on 'ps', 'size', and 'error' which are runtime values (ps is the loop variable and error is set each iteration), so they are not invariant unless the loop construct itself causes invariance. \nThe only fragment that requires investigation against MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 is the loop macro 'metal_for_each_page_size_down(ps)' because its expansion may produce an invariant controlling expression (or an intentional infinite loop). The macro expansion must be inspected to determine whether the controlling expression is invariant or otherwise conforms to the rule (including allowed exceptions for deliberate infinite loops or the specific do-while exception)."
