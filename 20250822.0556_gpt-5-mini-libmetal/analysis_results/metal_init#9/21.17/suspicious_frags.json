  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions; in the provided function the only call to a string.h function is the memset line, so that call must be investigated to ensure it does not write beyond the bounds of the _metal object. No other calls to functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the target code. Other statements (ref_count increments, assignments from params, list initialization calls, metal_sys_init) do not invoke string.h functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17, so they need not be flagged here. Note also that _metal is declared as 'extern struct metal_state _metal' \u2014 investigation should verify that sizeof(_metal) matches the actual object size and that &_metal is a valid pointer, but that is part of reviewing the memset fragment rather than a separate suspicious fragment."
