  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function contains only standard C constructs: normal function definition, pointer dereference (params->...), pre/post increment operators, sizeof, memset, and calls to other functions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions or vendor-specific keywords such as __attribute__, __asm, asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous structs/unions as extensions, named address-space qualifiers, or nonstandard pragmas. The extern declaration of _metal is a standard linkage declaration, and use of identifiers beginning with an underscore is a naming convention and not a compiler extension. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
