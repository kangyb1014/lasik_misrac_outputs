  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. In the provided function the only control statements are the two if statements listed above. There are no for/while/do-while loop controlling expressions or other conditional expressions in this function to consider. Other lines (variable declarations/initialization, memset, assignments, function calls, and the final increment) are not controlling expressions and thus are not subject to Rule 14.3; they do not need investigation for this specific rule."
