Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_init:\n```c\nint metal_init(const struct metal_init_params *params)\n{\n\tint error = 0;\n\n\tif (_metal.common.ref_count++ != 0)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\n\tmemset(&_metal, 0, sizeof(_metal));\n\n\t_metal.common.log_handler   = params->log_handler;\n\t_metal.common.log_level     = params->log_level;\n\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.bus_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_device_list);\n\n\terror = metal_sys_init(params);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\t++_metal.common.ref_count;\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n++_metal.common.ref_count;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final increment (++_metal.common.ref_count;) is required to set the reference count to 1 after the memset cleared it. For the initial case (ref_count == 0) the earlier post-increment before memset is undone by memset and acts only as a reentrancy guard while initialization runs. If the final increment were removed, a successful initialization would leave ref_count == 0, causing subsequent calls to metal_init to behave differently (they would attempt to reinitialize rather than detect an existing initialization). Therefore this fragment is not dead code."
