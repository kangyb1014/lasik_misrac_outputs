  "explanation": "Other fragments were not selected because they do not present situations where a pointer could reasonably be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - Local scalar variables (int error, i) and the function return statement do not involve pointer target qualification. - The assignment '*threads_out = i;' and the use of '&tid_p[i]' write to caller-provided storage, so those pointers are intentionally mutable (making them const would be incorrect). - The logging and error-handling calls (metal_log, strerror) do not introduce new pointer target qualifications within this function and use library-provided interfaces whose pointer qualifications are fixed. - The loop control and numeric logic do not contain pointer targets that could be qualified as const. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
