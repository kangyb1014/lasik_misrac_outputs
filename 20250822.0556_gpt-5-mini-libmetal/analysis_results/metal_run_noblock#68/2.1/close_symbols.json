  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- metal_log\n  - The function is called twice in metal_run_noblock on error paths. If metal_log does not return (e.g. it terminates the process, longjmps, or otherwise transfers control), code after the call (the explicit return -EINVAL; or the subsequent loop/return) could be unreachable. You must inspect metal_log implementation/attributes to decide reachability.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR\n  - The macro/value passed to metal_log could change metal_log behaviour (e.g. trigger fatal logging path). Knowing its definition is needed when analysing whether the metal_log calls can abort/exit and thus make later statements unreachable.\n\n- pthread_create\n  - The loop body and the loop exit depend on pthread_create returning. If pthread_create is implemented in a non-standard way (e.g. a wrapper that never returns or that longjmps/exits on failure), that affects whether subsequent statements (the break, the remaining iterations, the final *threads_out assignment and return) are reachable. You need its contract/implementation to judge reachability.\n\n- strerror\n  - strerror is called with error as argument in the logging path. If strerror has non-standard behaviour (e.g. terminates on invalid input) this could make subsequent code unreachable; also passing a negative value (because error is assigned -pthread_create(...)) could have implementation-defined effects \u2014 relevant to determining whether that logging/error branch actually returns to the function.\n\n- pthread_t\n  - The type is used for tid_p and influences how pthread_create is invoked; while not directly about control flow, knowing whether pthread_t is an alias to a type with special semantics (unlikely but possible in platform-specific code) is required for a conservative reachability analysis.\n\n- metal_thread_t\n  - The child function pointer type passed to pthread_create may be a wrapper that does not return or triggers different thread-creation side effects. The type and its calling/ABI semantics help determine whether the call site can be assumed to return normally.\n\n- EINVAL\n  - The macro/value returned on the tids==NULL path is a visible control-flow outcome; knowing its definition is needed to check whether that branch is a normal return or if EINVAL is tied to other behaviour in project-specific code (rare but useful to confirm).\n\n- metal_run (caller)\n  - metal_run is a direct caller of metal_run_noblock. To assess whether any code inside metal_run_noblock is actually unreachable in the whole project you must inspect how metal_run calls it (what arguments it passes, whether it guards certain branches, and whether it relies on metal_run_noblock never returning in some cases). Call-site invariants can make intra-function statements unreachable.\n\n- condition (caller)\n  - condition is another direct caller. As with metal_run, you must inspect how condition invokes metal_run_noblock (argument values, preconditions) because caller-side guarantees can make code paths inside metal_run_noblock unreachable.\n\nNote: The primary concerns for unreachable-code here are any logging or threading helper functions/macros (metal_log, METAL_LOG_ERROR, pthread_create, strerror) that might not return normally, and the callers (metal_run, condition) whose calling patterns/argument invariants could statically make some branches of metal_run_noblock impossible. Examining these symbols lets the next analyst determine whether any statements in metal_run_noblock can never be executed."
