  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are variable declarations, simple assignments, control flow (for loop, if, break), pointer cast and return statements which do not perform function calls and therefore cannot directly or indirectly cause recursion. The only expressions that invoke functions (and thus could lead to indirect recursion) are the pthread_create call (which spawns the supplied 'child' function) and the two metal_log/strerror calls; these have been reported above. No other code fragments in this function contain function-call sites that would require investigation under MISRA C Rule 17.2."
