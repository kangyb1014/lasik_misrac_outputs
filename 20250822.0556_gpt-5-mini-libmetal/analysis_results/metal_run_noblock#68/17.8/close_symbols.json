  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n- pthread_create: The prototype (int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg)) is required to determine that pthread_create receives a pointer to pthread_t and may modify the pthread_t objects it is given, but it receives its arguments by value and cannot directly modify the parameter variables of metal_run_noblock (e.g. tids, child, threads_out). This distinction is central to the MISRA rule (pointer parameters may have their pointees modified, but parameter variables must not be assigned).\n\n- pthread_t: The type of the thread identifier is needed to check the cast (pthread_t *)tids and to reason about whether assigning through tid_p modifies the pointer parameter tids itself (it does not) versus modifying the objects pointed to by tids (which is allowed).\n\n- metal_thread_t: The definition/type of the child parameter (presumably a function-pointer type) is needed to verify that child is passed to pthread_create by value and is not being assigned to inside the function (assigning to a parameter variable would violate the MISRA rule).\n\n- strerror: Its prototype (char *strerror(int errnum)) is needed to confirm it only reads an integer error code for logging and does not modify any of metal_run_noblock's parameters.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_ERROR: The logging function/macros must be known to ensure they do not have hidden side effects that assign to the function parameters. Confirming metal_log only reads its arguments (and does not modify tids, child, threads, or threads_out) is necessary to conclude MISRA compliance.\n\n- EINVAL: The definition/constant value is needed only to understand the early return path (error return on NULL tids); it is not involved in modifying parameters but is part of control flow that must be understood for the analysis.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any called functions or used macros could be performing assignments to the function parameter variables (which would violate the MISRA rule) versus only modifying pointees (which is allowed)."
