  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned or otherwise modified in this function, so there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Details:\n- threads: only read as loop bound, not modified.\n- child: passed to pthread_create but not assigned to or modified; passing a pointer parameter as an argument does not modify the parameter itself.\n- arg: passed to pthread_create (the callee may use/modify the object), but this function does not modify the arg pointer variable.\n- tids: the code casts tids into a local pointer variable (pthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids). Creating and using a local pointer alias does not modify the function parameter variable tids. The object pointed to by tids is potentially modified by pthread_create via &tid_p[i], which is allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified).\n- threads_out: the function stores into *threads_out (writes the object pointed to), which is allowed; the pointer parameter threads_out itself is not reassigned.\n\nNote: There are other potential issues (for example, no NULL check for threads_out before dereferencing), but these are not violations of Rule 17.8 and therefore are not flagged here."
