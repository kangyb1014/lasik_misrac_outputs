First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of metal_io_block_read.\n```c\nint metal_io_block_read(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       void *restrict dst, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tunsigned char *dest = dst;\n\tint retlen;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_read) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_read)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, dst, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t\twhile ( len && (\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)dest % sizeof(int)) ||\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)))) {\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)dest =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)ptr;\n\t\t\tdest++;\n\t\t\tptr++;\n\t\t\tlen--;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); dest += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)dest = *(const unsigned int *)ptr;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; dest++, ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)dest =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)ptr;\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for statement's third clause modifies dest and ptr in addition to len: \"dest += sizeof(int), ptr += sizeof(int), len -= sizeof(int)\". MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter (and there shall be only one loop counter). Updating pointer objects in the iteration-expression means there is more than one loop control object and the third clause is not restricted to only the loop counter \u2014 this violates clauses 3 and 4 of Rule 14.2. (The first clause is empty and the second clause uses only the loop counter len, which would be acceptable.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_io_block_read:\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The for loop iteration-expression modifies more than the single loop counter: dest and ptr are incremented in the third clause in addition to len (the intended loop counter). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter (and there shall be only one loop counter). The same pattern appears in the subsequent for (; len != 0; dest++, ptr++, len--) as well. Both loops therefore violate clauses 3 and 4 of Rule 14.2."
