  "explanation": "I did not flag other code fragments because they use standard C language features (function pointers, casts, arithmetic, pointer dereference, sizeof, control structures, errno macro ERANGE, standard integer/unsigned types, struct access). There are no compiler-specific extensions present such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_... intrinsics, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific language extensions elsewhere in the function. The listed fragments are the only parts that may require review for use of non\u2011base-language features: 'restrict' (C99 keyword that some compilers treat specially), use of stdatomic identifiers (atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_seq_cst \u2014 C11 atomics), and uintptr_t (C99 integer type). These should be checked against the target compiler documentation to confirm they are not implemented as compiler extensions in that environment; all other lines are plain standard C and do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
