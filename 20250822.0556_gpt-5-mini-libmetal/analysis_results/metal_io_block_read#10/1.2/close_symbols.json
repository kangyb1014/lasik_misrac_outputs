  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must know which identifiers/types/macros are standard C or compiler-specific extensions and whether the code\u2019s usage matches their standard signatures. Concretely:\n\n- struct metal_io_region (full definition): needed to see the exact types of its members (size, ops) and to determine whether any nonstandard compiler extensions are used in the struct declaration or member types.\n- io->size (member): needed to confirm its type (bounds arithmetic uses it) and whether that type or any operations on it rely on extensions.\n- io->ops (member): required to inspect the ops object type (likely a struct of function pointers) to check whether its declaration uses extensions.\n- type/definition of io->ops.block_read (function-pointer prototype): essential to verify the expected parameter types (for example whether the fourth parameter is of type memory_order or a compiler-specific type) and to ensure the call site (passing memory_order_seq_cst) is using a standard type and calling convention rather than an extension.\n- metal_io_virt (declaration/prototype): required to check its return type and whether the implicit/explicit casts in the function are standard-conforming (no use of nonstandard pointer casts or extensions in its declaration).\n- atomic_thread_fence (declaration): needed to confirm this is the standard C11 atomic function (from <stdatomic.h>) and not a compiler-specific extension or macro.\n- memory_order_seq_cst and memory_order (type): to determine whether these are the standard C11 atomic constants/types or compiler-specific extensions; the code passes memory_order_seq_cst to block_read and calls atomic_thread_fence with it, so their provenance matters for the MISRA rule.\n- uintptr_t (typedef): required to check that uintptr_t is the standard typedef (from <stdint.h>) and not a nonstandard extension; it is used for alignment checks via cast.\n- ERANGE (macro): to confirm it is the standard errno macro (from <errno.h>) rather than a project-specific or compiler extension.\n\nProviding these symbols (or their header origins) lets the analyser determine whether the code relies on standard C constructs (C99/C11) or on compiler-specific language extensions."
