  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are controlled by conditional logic or branching and therefore could be unreachable depending on runtime assumptions (e.g. guarantees about metal_io_virt(), about io->ops.block_read being present, or about the numeric behavior of offset+len). Other parts of the function are simple, unconditionally executed statements or straightforward variable declarations/assignments and the final return, and do not contain conditional branches that could make code unreachable, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: - the initial declarations and the call/assignment ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset) are simple setup steps (reachability depends on the subsequent ptr check which is already reported). - the assignment retlen = len and the final return retlen; are ordinary operations reached along all non-returning paths. - pointer increments and casts inside the reported loops have been included where conditional; any other single-line pointer arithmetic outside a conditional is straightforward and reachable. These unlisted fragments do not present distinct unreachable-code concerns beyond the conditional constructs already reported."
