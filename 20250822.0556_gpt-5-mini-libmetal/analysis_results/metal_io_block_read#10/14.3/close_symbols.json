  "explanation": "For applying MISRA C rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d to the loops in metal_io_block_read you need symbols that determine whether the loop controlling expressions can change at runtime or are compile/time/ABI invariants:\n\n- struct metal_io_region (full definition): the code reads io->size and io->ops; the type and semantics of these fields (particularly ops) determine whether the branch that selects the loops is taken and how io->size influences len. Knowing size field type also helps reason about overflow/adjustment of len.\n\n- struct metal_io_ops (full definition, including block_read member type): the test if (io->ops.block_read) controls whether the function takes the fast-path (function call) or the manual copy loops. You must know the type/placement of block_read to determine whether that member can be statically constant (invariant) or may vary at runtime (affects whether the loop is even reachable).\n\n- metal_io_virt prototype/implementation (return type and any alignment/null guarantees): metal_io_virt supplies ptr used in the alignment/modulo expressions. To decide whether ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) is invariant you must know what pointer alignment metal_io_virt returns (e.g. always int-aligned, never aligned, may be NULL). Also need to know whether it can return NULL (affects early return) and whether it can return pointers whose alignment never changes under increments (unlikely but must be known).\n\n- sizeof(int) on the target platform (compile-time value): the modulo expressions use sizeof(int). If sizeof(int) == 1, the modulo results are always 0 which can make the controlling expressions constant (invariant). The concrete sizeof(int) is required to determine that.\n\n- typedef uintptr_t and platform pointer->integer conversion / pointer alignment guarantees (ABI): the controlling expressions cast pointers to uintptr_t and take modulo. The semantics of pointer-to-integer conversion and guaranteed alignment/pointer representation on the target platform affect whether the modulo results change as ptr/dest are incremented. You need ABI rules (alignment of returned pointers and of caller-supplied dst) to decide if the expression can be invariant.\n\n- API/caller contract or annotations for dst alignment (if any): dst is a caller-supplied void *restrict. If the API guarantees particular alignment for dst (or there are annotations/attributes), that can make ((uintptr_t)dest % sizeof(int)) invariant. The analysis must know whether any such guarantee exists.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as memory_order_seq_cst, atomic_thread_fence, ERANGE do not affect whether the loop controlling expressions are invariant and are not required for this specific MISRA rule check.)"
