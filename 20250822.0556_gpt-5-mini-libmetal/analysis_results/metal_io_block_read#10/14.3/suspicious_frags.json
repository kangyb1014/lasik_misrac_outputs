  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found. Each loop's controlling expression depends on a variable that is modified within the loop body or the loop iteration expression:\n\n- while ( len && (((uintptr_t)dest % sizeof(int)) || ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)))): The loop decrements len and increments dest and ptr inside the loop, so the condition is not invariant.\n- for (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); dest += sizeof(int), ptr += sizeof(int), len -= sizeof(int)): The loop decreases len in the iteration expression, so the condition changes each iteration.\n- for (; len != 0; dest++, ptr++, len--): The loop decrements len in the iteration expression, so the condition is not invariant.\n\nOther conditional expressions (if (!ptr), if ((offset + len) > io->size), if (io->ops.block_read)) are not iteration controlling expressions targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and/or depend on runtime values rather than being compile-time invariants. There are no explicit infinite loops (for(;;) or while(1)) or do-while constant-false constructs that would fall under the rule's exceptions. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
