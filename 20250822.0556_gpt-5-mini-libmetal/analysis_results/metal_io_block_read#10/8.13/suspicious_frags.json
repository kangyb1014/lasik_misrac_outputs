  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either refer to the destination buffer (which is written to and therefore must be a non-const pointer), perform non-qualifier-related operations (arithmetic on lengths, return value handling, atomic_thread_fence), or invoke a callback whose parameter types may legitimately require a non-const pointer (so the local function cannot unilaterally make that parameter const). Pointer arithmetic and alignment checks themselves do not force a change of pointee-constness. The listed fragments are the locations where a pointer to read-only memory is used without being declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (or where casts add constness only at use), and thus should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
