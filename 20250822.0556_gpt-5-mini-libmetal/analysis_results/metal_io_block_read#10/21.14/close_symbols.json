  "explanation": "- metal_io_virt: the target directly calls this; you must inspect its definition to see what kind of pointer it returns (raw memory vs. pointer to character data / NUL-terminated strings) and whether it itself calls memcmp or otherwise delegates to string-comparison code.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: required to understand the semantics of io, the meaning of io->size, and especially the ops field layout so you can find where block_read is declared and how it is used.\n\n- type/definition of io->ops (metal_io_ops or equivalent): needed to know the prototype and intended semantics of block_read (arguments, return conventions, whether it may perform higher-level string operations). This tells you whether the function pointer call could invoke code that uses memcmp on strings.\n\n- all functions/objects that initialize or assign io->ops/block_read (region init functions and ops tables): block_read is invoked indirectly via a function pointer. To determine if any memcmp-on-string violation can occur you must find every place that populates io->ops (static ops tables, platform init, region constructors) so you can locate concrete implementations.\n\n- any function(s) that can be assigned to io->ops.block_read (the block_read implementations): those implementations are the real callees at runtime; you must inspect their source to see whether they call memcmp and whether they pass pointers/lengths that could cause memcmp to be used on null-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp and all call sites of memcmp reachable from this module: the MISRA rule is about use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. Locate memcmp itself and any call sites that are reachable from metal_io_block_read (directly or via the block_read implementations) and inspect argument usage to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst trace the indirect call (io->ops.block_read), determine concrete implementations reachable from this function, and find any memcmp usages in those paths to decide if the MISRA rule is violated."
