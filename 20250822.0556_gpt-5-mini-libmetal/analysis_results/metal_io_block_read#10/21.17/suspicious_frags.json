  "explanation": "No use of <string.h> functions is present in the provided code snippet. The function performs either: (a) a call to the external function pointer io->ops.block_read (an external implementation which is not a direct use of <string.h> here), or (b) manual copying via single-byte and word-sized assignments. The code contains explicit checks that mitigate out-of-bounds reads from the I/O region: ptr is checked for NULL and len is clamped with if ((offset + len) > io->size) len = io->size - offset; so the local copy loops operate on the adjusted len and do not invoke any standard string functions. Therefore there are no direct uses of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc., to be reported for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this function.\n\nNotes for reviewers (not flagged as suspicious fragments for Rule 21.17 but relevant context):\n- The call to io->ops.block_read is an external function; its implementation should be reviewed separately for any use of <string.h> functions that could violate Rule 21.17. The call site itself does not invoke those functions.\n- The manual word-sized copies use pointer casts (unsigned int *) which may raise alignment or aliasing concerns and warrant review under other MISRA rules, but these are not violations of Rule 21.17 (which is specific to string.h functions)."
