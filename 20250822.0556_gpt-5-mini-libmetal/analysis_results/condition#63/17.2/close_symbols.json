  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking indirect or direct recursion (MISRA):\n\n- metal_run\n  - condition directly calls metal_run. You must inspect metal_run's implementation and declaration (prototype) to determine whether metal_run calls condition (direct recursion) or calls other functions that eventually call condition (indirect recursion). Also check whether metal_run invokes its thread callback(s) synchronously (i.e., by direct call) or spawns new threads \u2014 synchronous invocation could create a direct/indirect call chain back to condition.\n\n- metal_run_noblock\n  - condition directly calls metal_run_noblock. metal_run_noblock could call condition back (forming a cycle) or call other functions that do. Also, because metal_run calls metal_run_noblock (per the static graph), inspect both to identify any possible cycle via their mutual calls.\n\n- metal_finish_threads\n  - condition calls metal_finish_threads. Although the static graph shows it has no callees, verify its implementation to ensure it does not call condition (directly or indirectly) or call other routines that could lead back to condition.\n\n- producer_thread\n  - producer_thread is passed as the thread callback to metal_run/metal_run_noblock. If either metal_run or metal_run_noblock invoke the callback synchronously (i.e., call the function pointer in the same call chain), producer_thread could be part of an indirect recursion path back to condition. Inspect producer_thread to ensure it does not call condition (directly or via other calls).\n\n- consumer_thread\n  - same rationale as producer_thread: it is passed as a callback and could participate in an indirect call chain back to condition if invoked synchronously or if it calls functions that lead back to condition.\n\n- metal_log\n  - condition calls metal_log on error paths. Although logging routines are unlikely to call back into application code, you must confirm metal_log does not (directly or indirectly) call condition or other functions that could lead to condition, avoiding a subtle recursion cycle.\n\nNotes on scope of checks:\n- For MISRA rule 8.8 (no direct or indirect recursion), you must inspect each callee's implementation and any functions they call transitively to determine whether any path leads back to condition. In particular, confirm whether callbacks passed to metal_run/metal_run_noblock are invoked synchronously (part of the same call chain) or only executed in separate threads (which would not form a call-chain recursion). The symbols listed above are the minimal additional symbols required to perform that analysis."
