  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: passing the null pointer constant (NULL) to metal_run does not by itself violate Rule 8.13. The rule concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. From this single call we cannot see the function or parameter declarations. A concrete violation scenario would be if metal_run were declared to take a pointer to mutable data (e.g. void *arg or a thread function prototype using void *), but the implementation never modifies the pointed-to object \u2014 in that case the parameter and related pointer types should be declared const (for example const void *arg or a thread function taking const void *), and the current non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13."
