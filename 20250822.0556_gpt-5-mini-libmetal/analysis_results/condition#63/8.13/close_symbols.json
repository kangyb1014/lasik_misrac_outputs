  "explanation": "To decide if the code violates \"a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" we must know whether the called functions modify the memory pointed-to (in which case non-const is appropriate) or do not modify it (in which case parameters should be const). Concretely:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (declaration and definition): needed to see the exact prototype (types and const qualifiers of pointer parameters such as the tids and ts_created parameters) and to inspect the implementation to determine whether the function writes into the buffers passed (so whether pointers must be non-const).\n\n- metal_run (declaration and definition): similarly required to know the parameter types/const-qualification and whether it (or functions it calls) modifies the data pointed to by arguments.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (declaration and definition): the call uses an explicit cast (void *)tids. The prototype/implementation is required to know whether the function only reads the thread id array (so should accept a pointer-to-const) or modifies it (so non-const is correct). The implementation shows whether the cast removes necessary const or introduces a potential MISRA issue.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread (declarations/signatures): their function-pointer types are passed into metal_run/_noblock. Their signatures (parameters and return types) and whether they modify any data passed via their arguments can affect whether pointer parameters in the run functions should be const.\n\n- pthread_t typedef (from <pthread.h> or equivalent): needed to determine the exact type of tids and whether passing it through void * or other pointer types alters constness rules; also to ensure correct const qualification of pointers to thread IDs.\n\nExamining these symbols (prototypes and implementations) lets an analyst determine whether any pointer parameters could/should be const-qualified and whether any casts in the target function remove const or hide a violation of the MISRA rule."
