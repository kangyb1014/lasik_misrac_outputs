  "explanation": "To determine whether condition (or anything it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer needs the implementations (or signatures) of the following symbols:\n\n- metal_run_noblock: called directly by condition. It may itself call memcmp or call other functions that do, so its body must be inspected.\n- metal_run: called directly by condition and in the static graph calls metal_run_noblock/metal_finish_threads. It may contain memcmp usage or pass string data to callees that do; its implementation is required.\n- metal_finish_threads: called by condition (and by metal_run). It may perform operations on thread return data or strings; check for memcmp use.\n- producer_thread: passed as a thread entry to metal_run/_noblock. Thread functions often process buffers/strings; they must be examined for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings.\n- consumer_thread: same reason as producer_thread \u2014 passed into run functions and may perform string comparisons.\n- metal_log: used in condition for error messages. Although unlikely, its implementation could use memcmp (or wrap string comparisons). Include it to be safe.\n- memcmp: include the symbol so the analyzer can identify direct uses (calls to memcmp) in the above implementations and verify whether memcmp is applied to null-terminated strings.\n\nProvide these symbol implementations to the next agent so it can trace any memcmp usage from condition through its callees and determine if memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings."
