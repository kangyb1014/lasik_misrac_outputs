  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C prohibition on compiler language extensions we must inspect not only the target function body but also the declarations/definitions and macros it uses because compiler-specific extensions often appear there. Reasons: \n- metal_run_noblock (declaration/definition): the prototype or implementation may use compiler-specific attributes, inline asm, statement expressions, nested-function constructs or other extensions. The call in condition relies on its signature (function-pointer types, varargs, attributes) so we must inspect it. \n- metal_run (declaration/definition): same rationale as above; its declaration or implementation could use extensions (and per the call graph metal_run calls metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads). \n- metal_finish_threads (declaration/definition): ensure its prototype does not use nonstandard extensions (attributes, special calling conventions) and that the (void *)tids cast matches its expected parameter type without hiding an extension. \n- THREADS (macro / compile-time value): the array tids[THREADS] depends on THREADS. If THREADS is defined using a compiler extension (e.g. __COUNTER__, typeof, non-constant GCC expression) or results in a variable-length array usage, that could be a language-extension issue. \n- consumer_thread / producer_thread (prototype/definition): these are passed as function pointers; their declarations may include attributes or use extension constructs (nested functions are a common GCC extension). Need to verify they are standard function definitions. \n- metal_log (declaration/definition) and METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro): logging macros/functions may hide compiler-specific extensions such as statement expressions, typeof, GNU variadic macro extensions, or attributes. Inspecting these ensures the logging calls in condition are free of extensions. \n- Headers that declare the above symbols: the header files (e.g., the metal API header and any project headers that define THREADS, macros, typedefs) must be checked because compiler-specific extensions are frequently introduced in headers via macros or attributes. \nThese symbols together let the next agent inspect all places where compiler-specific language extensions could be introduced that affect the target function."
