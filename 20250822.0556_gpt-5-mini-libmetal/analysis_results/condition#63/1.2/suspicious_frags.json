  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. I inspected for common compiler extensions that are explicitly documented as such (for example: identifiers or keywords beginning with __, GCC/Clang attributes (__attribute__), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, inline assembly (asm), label-as-values, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other non-standard syntax). None are used.\n\nSpecific notes explaining why other constructs do NOT require investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2:\n- Declarations (int ret; int ts_created; pthread_t tids[THREADS];) use standard C syntax. If THREADS is not a compile-time constant and thus yields a VLA, VLAs are a standard C feature (C99); they are not a compiler extension per se. (If your toolchain treats VLAs as an extension, that would be a toolchain-specific policy but is not visible in this fragment.)\n- pthread_t and pthread-related functions are POSIX threading API usages, not language/compiler extensions.\n- Calls to metal_run_noblock, metal_run, metal_finish_threads, and metal_log are calls to library functions; library usage is not a language extension.\n- The cast (void *)tids is standard C pointer casting/decay behavior; it is not a compiler extension.\n- Use of goto/out label, comments (/* ... */ and /** ... */), return, and control-flow constructs are all standard C.\n\nBecause no explicit compiler extension tokens or constructs appear in the snippet, there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
