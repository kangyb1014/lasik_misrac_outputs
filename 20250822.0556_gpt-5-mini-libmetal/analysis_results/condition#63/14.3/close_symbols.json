  "explanation": "- metal_run_noblock: The target function assigns ret = metal_run_noblock(...) and then tests if (ret < 0). To decide if that controlling expression can be invariant you must inspect metal_run_noblock's implementation/signature and documented semantics (does it always return a fixed value, can it return negative error codes, under what conditions).\\n- metal_run: Similarly, ret = metal_run(...) is tested for (ret < 0). metal_run's implementation/semantics (it calls metal_run_noblock per the static call graph) determine the possible return values and whether the conditional can be invariant.\\n- metal_run return\u2011code definitions: Any macros/constants or documentation that define what return values mean (e.g. METAL_SUCCESS, negative error codes) are needed to interpret the tests ret < 0 and decide if they can ever be true/false.\\n- metal_run_noblock return\u2011code definitions: As above, the concrete error/success code definitions for metal_run_noblock are required to know the range of ret.\\n- THREADS macro/constant definition: THREADS controls how many threads are created and may influence metal_run/metal_run_noblock behavior (e.g. early exits when THREADS==0). If THREADS is a compile\u2011time constant (including zero) that forces a particular code path, the conditionals that depend on the functions' return values might become invariant.\\n- metal_finish_threads: Although not directly used in a conditional in condition(), its semantics (blocking, modifying shared state, error handling) can affect thread-run behavior and indirectly the return behavior of metal_run/metal_run_noblock (and thus whether the ret checks are effectively invariant). Include its signature/semantics.\\n- producer_thread and consumer_thread (entry functions): Their definitions may affect how metal_run/metal_run_noblock behave (for example, if these functions always fail immediately or change global state that makes metal_run always succeed/fail). Inspecting these thread entry functions helps determine if the calls they are passed produce invariant return values from the launcher functions.\\n\nOnly the listed symbols are needed to determine whether the controlling expressions (the if (ret < 0) tests) can ever vary at run time; other local variables (ret, ts_created, tids) are simple locals and do not require further symbol inspection for this MISRA C check."
