  "explanation": "The function condition(void) has no parameters, so there are no parameters in this function that could be modified (MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 concerns modifying a function's own parameters). The only variables modified here (ret, ts_created, tids) are local to this function, which is allowed. The listed fragments are the calls that pass pointers or function pointers (tids, &ts_created, producer_thread/consumer_thread, NULL) to other functions; those callee implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not modify their pointer parameters (i.e., assign to a pointer parameter variable), which would violate Rule 17.8 in those functions. Other parts of the code (local assignments, logging, comments, control flow, and casts such as (void *)tids) do not modify any function parameters in this scope and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.8 here."
