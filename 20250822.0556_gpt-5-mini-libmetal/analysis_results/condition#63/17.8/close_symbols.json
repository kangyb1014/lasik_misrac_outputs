  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified, we must know the exact parameter types and whether any pointers passed from condition could be (improperly) modified. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (prototype): needed to know its parameter types (especially whether it takes pointers such as pthread_t *tids or int *ts_created) so we can determine if condition is passing a pointer parameter that could be modified by value inside condition (e.g. via an unintended assignment) or if any cast in the call changes pointer semantics.\n\n- metal_run (prototype): needed to know its parameter types (thread function pointer and arg) to verify that arguments passed from condition are of correct types and to check whether any parameter passed by value might be modified in condition (e.g. via coercions or improper use).\n\n- metal_finish_threads (prototype): required to know whether it expects a pointer type (e.g. pthread_t *) or void * and whether the call metal_finish_threads(THREADS, (void *)tids) involves a cast that could hide modification of a pointer parameter. The prototype shows whether the second parameter is a pointer parameter (subject to the MISRA pointer rules) or not.\n\n- pthread_t (typedef / declaration): the type of tids[] elements must be known to verify that the array-to-pointer conversion and the (void *) cast are type-correct and to reason about whether condition modifies a pointer parameter or only the pointee objects.\n\n- consumer_thread (thread routine prototype): the thread-start routine type (signature) confirms whether consumer_thread matches the expected function-pointer parameter types of metal_run/metal_run_noblock; this helps determine whether condition is passing function pointers in a way that could modify parameters (and whether casts might be hiding pointer modifications).\n\n- producer_thread (thread routine prototype): same reason as consumer_thread \u2014 to check compatibility with callee prototypes and detect any suspicious casts or pointer manipulations in the calls.\n\n- THREADS (macro / constant definition): its type/value (usually an integer) clarifies that the first parameter is a count (not a pointer) so it cannot be a function parameter that condition modifies; this helps rule out false positives where a macro is mis-declared as a pointer type.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations/prototypes and type definitions) lets the next agent determine whether any parameters in condition itself are being modified (it has none) and whether the arguments it passes involve pointer manipulations or casts that could constitute modification of a function parameter according to MISRA C."
