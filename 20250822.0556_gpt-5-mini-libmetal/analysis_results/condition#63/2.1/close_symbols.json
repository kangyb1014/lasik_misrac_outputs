  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in condition() are unreachable you must know whether the called functions or macros can fail to return, abort the process, longjmp, or otherwise prevent control flow from reaching later statements. For each symbol:\n\n- metal_run_noblock: Need its prototype/implementation and documented behavior (return values, whether it can call exit/longjmp/noreturn, whether it blocks or can loop indefinitely). The function is called multiple times and its non-returning/aborting behavior would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- metal_run: Same reasons as metal_run_noblock. metal_run is called in the middle of sequences and the static graph shows it calls metal_run_noblock/metal_finish_threads; its implementation may itself be non-returning or abort on error, which would render following code unreachable.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Need to know whether it returns normally or can block forever/abort/terminate the calling thread (e.g., by calling pthread_exit or similar). If it never returns or terminates the process, code after its calls (including later sections and the final return) could be unreachable.\n\n- metal_log: It is called on error paths before goto out. If metal_log can terminate the program or longjmp (i.e., is non-local-exit), the goto/out sequence and subsequent cleanup would be unreachable; if it only logs and returns, those paths remain reachable.\n\n- THREADS: The macro/constant value and definition are required to reason about array sizing and whether any compile-time constructs (e.g., zero) could change control flow or make loops/calls no-ops. A value of zero or other special semantics could make thread-creation calls be no-ops and change which paths are exercised.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread: Their prototypes and whether they perform actions that affect the caller's control flow (e.g., calling pthread_kill/exit from the creating thread via weird library hooks) are required to exclude exotic cases where thread entry functions affect the parent thread's reachability. At minimum we need to ensure they are ordinary thread entry functions that do not influence caller control flow.\n\n- ts_created (output parameter semantics): The effect of the output parameter passed to metal_run_noblock (whether it can be NULL, whether the function fails when the pointer is invalid, whether it triggers non-local-exit) can affect whether the call returns normally or not and thus whether subsequent code is reachable.\n\nCollecting the prototypes/implementations or authoritative documentation for the above symbols lets the analyzer determine if any called function is non-returning, aborts, longjmps, or otherwise makes later statements unreachable (thereby violating MISRA's rule on unreachable code)."
