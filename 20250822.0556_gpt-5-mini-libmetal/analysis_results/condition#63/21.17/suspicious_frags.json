  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no calls to any of the standard string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function only calls metal_run_noblock, metal_run, metal_finish_threads, and metal_log and performs a pointer cast (void *)tids; none of these are string.h functions themselves. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that directly fall under Rule 21.17 and need investigation for out-of-bounds accesses caused by string.h usage. Note: if any of the called functions (metal_run*, metal_finish_threads, metal_log) are implemented elsewhere and internally use string.h functions, those implementations should be inspected in their own translation units; however, such code is not present in this fragment and thus is outside the scope of this review."
