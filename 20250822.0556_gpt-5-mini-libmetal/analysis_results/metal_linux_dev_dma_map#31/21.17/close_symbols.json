  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed:\n\n- struct linux_device: metal_linux_dev_dma_map dereferences ldev->ldrv. We need the struct layout and types to confirm ldrv is the expected pointer and to locate the dev_dma_map field.\n\n- struct linux_bus: passed directly into dev_dma_map; its layout may influence how buffers/lengths are computed inside the driver implementation.\n\n- struct linux_driver (type of ldev->ldrv): the driver structure defines the dev_dma_map member (its type and semantics). Knowing the exact type is required to find and inspect the target function(s).\n\n- prototype/typedef of ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map (function pointer): the signature (parameter types, const/non-const) is necessary to understand how pointers and lengths are passed and whether string.h functions could be invoked with sizes derived from these parameters.\n\n- implementations of all functions assigned to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map: the target function merely dispatches to this callback. Any use of string.h (memcpy, memset, strlen, etc.) that could access beyond bounds will occur inside those implementations; they must be inspected to determine rule violation.\n\n- to_linux_device (definition): to confirm that the conversion/cast from metal_device to linux_device is safe and does not alter pointer/size assumptions used later (and to see if it performs any pointer arithmetic or buffer accesses that might use string functions).\n\n- to_linux_bus (definition): same reason as to_linux_device for bus conversion/cast.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): scatter-gather entries contain buffer pointers and lengths; to determine whether memcpy/memmove/memset calls in dev_dma_map or helpers access beyond the referenced objects, we must know the fields and semantics of metal_sg.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition) and struct metal_device (definition): to verify what data is embedded in these objects (e.g., length fields, buffer pointers) and whether any implicit assumptions could cause out-of-bounds string operations when passed through to driver code.\n\n- implementations and prototypes of helper functions called (transitively) by the dev_dma_map implementations: dev_dma_map may call helper utilities (string wrappers, buffer copy helpers). To fully determine any string.h misuse you must inspect these helpers as well.\n\nIn short: because metal_linux_dev_dma_map simply forwards parameters to a driver callback, the analysis must include the callback's declaration and implementations (and any code they call), plus the concrete definitions of the involved structures and conversion functions, to detect any calls to <string.h> functions that could access beyond object bounds."
