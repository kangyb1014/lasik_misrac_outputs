  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code: metal_linux_dev_dma_map and the two helpers to_linux_device and to_linux_bus. There are no conditional branches, labels, gotos, or code statements after a return that would make any fragment statically unreachable. Both helper functions are trivial container_of wrappers that simply return a pointer; they contain no unreachable code. The only operation in metal_linux_dev_dma_map is a direct return of the result of calling a function-pointer member (ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map). A NULL function-pointer or NULL pointer dereference would be a runtime fault, not statically unreachable code, so it is outside the scope of MISRA Rule 2.1. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that appear to be unreachable and require investigation under Rule 2.1."
