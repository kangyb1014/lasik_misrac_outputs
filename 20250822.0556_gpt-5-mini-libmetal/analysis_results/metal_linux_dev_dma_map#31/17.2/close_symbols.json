  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_dma_map can call itself (directly or indirectly) you must resolve every possible call target and follow their call chains back to the target. The target function itself calls two helpers and one indirect function pointer; each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- to_linux_device: inspect its body to confirm it does not call metal_linux_dev_dma_map (or return a structure that causes an indirect call back to the target).\n\n- to_linux_bus: same reason as above for the bus conversion helper.\n\n- struct linux_device: needed to see the layout and the ldrv member (type and how it is set) so you can locate the driver pointer used in the indirect call.\n\n- struct linux_bus: inspect contents if the bus object can carry callbacks or references that could lead back to the target via the dev_dma_map call.\n\n- struct linux_driver (ldrv): required to identify the dev_dma_map member (its type and semantics) and where that member is initialized/assigned.\n\n- linux_driver::dev_dma_map (the function-pointer member): the indirect call in the target invokes this pointer; you must resolve this member to concrete functions to see potential recursion.\n\n- All concrete implementations assigned to linux_driver::dev_dma_map: each function that can be called via ldrv->dev_dma_map must be examined for direct or indirect calls to metal_linux_dev_dma_map. Any one of these implementations could call back into the target.\n\n- Transitive callees of each dev_dma_map implementation: for each implementation, you must follow its call graph transitively (functions it calls, and so on) to see whether any path leads back to metal_linux_dev_dma_map (indirect recursion).\n\nIn short: besides the two local helpers (to_linux_device/to_linux_bus), the critical work is resolving the indirect call ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map and the entire call graph reachable from each concrete implementation of that function-pointer. Only by inspecting those symbols and their transitive callees can you prove absence or presence of (direct or indirect) recursion."
