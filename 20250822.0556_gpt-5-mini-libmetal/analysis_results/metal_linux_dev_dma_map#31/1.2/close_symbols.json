  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_dma_map uses any compiler language extensions you must examine not only this wrapper but the symbols it relies on and any macros used to obtain the linux_* objects or call sites. Specifically:\n\n- to_linux_device (definition): the wrapper calls this; it may be a macro that performs an implementation-defined/extension cast (e.g., container_of) or use non\u2011standard builtins. You must inspect its actual definition.\n\n- to_linux_bus (definition): same reason as above for the bus conversion.\n\n- container_of (macro) or other macro used inside to_linux_device/to_linux_bus: kernel-style helpers frequently use container_of which can use compiler extensions. The exact macro used must be examined.\n\n- typeof (GCC/compiler built-in): container_of in many codebases uses typeof \u2014 a known GCC extension. If typeof appears in any conversion macro, that is a direct language extension violation to report.\n\n- struct linux_device (full definition): needed to see the ldrv member's type and whether any nonstandard attributes or bit\u2011fields/extension constructs are present in the structure definition.\n\n- struct linux_bus (full definition): the bus object is passed to dev_dma_map; inspect for any extension usage in its definition.\n\n- type of ldrv and its dev_dma_map member declaration/prototype: the code dereferences ldrv->dev_dma_map and calls it. You need the exact declaration/signature to check for attributes using compiler extensions (for example, __attribute__((...)), unusual calling conventions, or nonstandard types).\n\n- dev_dma_map function-pointer prototype (signature and any attributes): a direct place where attributes or extension types could appear; must be checked.\n\n- struct metal_device, struct metal_bus, struct metal_sg (definitions): these are the API types being converted/forwarded. Their definitions may include macros or attributes that are compiler extensions (or reveal how the conversion macros operate).\n\nInspecting these symbols will allow the analyzer to detect explicit compiler extensions (builtins, typeof, __attribute__, statement expressions, inline asm, etc.) used either in the conversion macros or in the declarations invoked by this wrapper. Only with those definitions can one determine if the target function (or the symbols it relies on) uses language extensions subject to the MISRA rule."
