  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C constructs only: a static function definition, standard struct pointer declarations, a call through a function pointer (ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map), and the standard fixed-width integer type uint32_t. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC/Clang builtins, inline assembly, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions)."
