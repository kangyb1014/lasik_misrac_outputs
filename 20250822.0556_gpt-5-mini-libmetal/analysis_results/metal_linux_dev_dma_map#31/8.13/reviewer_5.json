True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function to_linux_device takes a non-const pointer (struct metal_device *device) even though it does not modify the object; therefore the parameter (and correspondingly the returned pointer) could and should be const-qualified. As written, constness cannot be preserved (calls that have a const struct metal_device * would need a cast), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A compliant signature would be, for example, 'static const struct linux_device *to_linux_device(const struct metal_device *device)' (or provide both const and non-const variants), so the current code violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstatic struct linux_device *to_linux_device(struct metal_device *device)\n{\n\treturn metal_container_of(device, struct linux_device, device);\n}\n...\nstatic struct linux_bus *to_linux_bus(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\treturn metal_container_of(bus, struct linux_bus, bus);\n}\n...\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n...\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends using pointers to const when the pointee is not modified through that pointer, but that must be judged in the context of all uses of the pointer and the API. In this code: to_linux_device and metal_linux_dev_dma_map are static helpers that obtain the enclosing struct linux_device from a struct metal_device. Although the container_of implementation does not itself modify the object, the returned linux_device pointer is subsequently used in a call to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map (and likely other call sites) that expect a mutable struct linux_device *. Making to_linux_device return a const linux_device * (or changing metal_linux_dev_dma_map to take a const struct metal_device *) would not be obviously possible without changing those APIs and all call sites that mutate or expect a non-const linux_device. MISRA\u2019s \u201cwhenever possible\u201d requires that const qualification be applied only when it is compatible with all uses; here there is no evidence that the linux_device is never modified. Therefore the claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is unsupported."
