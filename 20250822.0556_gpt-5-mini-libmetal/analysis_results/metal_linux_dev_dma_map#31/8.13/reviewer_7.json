In particular, 'struct metal_bus *bus' should be 'const struct metal_bus *bus' if the device only refers to its bus and does not modify it. Likewise, the generic 'void *irq_info' could be 'const void *irq_info' if the IRQ information is read-only. ('name' is already const-qualified.) If these pointers are only used for reading, the lack of const qualification violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstatic struct linux_device *to_linux_device(struct metal_device *device)\n{\n\treturn metal_container_of(device, struct linux_device, device);\n}\n...\nstatic struct linux_bus *to_linux_bus(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\treturn metal_container_of(bus, struct linux_bus, bus);\n}\n...\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n...\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends using const for pointer targets that are never modified, but you must show that the pointed-to objects are in fact immutable in the API and all call sites. In the shown code: 1) metal_linux_dev_dma_map simply forwards its bus and device pointers to other APIs (to_linux_bus/to_linux_device and ldrv->dev_dma_map) that are declared to take non-const pointers; there is no proof those callees do not modify the objects. 2) The helper container_of/to_linux_* functions and the dev_dma_map callback signatures expect non-const pointers, so changing the parameters to const would be an API break unless all related prototypes are adjusted. 3) Fields like irq_info and bus might be written elsewhere in the codebase (no evidence they are read-only). Therefore the claim that these pointers \u201cshould\u201d be const (and that the code thus violates 8.13) is speculative. To legitimately flag a MISRA 8.13 violation you must demonstrate that a pointer target is never modified anywhere and can be made const without breaking the API; that proof is absent here. Conclusion: the reported violation is incorrect."
