  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be to const-qualified types when possible, but demonstrating a violation requires evidence that the pointed-to object is never modified through that pointer (or through any alias) across the program. In the snippets shown: (a) the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_map does not access linux_bus->sbus at all, (b) linux_bus->sbus is declared as a plain pointer but there is no code shown proving that the sysfs_bus object is never modified via that pointer or otherwise. Without a whole-program (or at least module-level) analysis showing that sbus is only read, you cannot conclude the member should be const. Therefore the claim is speculative; based on the available code the report is not correct. If, however, a project-wide review shows sbus is never used to modify the sysfs_bus object (and no API requires a non-const pointer), then changing it to const struct sysfs_bus *sbus would be appropriate to satisfy Rule 8.13."
