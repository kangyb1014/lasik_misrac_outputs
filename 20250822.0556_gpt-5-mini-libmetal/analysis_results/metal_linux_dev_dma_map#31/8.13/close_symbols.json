  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA guideline that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible you must know the exact types, casts and called-function signatures to determine whether the pointers passed here could/should be const. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_sg: needed to know the pointed-to data layout and whether sg_in is intended to be immutable (should be const struct metal_sg *) or mutated by the call. The presence/absence of const in its declaration is directly relevant.\n\n- struct metal_device: to see whether device should be a const-qualified pointer and whether any casting in to_linux_device affects constness.\n\n- struct metal_bus: same reason as struct metal_device \u2014 to decide if bus could/should be const and to confirm types used by conversion helpers.\n\n- to_linux_device: the helper/macro may perform a cast that removes or adds const qualification; you must inspect it to determine whether const is being discarded or if the conversion requires non-const.\n\n- to_linux_bus: same as to_linux_device \u2014 the conversion may change pointer constness and affects whether the original parameter types should be const.\n\n- struct linux_device: needed to see the ldrv member type (and whether linux_device fields are const-qualified) and to confirm what pointer types are passed into dev_dma_map.\n\n- struct linux_bus: to verify the exact parameter type expected by dev_dma_map and whether the bus pointer should be const-qualified.\n\n- type of ldev->ldrv (driver struct) including its dev_dma_map member: you must inspect the driver struct to find the declaration of dev_dma_map (its function-pointer type) and see the parameter types and const qualifiers there. That determines whether this call requires non-const pointers or could accept const pointers.\n\n- prototype/implementation of dev_dma_map: the actual function pointer prototype and/or implementation shows whether the function mutates sg_in, sg_out, device or bus. If dev_dma_map does not modify a pointed object, MISRA suggests that the corresponding parameter to metal_linux_dev_dma_map could be const; if it does modify it, const is not possible. The prototype also may already use const-qualified parameters, which affects whether this wrapper violates the rule.\n\nThese symbols together let you determine whether any pointer parameters in metal_linux_dev_dma_map (bus, device, sg_in, sg_out) can/should be declared to point to const-qualified types and whether any const qualification is being cast away by the conversion helpers or by the call into dev_dma_map."
