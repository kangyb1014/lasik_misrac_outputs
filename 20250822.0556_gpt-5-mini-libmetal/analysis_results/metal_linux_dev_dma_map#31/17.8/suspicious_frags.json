  "explanation": "No code fragment in metal_linux_dev_dma_map modifies any of the function parameters. The parameters (bus, device, dir, sg_in, nents_in, sg_out) are only read or forwarded: bus/device are passed to to_linux_bus/to_linux_device (which compute container pointers and do not write to the parameters), and all parameters are forwarded to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map without reassignment. There are no assignments to the parameter variables (e.g., no 'bus = ...' or 'device = ...') nor writes to the pointer variables themselves. Although the callee dev_dma_map may modify the objects pointed to by sg_out or sg_in (which is permitted by Rule 17.8), this function does not modify any pointer parameters and therefore does not violate the rule."
