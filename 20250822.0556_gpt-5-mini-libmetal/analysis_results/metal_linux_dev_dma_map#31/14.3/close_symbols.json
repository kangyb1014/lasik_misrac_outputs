  "explanation": "to_linux_device \u2014 the implementation (or macro) must be inspected because it may contain control statements (if/while/switch) or other invariant controlling expressions that would make the target function violate the MISRA rule when inlined or expanded.\nto_linux_bus \u2014 same reason as to_linux_device: it may be an inline function or macro that contains controlling expressions; those must be analyzed to determine if any controlling expressions are invariant.\nstruct linux_device \u2014 needed to know the layout and types of members (especially ldrv) and to determine whether accessing ldev->ldrv is a simple expression or expands to something with control flow.\nstruct linux_bus \u2014 needed because lbus is passed to the called driver function; its definition may reveal macros/inline behaviour tied into to_linux_bus and potential control expressions.\nstruct linux_driver (ldrv) / dev_dma_map member declaration \u2014 the type and declaration of ldrv and its dev_dma_map member are required to know whether dev_dma_map is a function pointer, macro, or inline function (which could contain control expressions). If dev_dma_map is a macro/inline, it may introduce invariant controlling expressions into the effective code of the target function.\nstruct metal_device \u2014 to_linux_device will typically cast or container_of from metal_device; the definition is required to understand any casting/macros used and whether they introduce control expressions.\nstruct metal_bus \u2014 same rationale for to_linux_bus and for understanding whether conversions are pure casts or contain control-flow.\ncontainer_of / cast macros used by to_linux_device/to_linux_bus \u2014 common implementations of to_linux_* use container_of or similar macros; those macros or casts may hide control expressions or side-effects and must be inspected for invariant controlling expressions.\n\nConcise rationale: the target function itself has no explicit controlling statements, so the only possible MISRA violations would come from inlined/macroified conversions (to_linux_device/to_linux_bus) or from treating ldrv->dev_dma_map as a macro/inline expression. The above symbols cover those potential sources of controlling expressions."
