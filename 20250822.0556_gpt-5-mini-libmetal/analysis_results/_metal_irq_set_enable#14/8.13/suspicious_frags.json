  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 recommends const-qualification for pointer targets when they are not modified. The listed fragments are all places where non-const pointers to struct metal_irq_controller or related data are declared, returned, assigned, or passed to callbacks; each of these should be checked to determine whether the pointed-to objects are actually modified and therefore require a non-const pointer, or whether they could and should be const-qualified. Other code fragments in the provided excerpts were not included because they do not introduce pointer-to-object types that could reasonably be made const (e.g. the integer parameter 'irq', the NULL checks, loop control, local integer temporaries irq_base/irq_end, or the return of NULL), or they are simple control-flow statements that do not affect pointer constness. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
