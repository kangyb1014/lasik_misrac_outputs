    "static void _metal_irq_set_enable(int irq, unsigned int state)",
    "metal_irq_set_enable irq_set_enable; /**< function to set IRQ enable */",
    "cntr->irq_set_enable(cntr, irq, state);"
  ],
  "explanation": "No other code fragments modify any function parameters. Inside _metal_irq_set_enable the parameters irq and state are only passed (by value) and never assigned to; cntr is a local variable initialized from metal_irq_get_controller and its assignment does not modify any function parameter. The null check and return do not alter parameters. The remaining struct members are declarations (data members), not function parameters being modified. Therefore there are no other fragments in the provided code that warrant investigation under Rule 17.8."
