  "explanation": "- struct metal_irq_controller: needed to know the exact layout and the types of members (especially irq_set_enable) so you can determine what pointer/arguments are passed into any function that might call string.h routines.\\n- prototype/type of metal_irq_controller::irq_set_enable: the function-pointer signature (parameter types and widths) is required to ensure correct interpretation of the irq and state parameters and to detect any implicit conversions that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses when string functions are used.\\n- implementations of all concrete irq_set_enable functions: the target function delegates work to cntr->irq_set_enable. Any violation of the <string.h> bound rule would occur in those implementations, so you must inspect each to see if they call memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc. and whether buffer sizes/lengths are correct.\\n- metal_irq_get_controller (implementation): needed to determine which controller instance is returned for a given irq (and whether the mapping can yield unexpected controllers), and to locate the controller object whose irq_set_enable will be invoked.\\n- metal_irq_register and registration/initialization code/tables: these show how irq_set_enable pointers are assigned to controller instances (which implementations apply to which irq ranges). Without this you cannot know which concrete irq_set_enable is called for a given irq.\\n- definitions of global controller instances/objects referenced by metal_irq_get_controller: to find the exact function pointers and any controller-specific data (buffers, sizes) used by irq_set_enable implementations; necessary to verify any buffer boundaries used with string.h functions.\\nTogether these symbols let the analyst trace from _metal_irq_set_enable to the concrete code that might call string.h functions and check whether those calls could access beyond object bounds."
