  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The provided function contains no use of memcmp or any other string handling: it declares integer and pointer types, calls metal_irq_get_controller(irq), checks the returned pointer for NULL, and invokes a controller function pointer (cntr->irq_set_enable). There are no char* or C library string operations in this fragment. Any use of memcmp would be in other functions (e.g. metal_irq_get_controller or the implementation of irq_set_enable), but those implementations are not present in the supplied code and therefore cannot be investigated here."
