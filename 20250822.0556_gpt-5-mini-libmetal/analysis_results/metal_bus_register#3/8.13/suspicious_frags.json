  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation with respect to Rule 8.13 because they clearly require a mutable (non-const) object or are not pointer-type declarations that could be const-qualified: metal_list_init(&bus->devices); and metal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node); operate on and modify members of bus (devices/node), so the function parameter must not be const-qualified. The pointer null-check (!bus) and the return statements are control-flow checks and not candidates for changing the pointed-to type to const. The NULL second argument passed to metal_bus_find is not a pointer-to-data candidate for const-qualification in this context. These remaining lines therefore do not warrant further Rule 8.13 investigation."
