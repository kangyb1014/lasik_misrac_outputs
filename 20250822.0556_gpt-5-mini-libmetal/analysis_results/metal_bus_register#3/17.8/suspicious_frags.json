  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the parameter variable 'bus' itself (there is no assignment to 'bus' or reassignment of the pointer). The function only: (1) reads bus and its members (e.g. bus->name, strlen(bus->name)), (2) passes the pointer/member addresses to other functions (e.g. metal_list_init(&bus->devices), metal_list_add_tail(..., &bus->node)), and (3) may modify the object pointed to by 'bus' (initializing members), which is permitted by Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no fragments that violate the rule and nothing else needs investigation."
