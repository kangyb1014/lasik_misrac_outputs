  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_bus_register:\n```c\nint metal_bus_register(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\tif (!bus || !bus->name || !strlen(bus->name))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\tif (metal_bus_find(bus->name, NULL) == 0)\n\t\treturn -EEXIST;\n\tmetal_list_init(&bus->devices);\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node);\n\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"registered %s bus\\n\", bus->name);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: metal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node) has an observable side effect \u2014 it inserts the bus node into the global bus_list. That affects subsequent operations (lookups, enumeration, removal, lifecycle management); removing the call would change program behaviour. (It would only be dead if metal_list_add_tail were effectively a no-op or the bus_list is never read anywhere in the program.)"
