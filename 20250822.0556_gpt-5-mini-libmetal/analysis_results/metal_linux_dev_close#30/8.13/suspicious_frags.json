  "explanation": "I flagged all pointer declarations and uses in the provided fragments that could plausibly be const-qualified: the function parameters (bus, device), the local pointer variables (ldev, lbus), the call that passes those pointers to dev_close (which may accept non-modifying pointers), and pointer fields in struct metal_device (bus, irq_info). I did NOT flag: - const char *name (already const-qualified), - regions and node (they are array/value members, not pointer types needing const qualification), - metal_list_del(&device->node) and free(ldev) (these operations modify or deallocate the object or require mutable pointers, so const-qualification would be inappropriate), and - other non-pointer members (irq_num, etc.). These were therefore not included as suspicious under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
