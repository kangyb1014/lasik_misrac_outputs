If the helper functions to_linux_bus() and ldev->ldrv->dev_close() do not modify the bus pointed-to, then the parameter (and any stored references) should be const-qualified \u2014 e.g. 'const struct metal_bus *bus' \u2014 to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "explanation": "The agent's claim is speculative. MISRA 8.13 asks that pointers be to const-qualified types when possible, but whether that applies here depends on the callees and the intended semantics. In this function 'bus' is immediately converted with to_linux_bus(bus) and passed to ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev). We do not have the prototypes for to_linux_bus() or dev_close(); if those APIs take non-const pointers or mutate the bus, the parameter cannot be made const. Also the containing struct metal_device stores a non-const 'struct metal_bus *bus', so the surrounding API already uses mutable pointers. Given the missing callee signatures and the likely external API expectations, there is insufficient evidence that 'bus' can safely be const-qualified here. Therefore the report of a definite MISRA 8.13 violation is not justified. (If, in fact, all callees are const-correct and do not modify the bus, then changing the parameter to 'const struct metal_bus *' would be advisable.)"
