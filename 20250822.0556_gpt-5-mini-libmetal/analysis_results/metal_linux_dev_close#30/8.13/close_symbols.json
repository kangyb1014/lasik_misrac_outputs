  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: The target function takes struct metal_device *device and accesses device->node; knowing the exact member type and qualifiers is required to see whether device (or its node) could have been declared const.\\n- metal_list_del prototype: The function is called with &device->node; its parameter types and whether it mutates the node determine whether the node (and thus device) must be non-const.\\n- list-node type (device->node): If the node type is a separate struct, its definition shows which fields are modified by metal_list_del and whether they require non-const pointers.\\n- to_linux_device declaration: This conversion/macro/inline determines whether the conversion from struct metal_device * to struct linux_device * involves const casts or discards const qualification; it affects whether the original parameter could be const.\\n- struct linux_device: The function obtains ldev and later frees it; the struct definition (and any const qualifiers on its fields) is needed to decide if the pointer types could be const-qualified.\\n- driver struct (ldev->ldrv) type: ldev->ldrv->dev_close is invoked; knowing the driver struct type gives access to the dev_close member and its signature.\\n- dev_close prototype: The dev_close function pointer signature (parameter types and const qualifiers for lbus and ldev) is essential to determine whether the pointers passed must be non-const or could be const-qualified.\\n- to_linux_bus declaration: As with to_linux_device, this conversion may add/remove const qualification; its definition matters for const-correctness analysis.\\n- struct linux_bus: dev_close is passed lbus; the linux_bus definition (and its qualifiers) is needed to evaluate whether lbus could be const.\\n- struct metal_bus: The function receives struct metal_bus *bus and converts it to linux_bus; the metal_bus definition (and any constness in conversion) helps decide whether bus could be const.\\nCollectively these symbols let an analyzer determine which pointers are mutated directly or via callees and whether any parameters or derived pointers could be safely const-qualified in accordance with the MISRA rule."
