  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 indeed advises that pointers should be to const-qualified types when they are not used to modify the pointed-to object, but the evidence provided is insufficient to show a violation. The function metal_linux_dev_close does not access or modify device->irq_info, and the excerpt of struct metal_device only shows the field declared as void *irq_info; whether that is a MISRA violation depends on how irq_info is used elsewhere. If irq_info is never used to modify the pointed-to object then it would be appropriate to change its type to const void * and that would address Rule 8.13; if the pointed-to object is legitimately modified via this pointer then void * is correct and there is no violation. In short: the agent's claim is speculative and not proven by the code shown, so the report is not correct as presented."
