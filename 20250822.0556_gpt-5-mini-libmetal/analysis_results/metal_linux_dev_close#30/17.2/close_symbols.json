  "explanation": "- struct linux_device: required to know the type and name of the ldrv field (ldev->ldrv) so we can trace what driver instance and callback pointer are involved.\n- struct linux_driver: required to see the declaration/type of the dev_close member (signature and whether it is a function pointer) so we can identify possible call targets and call semantics.\n- ldrv->dev_close (function pointer): the indirect call in the target goes through this pointer; we must treat it as a potential call site and resolve its possible targets to detect recursion.\n- implementations of linux_driver::dev_close (all functions that can be assigned to dev_close): to determine whether any of those implementations call back (directly or indirectly) to metal_linux_dev_close. Any such implementation creates indirect recursion.\n- functions that assign ldev->ldrv (e.g. metal_linux_dev_open and driver-registration/initialization functions): required to find which linux_driver instances can be assigned to ldev->ldrv at runtime so we can limit the set of dev_close implementations to analyze.\n- to_linux_device: included to confirm this helper does not itself call back to metal_linux_dev_close (it appears simple, but must be checked to rule out recursion).\n- to_linux_bus: same reason as to_linux_device \u2014 ensure it cannot lead to a path back to metal_linux_dev_close.\n- metal_list_del: although unlikely, it is a callee of the target; include it to verify it does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_linux_dev_close.\n\nIn short, the crucial unresolved symbol is the indirect callback ldrv->dev_close and the concrete functions that can populate it. Those implementations and the code paths that assign the driver pointer are required to determine whether metal_linux_dev_close can (directly or indirectly) call itself and thus violate the MISRA recursion rule."
