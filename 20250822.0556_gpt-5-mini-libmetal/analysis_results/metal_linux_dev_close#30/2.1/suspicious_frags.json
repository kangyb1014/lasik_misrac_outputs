  "explanation": "Only the three statements shown were identified as needing further investigation for potential unreachable-code issues. No other fragments in the function were flagged because:\n- The function signature and parameter list are normal and do not constitute unreachable code.\n- The local declarations (to_linux_device/to_linux_bus assignments) are simple initializations executed before any calls and contain no control-flow that would render subsequent code unreachable.\n- There are no return, goto, infinite-loop, or conditional compilation constructs elsewhere in this function that would create other unreachable statements.\nThus, investigation should focus on the listed statements (they involve an external call and subsequent statements) to determine whether any of them can be rendered unreachable at compile time or by attributes/behavior of called functions."
