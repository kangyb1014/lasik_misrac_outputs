  "explanation": "Explain why each is needed to check for unreachable code:\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition, especially dev_close member prototype and attributes): The key potential source of unreachable code is the call ldev->ldrv->dev_close(...). If dev_close is declared or attributed as non\u2011returning (noreturn) then any code after that call in metal_linux_dev_close is statically unreachable. You must see the dev_close prototype and any attributes to determine whether it can be treated as non\u2011returning.\n\n- implementations of linux_driver->dev_close (all driver dev_close function declarations/definitions): Even if the function pointer type is not annotated, the actual functions assigned to dev_close may themselves be implemented as non\u2011returning (call exit(), longjmp(), infinite loop, or declared noreturn). To conclude whether the subsequent metal_list_del and free are reachable you must inspect the possible target functions actually assigned to dev_close at initialization.\n\n- struct linux_device (definition, to see ldev->ldrv member): You need the layout to confirm the existence and type of ldev->ldrv and ensure there is no inlined behavior/macros that change the call semantics (e.g., if ldev->ldrv is a macro or wrapper that could embed non\u2011returning code).\n\n- to_linux_device (definition): Although less likely, these helper functions could themselves contain non\u2011returning behavior (or be implemented as macros) that would make later code unreachable. Inspecting them rules that out.\n\n- to_linux_bus (definition): Same reason as to_linux_device \u2014 ensure conversion cannot itself be non\u2011returning or otherwise make later statements unreachable.\n\n- driver registration/initialization sites that assign ldev->ldrv (locations/objects that enumerate possible linux_driver instances): To determine the set of possible dev_close targets you must find where linux_driver instances are created/registered and what functions they assign into dev_close; this lets you determine exhaustively whether all possible targets are non\u2011returning (which would make later statements unreachable) or some return normally (so code is reachable).\n\n- project noreturn/attribute macros (e.g. __noreturn, __attribute__((noreturn))): Non\u2011returning annotations may be placed via project macros. Knowing how noreturn is expressed lets you detect non\u2011returning declarations even if they use project\u2011specific macros.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the next analyst determine whether the call to dev_close (or any earlier called helper) can be known statically to never return, which is the only realistic way statements after that call would be unreachable in this function and thus potentially violate the MISRA rule."
