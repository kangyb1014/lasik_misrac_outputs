  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the presented code: metal_list_del(&device->node); is reachable in normal control flow because there is no return, goto, or other construct that guarantees it cannot be executed. (Only if ldev->ldrv->dev_close is known to be non\u2011returning \u2014 e.g. annotated noreturn or implemented to always call exit/longjmp) would the following metal_list_del become unreachable, which would then violate Rule 2.1."
