  "explanation": "to_linux_device: This conversion may be a macro or inline function (often using container_of or casts). If it expands into code with conditionals/loops, those become controlling expressions in the body of metal_linux_dev_close and must be examined for invariance. to_linux_bus: same reason as above for bus conversion. container_of (or macro used by the above): If the conversion macros use container_of or other macros that expand to code, those expansions can contain controlling expressions; include the exact macro(s) used. struct linux_device (definition): Needed to see whether any field accesses (ldrv) are themselves macros or inline functions and to understand whether any implicit operations occur at the call site. struct linux_bus (definition): For the same reason as linux_device \u2014 to inspect any macro/inlined behaviour or hidden control flow passed to dev_close. struct linux_driver / type of ldev->ldrv and its dev_close member prototype: The call ldev->ldrv->dev_close may refer to a function-like macro, inline function or function pointer; we need the type and declaration to determine whether the call expands to code containing controlling expressions. implementations (or inlines/macros) of the driver dev_close(s) that can be invoked here: If dev_close is an inline function or macro (or if static analysis needs the body to check for invariant controlling expressions), include the actual implementation(s) that could be called. metal_list_del (definition/implementation): It is called from this function and may be a macro/inline that expands to control statements; include its code to verify it does not introduce invariant controlling expressions into this translation unit. free (declaration): Although unlikely to contain controlling expressions, include the declaration to rule out any macro replacement in this environment (and to be complete when analysing any expanded code)."
