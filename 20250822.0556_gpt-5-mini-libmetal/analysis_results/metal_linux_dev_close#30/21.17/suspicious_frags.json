  "explanation": "No direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code fragments (including to_linux_device/to_linux_bus and the container_of wrapper). metal_list_del and free do not involve string.h operations. However, the call ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev); is an indirect call into driver-provided code whose implementation is not present here; that implementation could use string.h functions and therefore must be inspected to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur. No other lines in the provided code require investigation for Rule 21.17 because they do not call the listed string-handling functions."
