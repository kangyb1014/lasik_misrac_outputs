Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "MISRA's requirement treats the behaviour of any functions called inside a for loop as part of the loop body. Although metal_linux_dev_close itself contains no for loops, it calls functions (and a function pointer) whose bodies might contain for loops; those loops would be considered part of the calling context when checking the rule. Therefore you must examine:\n\n- ldev->ldrv->dev_close (and all concrete functions that can be assigned to that pointer): the call is through a function pointer; any for loop inside any dev_close implementation invoked here would be executed in the dynamic context of metal_linux_dev_close and must be checked for the three-clause/one-counter constraints.\n- struct linux_driver: to resolve the dev_close prototype/signature so static analysis can locate and match all candidate implementations.\n- All implementations assigned to linux_driver::dev_close: to inspect their bodies for any for loops and verify they are well-formed per MISRA.\n- metal_list_del: this function is called directly; its body (and any loops inside it) counts toward the caller's analysis and must be inspected.\n- to_linux_device and to_linux_bus: though likely simple casts or helpers, their implementations must be checked for loops as they are directly called.\n- free: include the free implementation or stub used in this build/runtime (unlikely to contain loops relevant to MISRA, but include for completeness if project-provided allocator is used).\n- Transitive callees of the above: any function called by dev_close, metal_list_del, to_linux_device, to_linux_bus, or free may contain for loops; those loops are also part of the behaviour and must be checked.\n\nCollecting these symbols (and their implementations) lets the next analyzer determine whether any for loops reachable from metal_linux_dev_close violate the MISRA rule."
