  "explanation": "Other fragments were not reported because they do not present obvious violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the 'name' parameter and the struct metal_bus::name member are already const-qualified; usage of strcmp with const char * arguments is appropriate; the function return value and error handling are unrelated to pointer const-qualification; the struct metal_bus contains members that are non-pointer types or are containers (e.g. struct metal_list node, struct metal_list devices) where mutability is required for list operations; typical linked-list next/prev pointers and the iteration macro are expected to be mutable in order to modify the list, so they are not necessarily candidates for const-qualification without broader design changes. Based on the code shown, the listed fragments are the locations where pointer-to-non-const types are directly exposed or assigned and therefore warrant investigation for possible const-qualification."
