  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_bus_find:\n```c\nint metal_bus_find(const char *name, struct metal_bus **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.bus_list, node) {\n\t\tbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n\t\t\t*result = bus;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is an if-condition inside the loop body, not one of the for-statement clauses governed by Rule 14.2. It only reads bus->name and the pointer result and calls strcmp (which has no persistent side effects), so it does not contravene the requirements about loop counters, side effects or modifying objects in the loop clauses. (A violation would occur if a for-clause used an expression that had persistent side effects or used objects that are modified in the loop body \u2014 e.g. placing a call with side effects or a variable modified in the body into the for second/third clause.)"
