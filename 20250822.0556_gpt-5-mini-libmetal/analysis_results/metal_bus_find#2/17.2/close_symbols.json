  "explanation": "To prove the target (metal_bus_find) does or does not participate in recursion you must examine the other functions that form call edges to/from it (to detect any cycle back to metal_bus_find).\n\n- metal_bus_register: directly calls metal_bus_find (per call graph). Must inspect its body to see whether it (or functions it calls) can call back into metal_bus_find, creating indirect recursion.\n- metal_device_open: directly calls metal_bus_find. Inspect it to ensure it is not reached (directly or via other callees) from metal_bus_find.\n- metal_linux_bus_finish: directly calls metal_bus_find. Inspect to determine if there is any path from metal_bus_find back to metal_linux_bus_finish and then to metal_bus_find.\n- metal_bus_unregister: called by metal_linux_bus_finish; include because it could contain calls that lead back to metal_bus_find (contributing to an indirect cycle).\n- metal_list_init and metal_list_add_tail: called by metal_bus_register; include because they are immediate callees of a caller of metal_bus_find and could (in principle) lead to further calls that return to metal_bus_find.\n- metal_linux_register_bus: caller of metal_bus_register; include to check longer caller chains that might participate in a cycle involving metal_bus_find.\n- metal_sys_finish: caller of metal_linux_bus_finish; include for the same reason as metal_linux_register_bus \u2014 to examine higher-level caller chains that could complete an indirect recursion cycle.\n\nExamining the implementations of these symbols (their direct callees as well, if any) is necessary to determine whether any call path starts at metal_bus_find and eventually returns to it (directly or indirectly), which would violate the MISRA rule."
