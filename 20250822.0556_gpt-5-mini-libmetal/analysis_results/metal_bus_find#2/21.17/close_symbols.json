  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C string-bounds analysis:\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): Determines the type and storage of bus->name (e.g. char array with fixed size vs char *). The size, constness, and allocation semantics of name are essential to determine whether strcmp can read beyond the object bounds.\n\n- metal_bus_register: Likely the function that creates/initializes metal_bus instances and assigns bus->name. You must inspect how name is populated (copied, pointed-to, truncated) to know if it is NUL-terminated and sized correctly.\n\n- metal_device_open: A direct caller of metal_bus_find; you must inspect what it passes as the name parameter (e.g. pointer to a buffer, literal, or constructed string) to ensure that the argument is a valid NUL-terminated string and that reading it with strcmp cannot overrun its bounds.\n\n- metal_linux_bus_finish: Another caller of metal_bus_find; similarly, its construction/passing of the name argument needs inspection to ensure the passed string is properly terminated and within bounds.\n\n- _metal and _metal.common.bus_list (definitions): The function iterates this global list to obtain bus objects. Understanding how and when elements are added/removed and lifetimes of list entries is needed to ensure bus->name refers to valid storage when strcmp is called.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): Shows how the bus pointer is derived from the list node. Confirming the macro's semantics ensures that bus points to the correct containing struct and that accessing bus->name is well-defined (no pointer arithmetic mistakes that could change object bounds).\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro) / struct metal_list (definition): Understanding the iteration mechanism and the node type helps verify that the retrieved bus pointers are valid and properly aligned objects whose members (including name) can be safely accessed.\n\n- strcmp prototype (from <string.h>): To confirm the standard behavior of strcmp (it reads both strings up to and including the terminating NUL). This is needed to reason about required NUL-termination and maximum readable extent of both operands.\n\nCollecting and reviewing these symbols (definitions and call-sites) allows a complete determination of whether the strcmp usage in metal_bus_find can read past the bounds of either bus->name or the name argument, thereby violating the MISRA string-bounds rule."
