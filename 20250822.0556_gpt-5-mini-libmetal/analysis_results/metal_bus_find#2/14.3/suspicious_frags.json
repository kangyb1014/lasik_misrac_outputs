  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The only loop is the for generated by the macro metal_list_for_each, which expands to: for ((node) = (list)->next; (node) != (list); (node) = (node)->next). The controlling expression (node != (list)) is variant because node is updated on each iteration. The if expression (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) is a conditional, not a loop control, and is not invariant: strcmp depends on bus->name which changes with each list element (result is a parameter but alone does not make the whole expression invariant). There are no do-while constructs or explicit while/for constructs with constant conditions (e.g. while(1)) in the snippet. Other macros (metal_container_of, metal_offset_of) do not introduce controlling expressions here. Therefore no fragments require investigation under Rule 14.3."
