  "explanation": "You must inspect the precise loop controlling expression and the objects it depends on to decide whether it is invariant. For that you need:\n\n- metal_list_for_each: the macro/inline definition \u2014 this is the controlling loop construct in the code. Its expansion determines the exact controlling expression(s) (initialisation, test, and increment). Only by seeing the macro expansion can you tell whether the test expression depends on a changing loop variable or is a constant/invariant.\n\n- struct metal_list: the layout (fields such as next/prev or sentinel semantics). The loop test typically compares node against a list head or NULL; knowing the list node fields shows how node is updated and whether the test is based on mutable state.\n\n- _metal (and its type definition that declares common.bus_list): the definition of the global head used as the list argument. If the macro's test compares against the head or uses a sentinel, you must know whether that head expression is a compile-time invariant or a runtime object that can change \u2014 and whether it aliases node \u2014 to decide if the controlling expression can be invariant.\n\n- struct metal_bus: to know the types and fields accessed inside the loop (bus->node, bus->name). This shows whether the body modifies list state or the values used in the loop test, and whether the bus->name access could make the if-condition invariant (it generally will vary between iterations because bus changes).\n\n- metal_container_of: the macro used to obtain the containing struct from node. Its definition/expansion is needed to confirm how 'bus' is derived from 'node' and that the loop iteration actually advances over different container objects (so the if controlling expression depends on a changing 'bus').\n\n- strcmp: the semantics of the string comparison used in the if controlling expression. While standard, you should confirm it is not defined as an unusual compile-time macro in this codebase; it determines whether the if expression (strcmp(...) == 0 && result) can be considered invariant.\n\nThese symbols let you determine (a) how the for-loop controlling expression is formed and whether it is invariant, and (b) whether the if controlling expression can be invariant across iterations. Without them you cannot conclusively apply the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions."
