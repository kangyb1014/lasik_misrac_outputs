  "explanation": "The selected fragments are the only locations that can produce effectively dead behavior related to existence checking: the first is the match/return block inside metal_bus_find that conditions success on the caller-supplied result pointer; the second is the caller in metal_bus_register that invokes metal_bus_find with a NULL result and expects a 0 return to indicate an existing bus. Other code need not be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.2 in this context because:\n- Calls that pass a non-NULL result (e.g., metal_device_open and metal_linux_bus_finish) rely on metal_bus_find assigning and returning on success and therefore exercise the function\u2019s live behavior.\n- The list iteration macro (metal_list_for_each) and container macro (metal_container_of) are iteration/utility constructs and do not themselves introduce dead code here.\n- The final return -ENOENT in metal_bus_find is a reachable return for not-found cases and is not dead.\n- Input-validation branches (e.g., checks for NULL or empty strings in metal_bus_register and metal_device_open) are active runtime guards and not dead code.\nTherefore, aside from the two reported fragments that create a mismatch between caller expectation and callee behavior (leading to an effectively unreachable return in the caller), other fragments shown do not appear to constitute dead code relevant to Rule 2.2."
