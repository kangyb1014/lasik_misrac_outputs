  "explanation": "You must inspect the macro and type definitions used by metal_bus_find to decide if any compiler language extensions are used. Specifically:\n- metal_container_of (macro): container_of-style macros commonly use GNU extensions (typeof, statement-expression '({ ... })') or rely only on offsetof. You need the exact macro body to detect use of typeof, ({...}), __extension__, inline assembly, or other non\u2011standard constructs.\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): loop macros sometimes employ statement-expressions or other GCC extensions. Inspect its definition to check for ({...}), typeof, or other compiler-specific syntax.\n- struct metal_list (definition): the macro bodies may reference struct members or use pointer casts that depend on member types; you need the struct layout to understand any casts in the macros and confirm they are standard C.\n- struct metal_bus (definition): metal_container_of is used to compute a struct metal_bus pointer from a list node and may rely on member types/offsets; check the declaration to ensure no use of compiler extensions in field declarations (e.g., unnamed bit\u2011fields with implementation-defined behavior, custom attributes).\n- ENOENT (macro from errno.h): although standard, verify its definition is a simple macro/constant and not implemented via compiler-specific extension in the project headers.\n- offsetof (macro from stddef.h): if metal_container_of uses offsetof instead of typeof, offsetof is standard; include it to verify no replacement with non\u2011standard implementation.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the exact macro bodies and the two struct definitions, plus the errno/offsetof definitions) lets you determine whether the code relies on language extensions (typeof, statement expressions, compiler attributes, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
