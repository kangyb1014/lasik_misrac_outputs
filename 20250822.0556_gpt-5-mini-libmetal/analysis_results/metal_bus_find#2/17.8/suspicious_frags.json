  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself; it allows modifying the object the pointer points to. In this function: - The parameter 'name' is const and is not assigned to or modified. - The parameter 'result' is not reassigned (no statements like 'result = ...' or 'result++'). The only write involving 'result' is '*result = bus', which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter \u2014 this is permitted by the rule. All other variables (node, bus) are local and not parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
