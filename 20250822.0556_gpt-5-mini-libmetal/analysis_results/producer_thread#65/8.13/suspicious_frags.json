  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they involve pointers to objects that are clearly mutable or operations that do not involve pointer const-qualification: \n- Calls that pass addresses of synchronization objects (metal_mutex_acquire(&lock), metal_condition_wait(&nfull_condv, &lock), metal_condition_signal(&nempty_condv), metal_mutex_release(&lock)) provide pointers to data that the called APIs are expected to modify, so const-qualification would be inappropriate. \n- The use of counter (while (counter == COUNTER_MAX) and counter++) reads or modifies a plain integer, not a pointer type relevant to Rule 8.13. \n- return NULL; returns a null pointer constant and does not indicate a need for const-qualification of any pointed-to type in this fragment.\n\nThe only locations where a pointer could plausibly be const-qualified are the function parameter void *arg (it is unused) and its explicit discard via (void)arg;, which is why those fragments are reported for further review."
