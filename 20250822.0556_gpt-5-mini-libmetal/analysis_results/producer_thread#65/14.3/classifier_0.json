  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The loop is a standard condition-variable wait: the controlling expression 'counter == COUNTER_MAX' is not an invariant because metal_condition_wait(...) is expected to release the mutex and block, allowing other threads to modify 'counter' and signal the condition. Thus the expression can change across iterations and the rule is not violated."
