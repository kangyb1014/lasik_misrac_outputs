  "explanation": "To determine whether the controlling expression while (counter == COUNTER_MAX) is invariant, the analyzer must know whether counter can change while the loop is executing or blocked. Each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- counter (declaration and definition): needed to know its type, storage duration, and qualifiers (e.g. volatile, atomic). If counter is not modifiable or is a compile-time constant the expression may be invariant.\n\n- COUNTER_MAX (macro/constant definition): needed to know whether COUNTER_MAX is truly constant and its value/type; also to detect any potential compile-time evaluation that would make the comparison invariant.\n\n- lock (mutex object declaration): the code holds this lock around the loop; the lock's type/semantics confirm mutual exclusion scope and whether other threads can change counter while the lock is held.\n\n- nfull_condv, nempty_condv (condition variable declarations): their existence and semantics matter because waiting/signalling on these condition variables is how other threads can coordinate changes to counter.\n\n- metal_condition_wait (implementation or specification): crucial to know whether this function atomically releases the mutex and blocks, and then reacquires the mutex on wake-up. If wait does release the lock, other threads can modify counter while producer is blocked, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- metal_mutex_release (implementation or specification): to confirm that when condition_wait releases the mutex it indeed allows other threads to acquire it and modify shared state.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (implementation or specification): to confirm that the mutex semantics restore mutual exclusion and ordering on reacquire (important for reasoning about visibility of modifications to counter after wake-up).\n\n- metal_condition_signal (implementation or specification): to confirm how waiters are woken (e.g. whether a signal actually unblocks a waiting thread), and thus whether another thread can change counter and notify the producer.\n\n- consumer_thread (implementation): needed to determine whether any other thread (the consumer) actually modifies counter (decrements it) and signals the condition; this proves that counter can change while producer is waiting.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired (implementation or specification): referenced by the wait implementation (per the call graph) and useful to verify preconditions of wait (e.g. wait requires the mutex be held) and internal correctness of releasing/reacquiring semantics.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyzer decide if counter can change while the loop is active (so the controlling expression is not invariant) or if it truly cannot change (violating MISRA C rule on invariant controlling expressions)."
