  "explanation": "No function parameter variables are assigned or otherwise modified in the provided code fragments, so there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to investigate. Details:\n\n- producer_thread(void *arg): The only use of the parameter is the discard cast (void)arg; which is not a modification of the parameter. The function does not assign to arg or change the pointer value.\n\n- metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv, metal_mutex_t *m): Neither cv nor m is assigned to anywhere in the function. Operations that occur are:\n  - Reading the pointers in checks (if (!cv || !m ...)) \u2014 permitted.\n  - Casting m to an integer into a separate local (mptr = (uintptr_t)m) \u2014 this creates/modifies a local variable, not the parameter.\n  - atomic_compare_exchange_strong mutates the local tmpmptr and potentially the object pointed to by cv (cv->mptr), but it does not assign to the parameter variable cv itself. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule.\n  - metal_mutex_release(m) and metal_mutex_acquire(m) operate on the object pointed to by m (allowed); they do not change the parameter variable m.\n  - atomic_fetch_add/sub operate on fields of *cv (allowed) and do not modify the parameter variable.\n\nBecause none of the function parameter identifiers (arg, cv, m) are assigned a new value in these fragments, there are no suspicious code fragments with respect to Rule 17.8."
