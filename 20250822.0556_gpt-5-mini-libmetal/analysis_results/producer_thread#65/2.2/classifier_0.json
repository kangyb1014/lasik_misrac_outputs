The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of producer_thread:\n```c\nstatic void *producer_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\t(void)arg;\n\tmetal_mutex_acquire(&lock);\n\twhile (counter == COUNTER_MAX)\n\t\tmetal_condition_wait(&nfull_condv, &lock);\n\tcounter++;\n\tmetal_condition_signal(&nempty_condv);\n\tmetal_mutex_release(&lock);\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function producer_thread:\nstatic unsigned int counter\n...\n#define COUNTER_MAX 10\n...\nMETAL_MUTEX_DEFINE(lock)\n...\nstatic struct metal_condition nfull_condv = METAL_CONDITION_INIT\n...\nstatic struct metal_condition nempty_condv = METAL_CONDITION_INIT\n...\nstatic void *consumer_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\t(void)arg;\n\tmetal_mutex_acquire(&lock);\n\twhile (!counter)\n\t\tmetal_condition_wait(&nempty_condv, &lock);\n\tcounter--;\n\tmetal_condition_signal(&nfull_condv);\n\tmetal_mutex_release(&lock);\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void)arg;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The statement '(void)arg;' in producer_thread is an evaluated expression used only to suppress an unused-parameter warning. It has no side effects (arg is a plain void * parameter) and removing it would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If 'arg' were declared volatile, the read could have side effects, but in the provided code it is not.)"
