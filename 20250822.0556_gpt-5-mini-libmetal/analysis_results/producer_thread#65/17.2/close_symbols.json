  "explanation": "To prove the producer_thread does not (directly or indirectly) call itself, we must examine the transitive callees of producer_thread. Include:\n\n- metal_condition_wait: producer_thread directly calls this; it can introduce further call chains that might lead back to producer_thread.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: producer_thread directly calls this, and it is also called by metal_condition_wait; its body must be checked for any calls that could reach producer_thread.\n- metal_mutex_release: producer_thread directly calls this, and it is also called by metal_condition_wait; inspect it for calls back to producer_thread.\n- metal_condition_signal: producer_thread directly calls this; inspect its body for any calls that could create a cycle.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: called by metal_condition_wait; include it because it is part of the transitive call chain initiated by producer_thread.\n\nAnalyzing these symbols (their implementations and their callees) is sufficient given the provided static call graph to determine whether any call path from producer_thread returns to producer_thread (i.e., a direct or indirect recursive cycle)."
