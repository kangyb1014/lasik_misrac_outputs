  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the provided code. The producer_thread function only performs mutex/condition operations and increments an unsigned int counter; metal_condition_wait uses atomics, a syscall (futex) and mutex primitives. There are no calls \u2014 direct or indirect in the shown code fragments \u2014 to string handling functions nor any manipulation of C strings or character buffers that would involve those library routines. Therefore Rule 21.17 (bounds of objects referenced by string.h functions) is not applicable to any fragment shown and no code needs to be flagged for investigation on that basis."
