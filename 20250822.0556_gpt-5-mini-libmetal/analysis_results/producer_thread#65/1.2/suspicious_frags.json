  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. Reasoning:\n- The use of (void)arg is a standard C idiom to silence unused-parameter warnings, not a language extension.\n- uintptr_t is a standard type from <stdint.h> (C99) and its cast usage is standard C.\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub, and atomic_int are C11 stdatomic constructs (standard language/library features, not compiler extensions).\n- syscall(SYS_futex, ...) and the FUTEX_WAIT / SYS_futex macros are OS/system-call APIs (Linux-specific), but they are not compiler language extensions; they are platform APIs and do not violate Rule 1.2 by themselves.\n- METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE(lock), METAL_CONDITION_INIT, and functions such as metal_mutex_acquire/release are macro/function names; macros themselves are not compiler language extensions. Their definitions are not provided here \u2014 if those macro definitions expand to compiler-specific extensions (for example __attribute__, inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions, or other documented compiler extensions), those definitions would need to be inspected. Based on the code shown, there is no evidence of such expansions.\n\nIf you can supply the definitions/expansions of the METAL_* macros and any headers that implement the atomic or mutex APIs, I can re-check those for compiler-specific extensions. As-is, there are no suspicious language-extension usages in the shown fragments."
