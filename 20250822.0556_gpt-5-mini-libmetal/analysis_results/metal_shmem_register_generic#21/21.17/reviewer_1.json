If shmem->name points to a buffer that lacks a terminating '\\0' (e.g. populated from raw/truncated data or an object without a guaranteed terminator), strlen(shmem->name) may read past the object\u2019s bounds, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. strlen() scans until a '\\0' and can read past the object\u2019s allocated bounds if the character array is not NUL-terminated. The code only checks shmem->name is non-NULL before calling strlen(shmem->name); it does not establish that the pointed-to object is NUL-terminated or that a bound exists to constrain the scan. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 this use is unsafe unless there is a proven invariant (outside this snippet) that shmem->name always points to a NUL-terminated buffer. As shown, the call may result in accesses beyond the object\u2019s bounds, so the reported violation is valid. Suggested remedies: ensure the name is NUL-terminated at initialization, use a bounded length field or use a bounded helper (e.g. strnlen with the known maximum) or otherwise prove the termination invariant to the code reviewer."
