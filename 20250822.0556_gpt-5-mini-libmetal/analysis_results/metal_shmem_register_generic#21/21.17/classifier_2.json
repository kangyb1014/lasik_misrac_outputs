  "scenario": "Calling strlen(shmem->name) can read past the bounds of the object pointed to by shmem->name if that character buffer is not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated. For example, if name points to a 4-byte buffer filled with {'a','b','c','d'} (no '\\0'), or if name points to the middle of a non-terminated region, strlen will scan beyond the allocated object and cause an out-of-bounds access. (Note: the short-circuit in shmem->name && ... prevents a NULL dereference, but it does not ensure a terminating NUL within the object.)"
