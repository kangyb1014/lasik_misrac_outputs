  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The full struct definition is required to see the exact types of all pointer members (especially name, io, node). MISRA analysis depends on whether members are declared as pointers to const-qualified types.\n\n- shmem->name (member type): Critical to know whether name is declared as char * or const char * (or other). Passing name to strlen and using it elsewhere determines if it could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct metal_io (or the type of shmem->io): The io member\u2019s type must be known to inspect its nested ops field and to determine the types of pointers inside (affects whether those pointers could be const-qualified).\n\n- struct metal_io_ops (or the type of shmem->io.ops): The ops structure holds the close member. We need its definition to see the exact type of close (function-pointer type) and whether it could/should point to const-qualified targets.\n\n- ops.close (type / prototype): The exact function-pointer signature is required to judge whether the pointer-to-function type should/should not be const-qualified under MISRA rules.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (prototype): The parameter types of this function determine whether &shmem->node and &_metal.common.generic_shmem_list are being passed to non-const or const parameters; this affects whether the addresses (pointers) should point to const-qualified types.\n\n- struct metal_list (type of generic_shmem_list): Definition needed to check whether generic_shmem_list\u2019s declaration uses const qualifiers and whether its element type would force node\u2019s type to be const or not.\n\n- struct metal_node (type of shmem->node): The node member\u2019s type is passed by address; we must know its type to see whether it could/should be a pointer to const-qualified data.\n\n- _metal (global) and struct metal_common (type of _metal.common): To know the type of generic_shmem_list (member of _metal.common) and whether that global\u2019s declaration uses const qualifiers.\n\n- strlen (prototype): strlen takes const char *; knowing its prototype clarifies that passing name to strlen is compatible with a const-qualified char *, and helps determine if name ought to be const.\n\n- metal_assert (macro or function): The assertion usage inspects name and length; the macro\u2019s expansion could reference or modify its argument or have type implications. Its definition is needed to ensure it does not change constness assumptions.\n\nThese symbols together allow an analyzer to determine the precise pointer types used in the function, and whether any of those pointers could or should be declared with const qualification per the MISRA rule."
