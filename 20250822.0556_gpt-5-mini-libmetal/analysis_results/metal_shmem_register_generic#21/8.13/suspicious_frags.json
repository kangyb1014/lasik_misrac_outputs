  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the function do not need investigation under Rule 8.13: the member 'name' is already declared as const char * in struct metal_generic_shmem, and strlen accepts a const char * (so no missing const there). The check of shmem->io.ops.close only reads a function pointer (no modification). The call metal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, &shmem->node) operates on the node member and is expected to modify list/node linkage; therefore the node and enclosing object must be mutable and cannot (practically) be const-qualified. Consequently, no other pointer expressions in the provided code require further investigation for missing const qualification."
