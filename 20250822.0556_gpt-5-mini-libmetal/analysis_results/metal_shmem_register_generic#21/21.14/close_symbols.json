  "explanation": "strlen \u2014 The target calls strlen(shmem->name). To decide whether a string is being handled as a NUL-terminated C string (and therefore whether using memcmp would be a violation), the definition/semantics of strlen must be visible.\n\nmetal_assert \u2014 metal_assert is used in the function and may be a macro or function that expands to code which could call other functions (including memcmp) or perform string comparisons; its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nmetal_list_add_tail \u2014 This function is called by the target. It must be examined to ensure it (or functions it calls) do not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings; any indirect use of memcmp within the callee would be relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\nstruct metal_generic_shmem (definition) \u2014 The layout and types of members (in particular the type of name) are needed to confirm that shmem->name is a NUL-terminated string (char * or char[]) so that any memcmp usages would fall under the MISRA prohibition.\n\nstruct metal_io_ops / io.ops.close (definition) \u2014 The code asserts !shmem->io.ops.close. Inspecting the types confirms this is a function pointer and not some string or other object that could be compared; also ensures no hidden string comparisons occur via this member access.\n\n_metal and _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (definition) \u2014 The list object passed to metal_list_add_tail should be typed (struct metal_list or similar). Its definition is needed to inspect whether list manipulation code compares strings using memcmp.\n\nmemcmp \u2014 The standard-library memcmp symbol should be considered so the analyzer can see whether any of the inspected symbols (macros, callees, or data structure helpers) call memcmp. Presence/usages of memcmp are what the MISRA rule prohibits when applied to NUL-terminated strings."
