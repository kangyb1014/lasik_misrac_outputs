  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, while, for, do-while, switch) are present in metal_shmem_register_generic. The only expressions are function/macro calls (metal_assert(...), metal_list_add_tail(...)) and a return statement. The metal_assert macro is a simple alias to metal_sys_assert(cond) per the provided definition, not a loop with an invariant controlling expression; even if an assert macro used a do { ... } while (0) pattern, that pattern is an allowed exception (a do-while with an essentially Boolean constant false controlling expression). Therefore there are no invariant controlling expressions requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
