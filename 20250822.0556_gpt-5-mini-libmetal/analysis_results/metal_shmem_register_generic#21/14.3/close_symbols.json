  "explanation": "metal_assert: The two conditional expressions appear only inside metal_assert(...) calls. Whether those produce an actual controlling expression (e.g. an if) or are removed/altered depends on the macro expansion. You must inspect the macro implementation to see if it generates a runtime conditional (subject to MISRA's rule) or expands to nothing/compile-time code.\n\nNDEBUG: Commonly controls removal/behavior of assert-like macros. If NDEBUG (or another compile-time flag used by metal_assert) disables the macro expansion so no controlling expression remains, there is no MISRA violation. Confirming the presence/value of NDEBUG (or equivalent) is required.\n\nstruct metal_generic_shmem: The assertions test shmem->name and shmem->io.ops.close. You need the struct definition to confirm the types of these members (e.g. whether name is a pointer, a compile-time constant, or otherwise invariant) and to confirm that these members are ordinary runtime fields rather than macros or constants.\n\nstruct/type of shmem->io and io.ops.close (e.g. struct metal_io_ops): The second assert checks !shmem->io.ops.close. You must know the type of io.ops.close (function pointer, integer, macro) to determine whether that test is a runtime-varying expression or an invariant (for example if close is defined as a compile-time constant or removed by preprocessing).\n\nstrlen: The first assert uses strlen(shmem->name) != 0. You should confirm strlen's declaration/implementation (or any macro replacement) to ensure it is a normal library/runtime call that depends on shmem->name rather than a compile-time constant, and that it has no surprising side-effects that affect whether the controlling expression is invariant."
