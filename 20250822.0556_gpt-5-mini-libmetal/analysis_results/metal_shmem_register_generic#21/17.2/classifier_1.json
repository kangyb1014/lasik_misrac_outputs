  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No evidence of direct or indirect recursion: the function metal_shmem_register_generic calls metal_list_add_tail to insert a node into a list. There is no call to metal_shmem_register_generic from within itself, nor any shown call chain where metal_list_add_tail would call back into metal_shmem_register_generic. Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated. (Only a violation would occur if metal_list_add_tail or any function it invokes were implemented to call back into metal_shmem_register_generic, which is not indicated by the provided code.)"
