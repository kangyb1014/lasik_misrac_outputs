  "explanation": "The function body contains only a few statements. The three fragments above are the only places where other functions or function-like entities are referenced and thus are the only places that could participate in direct or indirect recursion and warrant investigation. There are no other function calls or function-pointer invocations in this function (the remaining statements are comments and the final return 0;), so no additional fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2."
