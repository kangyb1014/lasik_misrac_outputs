  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls metal_assert and strlen; neither function calls metal_shmem_register_generic, so there is no direct or indirect recursion. A violation would occur only if metal_assert (or strlen) were implemented such that it directly or transitively invoked metal_shmem_register_generic (i.e., if the assertion handling or any called function called back into metal_shmem_register_generic), creating recursion."
