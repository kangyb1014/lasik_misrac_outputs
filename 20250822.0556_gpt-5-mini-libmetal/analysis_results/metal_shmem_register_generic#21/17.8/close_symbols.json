  "explanation": "- struct metal_generic_shmem: needed to see the exact member types/names (name, io, node). To determine whether &shmem->node is an allowed modification of the object pointed to (allowed) and to ensure there is no hidden indirection that could modify the pointer parameter itself.\n- metal_assert: could be a macro or function that evaluates its argument with side effects (multiple evaluation or assignments). Inspecting its definition verifies it does not assign to or otherwise modify the shmem parameter.\n- strlen: verify its prototype (takes const char *) and does not modify the pointer or pointed-to data; ensures calling strlen(shmem->name) does not violate the rule.\n- metal_list_add_tail: needed to examine its prototype/implementation to ensure it does not take a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise assign to the shmem parameter; confirm it only modifies the list node (shmem->node) and the list head, not the shmem pointer itself.\n- struct metal_list: the type of shmem->node; required to know what metal_list_add_tail will modify (members of the node), so we can reason that only the pointed-to object is changed (allowed) and not the pointer parameter.\n- struct metal_io (and its ops/close member): to confirm the type of io.ops.close and that testing !shmem->io.ops.close is a read-only check (no modification of the shmem pointer).\n- _metal (the common.generic_shmem_list object and its type): to see the list head type passed to metal_list_add_tail and to confirm no indirection from the list head could result in modifying the pointer parameter.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst confirm whether any of the called macros/functions or data-member accesses assign to or rebind the parameter 'shmem' (which would violate the MISRA rule) versus only mutating the object pointed to (which is allowed)."
