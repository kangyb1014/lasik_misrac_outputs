Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "MISRA rule about well-formed for-loops requires examining the behaviour of any functions called from the target function (their bodies count as part of the loop behaviour). The target function directly calls or uses the following symbols, so their definitions/implementations are required to determine if any for-loops involved would violate the rule:\n\n- metal_assert: Called (likely a macro). Its expansion or implementation may contain statements or calls (including for-loops) that must be checked.\n- strlen: Called on shmem->name. The implementation of strlen typically contains a loop; its body must be inspected to ensure it is a well-formed for-loop per MISRA rules.\n- metal_list_add_tail: Direct callee. Its implementation manipulates list structures and may contain loops; those loops must be checked.\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The target accesses shmem->name, shmem->io.ops.close, and shmem->node. The struct definition is needed to confirm types, and to see whether accessing these fields has any side-effects or hidden macros.\n- struct metal_io_ops (type of shmem->io.ops): The code asserts on ops.close; the type definition is needed to confirm that reading this member has no side effects and to examine any inline implementations tied to it.\n- _metal (global) and the type of _metal.common (in particular generic_shmem_list): The global list head passed into metal_list_add_tail could affect how the list function behaves; the object's type and any associated inline functions/macros must be inspected for loops.\n- struct metal_list_node / list head type: metal_list_add_tail will operate on node fields (shmem->node); the node/list type definition is needed to understand how the list code iterates or modifies nodes.\n- container_of (or any macros used by metal_list_add_tail): Common list implementations use macros (container_of, list_for_each, etc.). Those macros expand into code (possibly loops) and must be examined.\n\nProviding these symbols (function implementations, struct/type definitions, and relevant macros) allows a complete check for any for-loops in the code paths exercised by metal_shmem_register_generic, so the MISRA C for-loop well-formedness rule can be evaluated accurately."
