  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, inline helpers and types referenced by the source line-level code. Specifically:\n\n- metal_assert: usually a macro; its expansion may use GCC/clang extensions (statement expressions ({...}), __builtin_*, typeof, asm, attributes, variadic macro extensions, or compiler-specific diagnostics). You must see its definition.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: may be a macro or inline function that implements generic list operations. Common implementations use container_of, typeof, statement expressions or other extensions. Its definition is required.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: the structure definition is needed to check for anonymous structs/unions, bit-fields, compiler-specific attributes on members, or use of language-extension features in member declarations (e.g., unnamed bit-field width using expressions, flexible array members with extensions, etc.).\n\n- _metal (global) and its type: the expression _metal.common.generic_shmem_list accesses a global object and a member; the type definition might use anonymous structs/unions or compiler extensions. You must inspect the definition of the global and its type.\n\n- type of _metal.common.generic_shmem_list: the list object type (likely struct metal_list) and its definition are needed because list helper macros/functions frequently use non-standard extensions (container_of, typeof, statement-expression) or attributes.\n\n- shmem->node member type: the node passed to metal_list_add_tail may be of a type whose definition contains extensions; inspect it to detect extension use.\n\n- shmem->name member type: although likely a char*, its declaration could involve compiler-specific qualifiers or macros; inspect to ensure no extension is used (and to confirm strlen usage is ordinary).\n\n- shmem->io and its ops (struct metal_io, struct metal_io_ops) and the close member: the code asserts on !shmem->io.ops.close; those nested members might be declared using anonymous structs/unions or extension attributes \u2014 their definitions are needed.\n\n- strlen: normally a standard C library function, but some toolchains expose it as a builtin or macro. To be certain no compiler-specific builtin/macro extension is used, inspect the included declaration (string.h / headers) or compiler builtins.\n\nOnly by examining the above macro definitions and type declarations can you reliably determine whether any language/compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, attributes, inline asm, anonymous struct/union extensions, builtin intrinsics, etc.) are being used in the target function."
