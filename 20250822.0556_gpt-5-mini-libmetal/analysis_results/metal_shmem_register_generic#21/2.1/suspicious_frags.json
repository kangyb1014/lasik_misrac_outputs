  "explanation": "No other code fragments in the provided function or related macro definition need investigation for unreachable code. The function body consists only of the two assert calls, a single list insertion call, and a final return; there are no conditional blocks, loops, labels, gotos, or subsequent statements that could be statically identified as unreachable beyond the listed fragments. The listed items are the only points where control flow could be affected in a way that would make subsequent code not execute, so all other parts do not require further scrutiny for Rule 2.1."
