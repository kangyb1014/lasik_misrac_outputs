  "explanation": "_metal (definition): needed to see the exact type of num_page_sizes and the page_sizes array so we can determine how path is stored (array vs pointer) and whether any assignment here conflicts with const-qualification.\n\npage_sizes element type (definition): the element struct declaration reveals all member types (page_shift, page_size, mmap_flags and crucially path). Knowing the element type is required to decide if the path member could or should be declared const (or if it already is).\n\npage_sizes[].path member (declaration/type): this is the single most important symbol for the MISRA pointer-const rule \u2014 we must know whether path is declared as char[], char*, or const char*; writing into a const char* would be a violation, whereas copying into a mutable char buffer is acceptable.\n\nstrncpy (prototype): required to confirm the parameter types (destination is char* and source is const char*) and ensure the call itself does not attempt to write through a const-qualified destination or otherwise contradict const qualification.\n\nPATH_MAX (macro): needed to know the size argument passed to strncpy (type and value) and to confirm the destination buffer layout (if path is an array sized by PATH_MAX) \u2014 this helps determine whether the path member is an array (mutable) or a pointer, which affects const qualification."
