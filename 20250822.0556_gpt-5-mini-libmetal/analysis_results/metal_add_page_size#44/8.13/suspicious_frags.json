  "explanation": "All other lines in the function do not introduce pointer objects that could/should be const-qualified (they are integer variables, integer assignments, or logging/error returns). The only pointer-related elements are the function parameter 'path' (which is already declared const) and uses of that parameter: the call to strncpy (source 'path' and destination _metal.page_sizes[index].path) and the call to metal_log that passes 'path' as an argument. These fragments are listed because they require checking: the actual type of _metal.page_sizes[].path (whether it is a mutable buffer or a non-const pointer) and the prototype of metal_log (whether it accepts const-qualified pointers or would discard const) could affect compliance with Rule 8.13. No other fragments in this snippet involve pointers that could be made const, so they do not need further investigation."
