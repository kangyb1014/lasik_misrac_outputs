  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related definitions for any use of memcmp (direct calls, macros expanding to memcmp, or obvious wrappers). No occurrences of memcmp are present. The only string-handling call is strncpy, which copies rather than compares and therefore is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The metal_log calls use printf-style formatting and do not imply any memcmp usage. Based on the given code, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
