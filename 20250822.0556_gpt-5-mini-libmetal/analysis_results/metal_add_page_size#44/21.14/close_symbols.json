  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule about memcmp and NUL-terminated strings:\n\n- strncpy: This function is used to copy the incoming path into _metal.page_sizes[index].path. strncpy can truncate and may not NUL-terminate the destination if source length >= destination size. To decide whether subsequent comparisons would be comparing NUL-terminated strings (and therefore whether memcmp would be misused), you must know exactly how strncpy is used and whether it guarantees termination in this context.\n\n- PATH_MAX: The destination length passed to strncpy is PATH_MAX. The actual value of PATH_MAX determines whether truncation can occur and whether a NUL terminator can be guaranteed when copying paths of typical/possible lengths.\n\n- _metal (definition, including page_sizes array and the path member and its size/type): You need the definition of the _metal global to know the actual buffer that is written (the address, declared size, and type). In particular, whether page_sizes[].path is an array of char of size PATH_MAX (or something else) is critical to reasoning about NUL-termination and whether strings stored here are NUL-terminated C strings.\n\n- struct type of _metal.page_sizes[] (fields: page_shift, page_size, mmap_flags, path): The concrete element type used in _metal.page_sizes gives the exact declaration of the path member (array vs pointer, size), which affects whether strncpy will create a NUL-terminated string and whether that memory is intended to hold NUL-terminated strings to be compared.\n\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES: The code checks index >= MAX_PAGE_SIZES; knowing the value and meaning of MAX_PAGE_SIZES is necessary to ensure there is no out-of-bounds write that could affect string storage and later comparisons (indirectly relevant to correctness of string handling and potential misuses of memcmp).\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. Even though this function does not call memcmp directly, you must check whether memcmp is (or could be) used elsewhere on the buffers this function writes. Including memcmp as a symbol lets the analyzer search for uses that would make the strncpy behavior here relevant to the MISRA rule (i.e., whether memcmp is being used to compare these paths as NUL-terminated strings)."
