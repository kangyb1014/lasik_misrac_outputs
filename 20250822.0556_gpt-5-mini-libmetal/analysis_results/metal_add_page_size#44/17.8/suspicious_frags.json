  "explanation": "No code fragments modify any function parameter or the pointer parameter itself. Specific checks:\n- 'path' is used read-only (passed to strncpy and metal_log) and never assigned to or incremented; the code copies from 'path' into _metal.page_sizes[index].path, which modifies the object pointed to by the destination, not the pointer parameter. Modifying the object referenced by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; only changing the pointer variable is disallowed.\n- 'shift' and 'mmap_flags' are only read and assigned to structure members; neither parameter is assigned to or altered.\n- There are no statements like path = ..., path++, shift = ..., or any other modification of the parameter identifiers.\nTherefore, no fragments require investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
