  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. There are only two if-statements (if (index >= MAX_PAGE_SIZES) and if (!path || shift <= 0)), both depend on variables (_metal.num_page_sizes via index, path, and shift) so they are not constant/invariant. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions. The use of the macro MAX_PAGE_SIZES is a constant but it is compared against the variable index, so the controlling expression is not invariant. Therefore no code fragments in this function require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
