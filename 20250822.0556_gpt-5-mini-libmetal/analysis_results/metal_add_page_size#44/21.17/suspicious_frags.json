  "explanation": "Only the use of strncpy is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so it must be investigated. No other calls to the <string.h> functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The remaining code does not perform string-library operations: index bounds for _metal.page_sizes are checked by the MAX_PAGE_SIZES test, the path pointer is checked for NULL before use (so no immediate NULL pointer passed to string functions), assignments to numeric fields and the log calls do not invoke <string.h> functions. Therefore no other fragments in this function need to be investigated under Rule 21.17."
