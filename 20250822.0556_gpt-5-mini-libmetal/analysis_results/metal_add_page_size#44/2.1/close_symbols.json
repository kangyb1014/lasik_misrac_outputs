  "explanation": "Explain why each is required for determining unreachable code in metal_add_page_size:\n\n- _metal: The function\u2019s control flow depends on _metal.num_page_sizes (index) and it writes into _metal.page_sizes[]. You must inspect the definition, initial value and all sites that modify these fields to determine whether the \"index >= MAX_PAGE_SIZES\" branch or subsequent indexing can ever occur (or be unreachable).\n\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES: The comparison against index (num_page_sizes) uses this macro. Its value determines whether the overflow branch (return -EOVERFLOW) is ever reachable.\n\n- PATH_MAX: Used as the length argument to strncpy. While not directly a control-flow predicate, you need its definition to check whether strncpy usage or its compile-time form could affect reachability or be optimized away; also to confirm the indexing/assignment into page_sizes.path is meaningful.\n\n- metal_init_page_sizes: This function is the direct caller of metal_add_page_size (per the call graph). You must inspect its calls to metal_add_page_size to see what argument values (path, shift, mmap_flags) and what _metal state it supplies so you can determine if the early-return branches (invalid args, overflow) can ever be taken.\n\n- metal_sys_init: metal_init_page_sizes is called by metal_sys_init (per the call graph). To determine whether metal_add_page_size (and therefore parts of its body) are reachable at all in the project you must follow the caller chain and confirm that metal_sys_init (and its callers) are reachable/executed.\n\n- metal_log: Logging calls appear in each branch. metal_log could be a macro or function that has side effects (e.g. longjmp/abort) that alter control flow; inspect its implementation to ensure those calls do not make subsequent code unreachable or change the semantics of returns.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING / METAL_LOG_DEBUG: These logging-level macros/constants are used in calls to metal_log. If they are defined in a way that affects macro expansion of metal_log (e.g. compile-time guards), they could affect whether logging statements (and therefore code around them) are present/compiled, which matters for reachability analysis.\n\n- strncpy: The call appears in the function. Although normally a library function, strncpy could be macro-wrapped or replaced in this project; you must confirm it does not contain control-flow affecting behavior (e.g. non-returning wrappers) and that the copy does not cause undefined behaviour that would render later statements unreachable.\n\nNote: The list focuses on symbols that can change whether branches or the whole function body are actually reachable. Other symbols such as EOVERFLOW/EINVAL or the type definitions of page_sizes members are less likely to affect reachability, but can be added if deeper semantic checking is required."
