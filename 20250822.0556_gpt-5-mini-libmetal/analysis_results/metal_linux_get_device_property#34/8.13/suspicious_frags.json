  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: property_name is already const-qualified (const char *), so it satisfies the rule; output is passed to read() and is used as a writeable destination, so it cannot be const; flags and mode are integer constants (not pointer types) so the rule does not apply; path is a local array (char path[PATH_MAX]) rather than a pointer type; file-descriptor variables and return-value handling involve integer types, not pointers. Therefore the only locations that may violate the requirement that pointers should point to const-qualified types are the function parameter and local pointer assignments shown above."
