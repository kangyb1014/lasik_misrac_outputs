Since the pointer could point to a const-qualified type, it should be declared as 'const struct linux_device *ldev' to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In metal_linux_get_device_property the local pointer ldev is only used to read data (accessing ldev->sdev->path for snprintf) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible in such cases. Declaring the variable as const struct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device); would satisfy the rule (assigning a non-const pointer to a const-qualified pointer is allowed). Therefore the agent A's finding is valid."
