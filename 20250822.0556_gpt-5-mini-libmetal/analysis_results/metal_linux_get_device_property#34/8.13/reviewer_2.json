If sdev->path is declared as a non-const char * (e.g. char *path;) then this is a violation: the pointer should be declared as const char * since it is only used for reading (snprintf does not modify the source string). Note: property_name is already const char * (OK) and the local path array is a destination buffer (not subject to 8.13).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 expects pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In the snippet shown, ldev->sdev->path is only read (used as an argument to snprintf with \"%s\") so, if the struct member sdev->path is actually declared as a non-const char * and it is never modified anywhere, then that declaration would be non-conforming with 8.13 and Agent A\u2019s reasoning would be correct. However, the code fragment does not include the declaration of sdev->path (or uses of it elsewhere), so you cannot determine from this snippet alone whether the member is declared non-const or whether it is modified elsewhere. Therefore the reported violation cannot be confirmed from the provided code. If the real declaration is non-const and the object is never modified, it should be changed to const char * to satisfy Rule 8.13."
