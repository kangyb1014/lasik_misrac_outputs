  "explanation": "to_linux_device: needed to check whether that function modifies the incoming parameter 'device' (e.g. by assigning to it or otherwise having side-effects on the caller's parameter variable). If to_linux_device wrote to or re-assigned its parameter this would violate the MISRA rule for the caller if that happened via a reference/pointer mechanism.\n\nstruct metal_device: the exact declaration of the parameter type 'struct metal_device *device' is required to verify whether there are any unusual semantics (macros, annotations, or typedefs) that could change how the parameter is passed or mutated.\n\nstruct linux_device: the returned type from to_linux_device is dereferenced in the target function (ldev). Its definition is required to understand the ldev->sdev access and to ensure no hidden side-effects or overloaded macros are involved that could modify the 'device' parameter variable.\n\nlinux_device::sdev and sdev::path: the code uses ldev->sdev->path in snprintf. The definition/type of the sdev member and its path member are needed to ensure these are plain data accesses (not macros or accessor functions that could mutate the original 'device' parameter) and to confirm the path value is only read.\n\nsnprintf, open, read, close: the declarations/definitions (or confirmation they are the standard library/syscalls) are needed to ensure that passing property_name and output to these functions cannot modify the pointer variables themselves. While these functions may write to the objects pointed to (allowed by MISRA), they must not reassign the pointer parameters in the caller. Including them rules out nonstandard macros or wrappers that might alter caller parameters.\n\n(These symbols are sufficient for deciding whether the target function or any directly called symbol modifies its parameter variables. No other callees appear in the static call graph, so other symbols are not required for this specific MISRA rule check.)"
