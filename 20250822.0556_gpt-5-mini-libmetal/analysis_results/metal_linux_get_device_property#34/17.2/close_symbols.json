  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check for recursion (MISRA rule):\n\n- to_linux_device\n  - The target function directly calls to_linux_device. You must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call back (directly or indirectly) into metal_linux_get_device_property or into other functions that eventually call metal_linux_get_device_property. Any such path would create indirect recursion.\n\n- metal_linux_dev_close, metal_linux_dev_irq_ack, metal_linux_dev_dma_map, metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap\n  - These functions are listed in the static call graph as callers of to_linux_device. Although they are not direct callees of the target, they are part of the surrounding call graph that involves to_linux_device. Inspecting their definitions is necessary if to_linux_device forwards control to helpers, uses callbacks, or if the static graph is incomplete: they could participate in an indirect cycle back to metal_linux_get_device_property. Verifying these functions ensures no alternate path exists that forms recursion through shared helpers or callback chains.\n\nNote: Standard library/syscall functions used in the target (snprintf, open, read, close) do not need to be inspected for recursion because they cannot call back into program-defined functions in this context; only the project-defined symbols above are required to determine whether metal_linux_get_device_property is involved in a direct or indirect self-call."
