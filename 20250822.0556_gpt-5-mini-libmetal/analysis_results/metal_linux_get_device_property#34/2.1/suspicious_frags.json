  "explanation": "No unreachable code found. Every statement in the function can be reached under some runtime condition: the open() failure branch (if fd < 0) returns; the read() failure branch (if read() < 0) closes fd and returns; and the normal-success path executes close(fd) and the final return. There are no statements following an unconditional return, no unused code blocks, no unreachable labels or dead branches that cannot be exercised for any possible input or runtime condition. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
