Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to analyze MISRA rule for 'for' loops:\n\n- to_linux_device (function definition): The target calls this function. MISRA's for-loop rule requires considering the behaviour of any functions called within a for-loop body; conversely, to be sure there are no hidden loops or side effects relevant to loop counters in the call chain, you must inspect the implementation of to_linux_device for any for-loops or side effects it may introduce.\n\n- struct linux_device (type definition): The target indexes fields of a linux_device (ldev->sdev->path). Knowing the actual type and whether any members are implemented via inline functions, macros, or have side effects is necessary to rule out hidden control flow (e.g., macros expanding to loops) or modifications to objects that could serve as loop counters.\n\n- struct metal_device (type definition): to_linux_device converts the metal_device to linux_device; the metal_device definition is needed to understand that conversion, and to check if any conversions/macros could introduce loops or modify objects used as loop counters.\n\n- type/definition of ldev->sdev and its struct (sdev type and definition): The code accesses sdev->path. If sdev (or its path member) is implemented via macros, accessor functions, or has side effects, those could contain loops or modify objects. You must inspect this struct to exclude such cases.\n\n- snprintf (declaration / implementation if available): snprintf is invoked in the target. If you require absolute certainty about any loops or side effects inside functions called from the target (per MISRA semantics about called-function behaviour), you need snprintf's implementation. At minimum its declaration confirms it is a library call; if you must inspect for non-compliant for-loops inside its body, you need its source/implementation.\n\n- open, read, close (declarations / implementations if available): Same reason as snprintf \u2014 they are called from the target. To fully apply MISRA's rule that function-call behaviour within loop bodies be considered, you may need their implementations to ensure they don't contain for-loops that interact with loop counters used in the target (or hidden modifications). If you accept standard library/system calls as externally trusted, their declarations suffice.\n\n- PATH_MAX (macro / constant): The size of the local buffer 'path' depends on PATH_MAX. While not directly related to for-loop formation, knowing PATH_MAX helps reason about buffer sizing and whether any macros used might expand to code with loops; include it to fully understand macros/constants used in expressions in the function.\n\n- errno (declaration / semantics): errno is read to produce return values. Although not directly a loop concern, understanding whether errno is a macro or function-like (platform-specific) is needed to ensure reading it does not invoke functions or side effects that could modify loop counters.\n\n- O_RDONLY, S_IRUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IROTH (macros/constants): These macros are used in calls to open. Verify they are simple constants (no side effects or macro expansions that introduce control flow). If any were defined as function-like macros (unlikely), they could contain loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\nNotes / scope guidance:\n- The only direct callee in the static call graph is to_linux_device; therefore it is the primary symbol to inspect for for-loops or side effects. The standard library/system calls (snprintf/open/read/close) are usually treated as trusted external code; include their implementations only if your MISRA analysis policy requires inspecting called-library code for for-loop compliance. The struct/type definitions are included to detect any accessor macros/inline functions that could hide loops or modify potential loop-control objects."
