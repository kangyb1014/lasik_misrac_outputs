  "explanation": "to_linux_device: Must be inspected to ensure it does not itself call memcmp (or any wrapper that uses memcmp) to compare null-terminated strings. The static call graph shows this function is the only project-level callee, so it is the primary candidate for hidden memcmp usage.\n\nstruct linux_device (including member sdev): The target builds a path using ldev->sdev->path. You need the definition to know the type, lifetime and null-termination guarantees of that member (e.g. whether path is a NUL-terminated C string). If path is not NUL-terminated or has different semantics, callers might (or other functions might) use memcmp incorrectly.\n\nsdev->path (type and null-termination semantics): Explicitly inspect the path member to confirm it is a null-terminated string; this affects whether any memcmp usages (in to_linux_device or elsewhere) would be comparing null-terminated strings (the subject of the MISRA rule).\n\nsnprintf: The code uses snprintf to compose the path. Verify its behaviour (null-termination, truncation rules) in this context to determine whether the resulting buffer is guaranteed NUL-terminated; a non-terminated buffer could lead to incorrect string handling elsewhere and could motivate misuse of memcmp.\n\nPATH_MAX: The size of the path buffer and the snprintf call depends on PATH_MAX. You need the macro to reason about buffer size vs. formatted string length and therefore whether the buffer will be NUL-terminated.\n\nopen, read, close: While standard system calls do not use memcmp for string comparisons, include their declarations to confirm no project-specific wrappers (or macros) replace them with implementations that might call memcmp incorrectly. Also they confirm the control flow (the function returns after read/open failures) so no further in-function memcmp usage is present.\n\nNote: The target function itself does not call memcmp. The above symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether any called/project-level helper (particularly to_linux_device) or the way path is formed could involve memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings, which would be a MISRA C violation."
