  "explanation": "I examined the function for calls to the Standard Library string functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). There are no uses of any <string.h> functions in this code fragment. The code uses snprintf (from <stdio.h>) and the system calls open/read/close; while these could have their own safety considerations (e.g., snprintf truncation with PATH_MAX, or ensuring the provided len matches the actual buffer size for read), they are not subject to Rule 21.17 which specifically targets functions from <string.h>. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for investigation under Rule 21.17."
