  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about out-of-bounds accesses by string-handling functions you need symbols that let you reason about buffer capacities, the actual string sources, and any intermediate code that might use string.h routines:\n\n- PATH_MAX: the stack buffer path is declared as char path[PATH_MAX]; you must know the numerical value of PATH_MAX to determine the capacity of path and whether the formatted string could exceed it.\n\n- struct linux_device (full definition): the code uses to_linux_device(device) returned as struct linux_device *ldev; you must see the layout to understand members accessed here and any hidden buffers.\n\n- type/definition of ldev->sdev and its 'path' member (full definition of the sdev struct): snprintf uses ldev->sdev->path as one of the input strings. You need to know whether path is a fixed-size array (and its size) or a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer, and any documented maximum length, to compute the worst-case combined length passed to snprintf.\n\n- to_linux_device (function definition): although it appears to be a simple conversion, its implementation could perform copying or other string operations (possibly using string.h functions) or return an unexpected pointer. Inspecting it ensures no hidden string.h calls or modifications that affect safety.\n\n- snprintf (declaration / standard semantics): while not in <string.h>, snprintf is the formatting function that writes into the path buffer. To reason about overflows you must rely on the standard semantics (how many characters it writes, truncation, null-termination guarantees, and return value behavior) so you can determine whether truncation prevents out-of-bounds writes in all cases.\n\n- callers/definitions that produce property_name (call sites or constraints on property_name): property_name is a parameter and could be arbitrarily long; to determine whether combining ldev->sdev->path, the literal \"/of_node/\", and property_name can exceed path capacity you need to know any length guarantees or maximums imposed by callers (or lack thereof). If callers guarantee a maximum length, concatenation may be safe; otherwise you must assume unbounded length.\n\nNote: The target function itself does not call functions from <string.h> directly, but to be confident the MISRA rule is not violated you must inspect the above symbols to (1) confirm no string.h calls occur in to_linux_device or in the definitions of the source strings, and (2) compute worst-case lengths to ensure snprintf cannot cause an out-of-bounds write into path."
