  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The string operations present are snprintf (from <stdio.h>) and strtoul (from <stdlib.h>), which are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The snprintf use includes a truncation check (result >= sizeof(path)) so the local buffer construction does not present an obvious <string.h> bounds violation. The only other string data access is attr->value passed to strtoul; strtoul is not a <string.h> function. Note: implementations of sysfs_open_attribute/sysfs_read_attribute/sysfs_close_attribute (and the type/contents of attr->value) are outside this function \u2014 if those functions use <string.h> APIs internally, they should be inspected separately, but that is beyond the provided code fragment. Therefore no code fragments in the provided function need investigation under Rule 21.17."
