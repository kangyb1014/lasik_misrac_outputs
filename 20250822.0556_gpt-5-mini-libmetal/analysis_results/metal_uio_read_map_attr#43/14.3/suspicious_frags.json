  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found in the function. Specifically:\n- The snprintf overflow check (if (result >= (int)sizeof(path))) depends on the runtime return value of snprintf and thus is not invariant.\n- The attribute-open/read check (if (!attr || sysfs_read_attribute(attr) != 0)) depends on the result of sysfs_open_attribute(path) and the runtime result of sysfs_read_attribute(attr), so it is not invariant.\n- There are no for/while/do-while loops or selection statements with constant/compile-time controlling expressions; all controlling expressions depend on runtime values or function calls. Therefore, no code fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3 in this function."
