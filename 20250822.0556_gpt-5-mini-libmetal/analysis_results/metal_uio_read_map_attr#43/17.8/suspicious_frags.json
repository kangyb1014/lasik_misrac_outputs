  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to in this function. Analysis by parameter:\n- ldev (struct linux_device *): only read (ldev->cls_path) and not reassigned. Reading/modifying the object pointed to is allowed by the rule; here only reads occur.\n- index (unsigned int): used but not modified.\n- name (const char *): used but not modified; preserved const correctness.\n- value (unsigned long *): the pointer itself is not reassigned; only the object it points to is written via *value = ..., which the rule explicitly allows. \nAll other assignments (cls, path, attr, result) are to local variables, not parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
