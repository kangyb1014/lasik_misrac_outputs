  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_softirq_set uses a compiler language extension you must inspect the symbols it references and how they are implemented:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: the global instance used in the function. Its declaration (storage class, attributes) could contain compiler-specific attributes or extensions that would make the function depend on language extensions.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: the full struct definition is required to see the types of irq_base and irq_num (e.g. whether they use non\u2011standard bitfields, compiler attributes, or typedefs that are extensions).\n\n- metal_softirq_pending: the array referenced by index. You need its declaration to know element type and storage (e.g. section attributes) which might use extensions.\n\n- declaration/typedef of metal_softirq_pending element type: if elements are of an atomic type (atomic_int, atomic_t, _Atomic int, or a custom atomic type), you must know exactly which type is used. C11 _Atomic and stdatomic types are standard; kernel atomic_t or vendor-provided wrappers or typedefs may rely on compiler builtins or macros that are extensions.\n\n- atomic_store (declaration/definition/macro expansion): the call in the function is the most likely source of a language extension. You must inspect the actual declaration or macro expansion to determine whether it is the standard C11 stdatomic atomic_store or a wrapper that expands to compiler builtins or nonstandard constructs.\n\n- stdatomic header / wrapper that defines atomic_store (if present): if atomic_store comes from <stdatomic.h> then it is standard C11; if it comes from a project header, that header may map atomic_store to compiler builtins \u2014 you need that header to decide.\n\n- __atomic_store_n and other compiler atomic builtins (e.g. __sync_*): include these possible builtin symbols to check for in the atomic_store implementation. These builtins are compiler-specific extensions; if atomic_store expands to them the code uses language extensions and must be reported.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the globals, their types, and the actual implementation/expansion of atomic_store) lets the next analyzer determine whether only standard C (C11 stdatomic or plain types) is used or whether compiler-specific builtins/attributes/macros (explicit language extensions) are present."
