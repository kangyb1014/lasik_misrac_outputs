  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (memcmp must not be used to compare null\u2011terminated strings) you must inspect not only the target function text but also the definitions/implementations of every symbol it references and their initializers/expansions to ensure none uses memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings. Why each is required:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: this global is referenced; its definition (possibly in another translation unit) might contain code or initializers that call memcmp on strings.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: you need the concrete field types (irq_base, irq_num) to ensure no hidden string handling or conversions are involved and to confirm there are no embedded function pointers or custom operators that could use memcmp.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending: the global array is written to; its declaration/type may reveal custom types or initializers (e.g. an array of structures with string fields) or alternate store helpers that could use memcmp.\n\n- atomic_store: the function/macro called here must be inspected (or its expanded inline/body) because it is the only call site in the target function \u2014 if its implementation uses memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings that would violate the rule.\n\n- atomic element type / atomic API header: the typedef/implementation used for elements of metal_softirq_pending (e.g. atomic_int, atomic_t, or a custom atomic type) and the header providing atomic_store are needed to find the concrete implementation (macro/intrinsic/wrapper) that might contain memcmp.\n\n- initializers / definition locations of the globals (metal_softirq_cntr, metal_softirq_pending): static initializers or constructors in the TU where these globals are defined can contain memcmp usage; these must be examined.\n\n- any functions/macros called/expanded by atomic_store: if atomic_store is a wrapper that calls other functions/macros, those downstream symbols must be checked for memcmp usage.\n\nInspecting these symbols and their definitions/implementations (including headers and any inlined macros) is sufficient to determine whether the target function (or code it directly invokes) uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
