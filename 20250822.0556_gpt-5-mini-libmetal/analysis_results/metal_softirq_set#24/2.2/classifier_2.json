Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_set:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_set(int irq)\n{\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\n\tcntr = &metal_softirq_cntr;\n\n\tif (irq < cntr->irq_base ||\n\t    irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tirq -= cntr->irq_base;\n\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_set:\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\natomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1);\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in normal use: atomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1) sets the pending flag for a softirq. That write affects program behaviour because other code (softirq dispatch/handler) is expected to read the pending array and act on it; removing the store would prevent softirq activation. Therefore the statement is not dead code. (Note: it would only be a violation if the metal_softirq_pending array is never read anywhere in the project \u2014 in that specific case the store has no effect and would constitute dead code.)"
