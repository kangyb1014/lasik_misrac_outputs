The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_set:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_set(int irq)\n{\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\n\tcntr = &metal_softirq_cntr;\n\n\tif (irq < cntr->irq_base ||\n\t    irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tirq -= cntr->irq_base;\n\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_set:\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE fragment registers metal_softirq_set_enable (not metal_softirq_set), so from this fragment the function metal_softirq_set is not referenced. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, \u201cdead code\u201d is code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; unreachable/unused functions are not classified as dead code by the provided notes. Therefore, based on this fragment alone there is no clear Rule 2.2 violation. (Recommendation: scan the whole project for any calls or registrations of metal_softirq_set; if it is executed but has no effect then Rule 2.2 would be violated.)"
