Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_set:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_set(int irq)\n{\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\n\tcntr = &metal_softirq_cntr;\n\n\tif (irq < cntr->irq_base ||\n\t    irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tirq -= cntr->irq_base;\n\tatomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_set:\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (irq < cntr->irq_base ||\n    irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n\treturn;\n}\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the range check and early return prevent an out-of-range index into metal_softirq_pending; removing the if would change behaviour if callers can pass invalid irq values. The code is therefore not dead. (It would become a violation only if it can be proven that irq is always within [cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num) for every call \u2014 e.g. all call sites guarantee a valid irq or the value is statically constrained \u2014 in which case the comparisons/branch would be executed but redundant and thus would constitute dead code.)"
