  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" we must determine whether the if-condition can be a constant (always true or always false) in actual use. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: the controller instance is the source of irq_base and irq_num used in the controlling expression. If this object (or its fields) is const-initialized or never changes, the expression\u2019s variability is affected.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition: fields irq_base, irq_num and their types/qualifiers): the types, signedness, and qualifiers (const/volatile) of irq_base and irq_num affect evaluation (range, overflow of irq_base + irq_num, and whether reads can change asynchronously). Knowing if fields are volatile or atomic determines whether the expression can vary at runtime.\n\n- definitions/initializers/setters that assign or modify metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base and metal_softirq_cntr.irq_num (including ISRs/threads that write them): to know whether those fields can change between calls (or while this function runs). If they are modified at runtime, the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- all call sites of metal_softirq_set and the exact argument expressions passed (caller function names + argument symbols): the condition depends on the parameter irq. If every call site passes a compile-time constant or an invariant expression, irq may be invariant in practice; conversely, variable arguments make the controlling expression variant. Static call-site info is needed to decide this.\n\n- any macros/constants used as arguments at those call sites (e.g. IRQ_* definitions): if callers pass macros/compile-time constants, those definitions must be inspected to determine invariance.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending (declaration and element type/qualifiers): although atomic_store is executed after the if, the type/qualifiers of the pending array elements (e.g. atomic_int vs volatile int) and their declarations help determine whether atomic operations or memory model semantics could affect assumptions about concurrency and field volatility relevant to invariance analysis.\n\n- atomic_store (declaration/definition used in this build): to confirm it has no surprising side-effects that could influence the controlling expression or shared state (and to understand memory-order/atomic semantics relevant to concurrent modification of controller fields).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next agent determine whether the if controlling expression can be proven invariant (compile-time or across all call sites) or is legitimately variable (due to parameter variability, mutable controller fields, or concurrency), and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
