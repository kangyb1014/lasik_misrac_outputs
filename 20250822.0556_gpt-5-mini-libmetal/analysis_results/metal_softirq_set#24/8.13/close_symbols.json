  "explanation": "struct metal_irq_controller (definition) \u2014 needed to see the exact type/qualifiers of the pointed-to object and its members (irq_base, irq_num) to determine whether the local pointer 'cntr' is only used for reads and therefore could/should be a pointer-to-const. metal_softirq_cntr \u2014 the global instance whose address is taken: its declaration (including any const qualification) is required to know whether taking its address or changing the local pointer to point-to-const is legal/meaningful. metal_softirq_pending \u2014 the array being written through atomic_store: its declaration (element type and any qualifiers) is required to know whether the elements can be const-qualified or whether they are already atomic/volatile/non-const and must remain mutable. atomic_store (declaration / prototype) \u2014 the function/macro signature is required to know the exact parameter type (e.g., _Atomic(T)* vs const _Atomic(T)*) because if atomic_store requires a non-const pointer, that prevents qualifying the pointed-to elements as const; this also informs whether the write to metal_softirq_pending is allowed only via a non-const pointer."
