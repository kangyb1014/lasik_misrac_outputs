  "explanation": "Only the pointer variable 'cntr' and its assignment are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the pointer is used only to read members (irq_base, irq_num) and could be const-qualified. Other fragments in the function do not indicate a violation of Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need investigation: the parameter 'int irq' is not a pointer; the bounds checks and arithmetic on 'irq' are ordinary integer operations; the call atomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1) writes to an atomic object, so the pointed-to object must be modifiable (non-const) and thus is not a candidate for const-qualification; the return statement and simple comparisons are not pointer-related. The macro METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE shown in the additional code instantiates the controller object but does not by itself imply a pointer-qualification issue within this function; the only pointer usage here is 'cntr', which is why only its declaration and the assignment of &metal_softirq_cntr are flagged for investigation."
