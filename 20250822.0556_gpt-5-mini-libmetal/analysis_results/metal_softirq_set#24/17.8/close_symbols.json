  "explanation": "metal_softirq_cntr: The function takes the address of this global and assigns it to the local pointer 'cntr'. To reason about whether the parameter 'irq' is being modified (and whether that modification could be an aliasing/indirect modification) you must know the actual declaration of this global (e.g. whether it is a normal object or a macro/inline accessor).\n\nstruct metal_irq_controller: Needed to know the exact types of the fields irq_base and irq_num and whether any of those field types or accessors are unusual (macros, bitfields, or accessor functions) that could affect whether the statement 'irq -= cntr->irq_base' is a plain modification of the parameter or something else.\n\nmetal_softirq_pending: The array is indexed by 'irq' and passed to atomic_store. Its declaration is required to check whether indexing or the element expression could somehow alias or otherwise modify the parameter 'irq' (for example, if the index operator or the array is implemented via macros or overloaded constructs). It also establishes that the function uses the value of irq after it was modified.\n\natomic_store: The prototype or macro definition is required to verify that the call atomic_store(metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1) does not itself modify the parameter 'irq' via side effects (for example, if atomic_store is a macro that re-evaluates or mutates its arguments). Knowing its definition rules out indirect modification of the parameter.\n\ntype of metal_softirq_pending elements (e.g., atomic_t or _Atomic(int)): The element type shows whether atomic_store is operating on an atomic object type and whether the element expression has any unusual semantics. This helps confirm that the only modification to the parameter is the explicit 'irq -= cntr->irq_base' statement and that no other symbol causes hidden modification.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyst determine whether 'irq' (the function parameter) is directly modified within the function (the 'irq -= ...' assignment) or whether any of the referenced globals/macros/functions introduce indirection or side effects that would change the interpretation of that apparent modification with respect to the MISRA rule."
