This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_cntr: the function indexes and range-checks against this global controller. You must see its definition/value to confirm that the range check actually protects accesses into metal_softirq_pending and to ensure no indirect use of string.h occurs via its init/ops.\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition, members irq_base and irq_num): the code uses cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num to bound the index. Their types and semantics (signed/unsigned width, possible side effects) are required to determine correctness of the bounds test and whether any implicit conversions could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n- metal_softirq_pending (declaration, element type and array/allocated size): the code writes to metal_softirq_pending[irq]; you must know whether this is a true array or a pointer, the element type, and the allocated length to determine whether the indexed access can go out of bounds (and whether any string.h routines are called on that object elsewhere).\n- type of metal_softirq_pending elements (e.g. atomic_int or other atomic type): atomic_store's behavior depends on the target type; some atomic implementations are thin wrappers, others may expand to helper functions or builtins that could (in theory) call or map to routines that use string.h functions. Knowing the element type lets you inspect the correct atomic_store prototype and implementation.\n- atomic_store (declaration/definition/expansion and any underlying implementation or macro it maps to): atomic_store is invoked here. To decide whether this target function violates the string.h rule you must inspect atomic_store\u2019s implementation (or compiler builtin/macro it expands to) to ensure it does not call any string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/etc.) that could access beyond object bounds.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst (a) verify index/bounds logic that governs pointer/array accesses performed here, and (b) inspect any called helper (atomic_store) to ensure no hidden use of <string.h> functions occurs."
