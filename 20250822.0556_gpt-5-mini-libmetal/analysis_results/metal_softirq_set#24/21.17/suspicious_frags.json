  "explanation": "No use of <string.h> string-handling functions is present in the provided code. The function metal_softirq_set contains only integer comparisons, an index adjustment, and an atomic_store call \u2014 none are string functions governed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code performs a bounds check (irq < cntr->irq_base || irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) and returns early if out of range, so the subsequent access metal_softirq_pending[irq] is guarded by that check (assuming metal_softirq_pending is sized to correspond to cntr->irq_num). The METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE line is a macro invocation; no string functions or string.h usage are visible in the provided expansion. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that could violate Rule 21.17 and nothing needs investigation with respect to string-handling out-of-bounds accesses."
