  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any function and therefore does not by itself violate Rule 17.2. However, a violation can occur in the surrounding function if dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap is set to point to metal_dma_unmap: then the later call dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap(...) would be an indirect call to the same function (indirect recursion), which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
