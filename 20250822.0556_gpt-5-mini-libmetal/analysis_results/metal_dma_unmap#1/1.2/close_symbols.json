  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about language extensions you must inspect any symbol whose definition could hide use of compiler-specific extensions or nonstandard constructs. Brief reasons: \n\n- struct metal_device: the function accesses dev and dev->bus; the struct definition may contain compiler-specific attributes, bit-fields, anonymous members, or other extensions.\n- type of dev->bus (e.g. struct metal_bus): the bus type might use extensions (attributes, packed, special calling convention annotations) that affect whether the source uses language/compiler extensions.\n- type of dev->bus->ops (e.g. struct metal_bus_ops): the ops structure definition may include extension usage (GCC attributes on members, unusual types, anonymous unions/structs) that would violate the rule.\n- dev_dma_unmap (member of ops; function pointer declaration/signature): the function-pointer declaration may use nonstandard calling conventions, compiler attributes, or extension types (e.g. __attribute__, __cdecl), so its declaration must be checked.\n- struct metal_sg: the scatter/gather struct definition might include extensions (bit-fields, attributes, packed, anonymous unions) that are relevant to the rule.\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: this macro/enum value must be checked to see if it is defined using compiler-specific constructs or macros that expand to extensions.\n- atomic_thread_fence: although standard in C11, its project/header definition may map to a compiler builtin or inline assembly (e.g. __atomic_thread_fence or __sync intrinsics). You must inspect its definition to ensure no compiler-specific extension is used.\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: these constants/macros from the atomics header may be defined in terms of compiler-specific constructs; check their definitions for extensions.\n- uint32_t: an apparently standard typedef (stdint.h) \u2014 verify it comes from a standard header and is not redefined using an extension in the project headers.\n\nProvide these symbol definitions to the next analyzer so it can open their declarations/headers and decide whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used."
