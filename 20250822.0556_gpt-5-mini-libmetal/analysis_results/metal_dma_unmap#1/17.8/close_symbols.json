  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule checking that function parameters themselves are not modified, the analyzer needs the following symbols so it can rule out hidden/side\u2011effecting definitions or macro expansions and understand types/fields used:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: The comparison uses this symbol. Must confirm it is a simple constant/enum (no side effects or macro that could assign to 'dir').\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: This call could be a function or macro. The analyzer must know its definition to ensure it does not expand into code that modifies any of the function parameters (e.g. by name-mangling macros).\n\n- memory_order_release / memory_order_acq_rel: These arguments to atomic_thread_fence must be simple enum/constants. Confirm they are not macros with side effects that could modify parameters.\n\n- struct metal_device: Needed to verify that 'dev' is a pointer parameter (not a macro or unusual typedef) and to locate the 'bus' member access so we can determine whether any assignment to 'dev' itself occurs.\n\n- struct metal_bus: Needed to understand the type of dev->bus and ensure the bus field access is a normal dereference (no operator overloads/macros) and to find the 'ops' member.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops: Required to determine the type of dev_dma_unmap (is it a function pointer, inline function, or macro?) and its prototype so we can decide whether the call expression could possibly modify the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- dev->bus: Included explicitly to emphasize we must inspect the 'bus' member (its definition/initializer) to ensure the dev->bus access is not a macro that rebinds/assigns 'dev'.\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap: The actual symbol invoked. The analyzer must see its definition (or confirm it is a plain function pointer call) to ensure the call does not expand into code that assigns to the parameter variables (e.g. via weird macro expansion). Also to confirm its signature (parameters passed by value vs by pointer-to-parameter-address).\n\n- struct metal_sg: Needed to confirm 'sg' is a pointer type and to verify there are no macro/type tricks that would make 'sg' a non-pointer or otherwise allow the pointer variable itself to be modified implicitly.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer confirm (1) none of the parameter identifiers are assigned to in this function, (2) none of the called/macro-expanded operations can modify the parameter variables themselves, and (3) pointer parameters are only used in legal ways (the objects they point to may be modified, which is allowed)."
