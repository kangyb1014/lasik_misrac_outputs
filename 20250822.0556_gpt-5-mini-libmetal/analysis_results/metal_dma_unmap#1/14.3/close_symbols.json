  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions in metal_dma_unmap are invariant you must know whether their operand values can vary at runtime or are constant by construction. Specifically:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: needed to know the constant value being compared with dir (so you can tell if dir==METAL_DMA_DEV_R can ever change or is a comparison against a compile-time constant).\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): to understand the dev parameter layout (presence and type of the bus member) and any attributes on dev that could make it effectively non-null or constant.\n\n- type of dev->bus (e.g. struct metal_bus): to inspect the bus pointer semantics and whether bus is guaranteed present/constant for a device instance.\n\n- type of dev->bus->ops (e.g. struct metal_bus_ops): to see whether ops is a table of function pointers, whether its members are mutable, and whether dev_dma_unmap is a function pointer or macro/inline function.\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap and the functions assigned to it: to determine whether the dev_dma_unmap member can be NULL, is set once at initialization (thus invariant across calls), or varies at runtime. This directly affects whether the combined controlling expression \"!dev || !dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap || !sg\" can be considered invariant.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): to confirm sg is a pointer type and to check any annotations or semantics that might make sg effectively non-null or constant at call sites.\n\n- All callers of metal_dma_unmap (call sites and argument values): the invariance of a controlling expression inside this function may depend on how the function is used. If all call sites always pass the same dir value or non-NULL dev/sg, the expressions could be invariant in the whole program; you need the callers to prove or refute that.\n\n- All initializers/assignments that set dev->bus and dev->bus->ops: if the ops table (and dev_dma_unmap pointer) is populated once at device initialization and never changed, dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap might be invariant; you must inspect those initializers to decide.\n\n- Any non-null/contract annotations on metal_dma_unmap, struct metal_device, or the bus/ops fields: static annotations or documentation macros (e.g. __nonnull attributes, SAL annotations) can make certain checks redundant; these affect whether a controlling expression is truly invariant and thus are needed for a correct MISRA C determination.\n\nCollecting and analyzing these symbols (definitions, assignments and call sites) lets an analyzer determine if the two controlling expressions (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R and !dev || !dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap || !sg) can ever change at runtime or are invariant across the program, which is the criterion for the MISRA rule in question."
