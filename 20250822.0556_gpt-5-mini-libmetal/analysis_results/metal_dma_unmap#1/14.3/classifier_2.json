  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The macro definition #define METAL_DMA_DEV_R 1 by itself is not a controlling expression. In metal_dma_unmap the controlling expression is (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R), which depends on the variable dir and therefore is not invariant. A concrete violating scenario would be writing an invariant controlling expression such as if (METAL_DMA_DEV_R) { ... } or while (METAL_DMA_DEV_R) { ... } (these are always true and would breach Rule 14.3 unless used to create an intentional infinite loop),"
