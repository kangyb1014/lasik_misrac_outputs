  "explanation": "- memcmp: the MISRA rule specifically bans using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. You must inspect the memcmp symbol to detect any direct uses and to match calls in reachable code.\n- dev_dma_unmap (concrete implementation(s) referenced by dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap): metal_dma_unmap delegates work via the dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap function pointer. To determine whether this API path violates the memcmp rule you must examine the actual implementation(s) that can be invoked here for calls to memcmp (or patterns that compare NUL\u2011terminated strings with memcmp).\n- struct metal_bus_ops: you need the ops structure definition to locate the dev_dma_unmap function pointer declaration (signature) and to find where and how implementations are assigned.\n- struct metal_bus: needed to resolve the bus->ops member access so you can find the exact ops instance linked to dev at runtime (via static initialization or assignments) and thus link to the concrete implementation(s).\n- struct metal_device: needed to resolve the dev->bus relationship and locate how a metal_device instance gets its bus pointer (to trace which ops instance is in use).\n- Any functions transitively called by the concrete dev_dma_unmap implementation(s): if those implementations delegate further, you must inspect the entire reachable subtree for uses of memcmp comparing null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the memcmp declaration, the ops and device/bus/type definitions, the concrete dev_dma_unmap implementation(s), and their reachable callees) is sufficient to determine whether the target function and its delegated call path violate the MISRA rule."
