  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: in this fragment the function does not modify the objects pointed to, but it forwards dev and sg to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap. Because the called bus operation may legitimately modify the device or scatter-gather structure, the parameters cannot be safely made const here without inspecting/changing the callee\u2019s prototype. If the callee were guaranteed not to modify them, then making the parameters const would be appropriate, but that is not evident from this code alone."
