  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only performs NULL checks on existing pointer parameters. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer types should be declared to point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to objects are not modified. The shown code fragment does not declare the pointers and does not by itself violate the rule. (If, in the broader context, dev or sg are never modified and could be declared as const pointers, then the function signature should use const-qualified pointer types \u2014 that would be a violation of 8.13 in the current code.)"
