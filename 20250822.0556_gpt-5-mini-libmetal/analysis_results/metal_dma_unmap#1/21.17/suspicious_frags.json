  "explanation": "I inspected the provided metal_dma_unmap implementation and the related type definitions. There are no calls to any <string.h> functions (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn) anywhere in the shown code. The only operations are atomic_thread_fence calls, pointer null-checks, and an indirect call via the function pointer dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap. Because the rule targets uses of the Standard Library string functions, there are no in-scope fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in the supplied code. Note: the implementation of the function pointed to by dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap is not provided here; if that external implementation uses string.h functions, it should be inspected for out-of-bounds accesses, but that implementation is outside the provided code and therefore cannot be flagged as a suspicious fragment from the supplied source."
