  "scenario": "The macro METAL_DMA_DEV_R is defined as 1 and is used in a runtime comparison (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R). Both the if and else branches are reachable depending on the value of dir, so the code does not introduce unreachable code. There is no evidence in the provided fragment that any code path is impossible; therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated. (Only if elsewhere in the project dir were guaranteed always to equal METAL_DMA_DEV_R would the else branch be unreachable, but no such guarantee is present in the supplied code.)"
