  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in metal_dma_unmap is statically unreachable you must know any compile-time constants, macro/inline expansions and any callee attributes that could alter control flow. Specifically:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: The value of this macro/enum controls the first if branch (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R). If this macro is defined in a way that makes the comparison a constant expression (or is aliased to something that affects control flow), the branch might be folded away by the compiler or analyzer.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: This identifier might be a macro, inline function, or an implementation that could (in nonstandard cases) expand to code that changes control flow (e.g. contains a call with attributes). You need its definition to confirm it does not introduce unreachable code or hidden returns/gotos.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: These memory-order tokens might be macros or enum constants used as arguments to atomic_thread_fence; their definitions can affect whether the call is a constant-foldable expression or if the fence macro expands unexpectedly.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition, including type of member 'bus'): You must know the exact type of dev->bus (pointer vs embedded, member names and types) to determine whether the dev->bus dereference and subsequent ops lookup are well-formed and whether any compile-time aliasing or const qualifiers make code unreachable.\n\n- type/definition of dev->bus (the bus structure) and its member 'ops': The type of bus and its ops member determine whether ops is a pointer or struct, whether ops.dev_dma_unmap is actually a compile-time constant, macro, or function pointer, and whether the expression dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap can be resolved statically.\n\n- definition of the ops structure (type that contains dev_dma_unmap) and the dev_dma_unmap member: You need the exact declaration of the dev_dma_unmap member (is it a function pointer, macro alias, inline wrapper?) to determine if the null-check (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap) and the later call can be resolved as always true/false or if the call has attributes that affect control flow.\n\n- concrete dev_dma_unmap implementation/declaration (or macro) assigned to ops.dev_dma_unmap: If the implementation is annotated (e.g. noreturn) or if the symbol is actually a macro that expands to return/goto, it can make following code unreachable or change flow; you must inspect the actual callee definition.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): Although only tested for NULL in this function, its definition is needed to rule out any macro/typedef trickery that could make the null check a compile-time constant or otherwise affect reachability analysis.\n\nTogether these symbols let a static analyzer determine whether any branch or statement in metal_dma_unmap is provably never executed (unreachable) because of compile-time constants, macro expansions, or callee attributes. Without them the analyzer cannot safely conclude that any particular branch is unreachable."
