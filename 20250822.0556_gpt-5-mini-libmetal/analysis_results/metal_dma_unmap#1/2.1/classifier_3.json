  "scenario": "In the given fragment no unreachable code is introduced: the conditional return can be taken or not at run-time depending on the pointer values, so it is reachable. A violation would occur only if the condition is provably always false (or always true) by program invariants or static analysis. For example, if elsewhere in the project it is guaranteed (by construction or preceding checks) that dev is never NULL, dev->bus is never NULL and dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap is always non-NULL, then the return statement here would be unreachable (always bypassed) and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
