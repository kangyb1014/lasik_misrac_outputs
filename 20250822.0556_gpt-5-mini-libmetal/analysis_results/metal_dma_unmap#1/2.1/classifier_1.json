  "scenario": "The if/else branches are both potentially reachable: dir is a uint32_t parameter and may have values equal to METAL_DMA_DEV_R (1) or other values, so both the 'if' and the 'else' path can be executed at runtime. There is no compile-time constant that makes one branch impossible, therefore there is no unreachable code in the fragment."
