  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to determine whether the code is dead:\n\n- for_each_linux_bus (macro/iterator): Determines how the loop is expanded and whether it can ever iterate. If this macro expands to nothing or is conditional, the loop body may be unreachable/no-op.\n\n- linux-bus list head / container: The actual global/container object that for_each_linux_bus walks. Necessary to know whether any linux_bus instances exist at runtime and therefore whether the loop executes.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition \u2014 includes bus_name): Needed to know validity and semantics of lbus->bus_name (e.g., is it always NULL or empty) and whether accessing it has side effects. Also to understand how linux_bus instances are created/populated.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): Required to understand what unregistering a metal_bus does, whether the bus pointer returned by metal_bus_find can alias other state, and what state removal affects.\n\n- metal_bus_find (implementation): Must know whether it can return 0 for any linux bus_name, whether it has side effects, or whether it is effectively always non-zero (so the unregister is never called). This decides if the conditional call is reachable/operative.\n\n- metal_bus_unregister (implementation): Needed to know what removing a bus does (side effects on registries, resources freed, callbacks invoked). If unregister has observable effects, the loop body is not dead even if it runs rarely.\n\n- metal_list_del (implementation): metal_bus_unregister calls this; needed to determine the concrete side effects of unregister (removing nodes from lists), which bears on whether removing the call would change program behavior.\n\n- metal bus registry (global list/hashtable used by metal_bus_find/metal_bus_register): To decide whether removing the unregister calls would change the registry state and therefore program behavior; also to see how metal_bus_find queries it.\n\n- metal_bus_register (implementation): To know how/when metal buses are added to the registry and whether there exist entries that match linux bus names \u2014 affects whether the find+unregister path ever executes.\n\n- functions that create/register linux_bus entries (e.g. metal_linux_bus_register or equivalents): To determine whether linux_bus instances exist at the time metal_linux_bus_finish runs; if none are ever created, the loop is dead.\n\n- metal_sys_finish (caller) and metal_finish (higher-level caller): Needed to determine whether metal_linux_bus_finish is ever invoked in typical program execution (invocation timing/ordering). If the call chain is never reached, the entire function may be unreachable or dead; conversely, if invoked only in shutdown where unregister effects matter, the code may be necessary. These callers provide context for runtime reachability and timing, which is relevant under MISRA's dead-code considerations."
