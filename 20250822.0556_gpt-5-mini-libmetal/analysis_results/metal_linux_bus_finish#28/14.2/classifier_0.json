  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_bus_finish:\n```c\nvoid metal_linux_bus_finish(void)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_bus(lbus) {\n\t\tif (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)\n\t\t\tmetal_bus_unregister(bus);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_bus_finish:\n#define for_each_linux_bus(lbus) for((lbus)=linux_bus;(lbus)->bus_name;(lbus)++)\n...\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor_each_linux_bus(lbus) {\n\t\tif (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)\n\t\t\tmetal_bus_unregister(bus);\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the macro expands to for((lbus)=linux_bus; (lbus)->bus_name; (lbus)++). The first clause initializes the loop counter (lbus), the second clause is a read-only test that uses only the loop counter (no persistent side effects), and the third clause increments only the loop counter. There is a single loop counter (lbus) which is not modified in the loop body. (Note: this conclusion assumes metal_bus_find/metal_bus_unregister do not modify lbus or the pointed-to linux_bus->bus_name; if they did modify those objects, the second/third clause requirements could be violated.)"
