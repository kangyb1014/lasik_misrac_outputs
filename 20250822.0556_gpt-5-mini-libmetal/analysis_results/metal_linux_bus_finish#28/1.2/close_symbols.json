  "explanation": "for_each_linux_bus (macro definition): The loop uses this identifier; it is almost certainly a macro. Macros can hide compiler extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, typeof, nested scopes). You must inspect its expansion to detect any nonstandard language extensions.\n\nlist_for_each_entry / list_for_each (macro definitions used by above): The for_each_linux_bus macro commonly expands to one of the Linux list iteration macros. Those macros often rely on other macros or GCC extensions; their definitions must be checked.\n\ncontainer_of / list_entry (macro definitions): These helper macros frequently use offsetof, pointer arithmetic and sometimes typeof (a GCC extension). Their definitions are needed to see if typeof or other extensions are used.\n\nstruct linux_bus (type definition, including member bus_name): The code dereferences lbus->bus_name. The struct definition is needed to verify that bus_name has a standard type (e.g. char *) and that no compiler-specific extensions appear in the type (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, attributes, etc.).\n\nstruct metal_bus (type definition): metal_bus pointers are passed to/unregistered; the type definition must be checked for any nonstandard declarations or attributes attached to the type.\n\nstruct list_head (type definition): List macros operate on this type; its definition may reveal use of compiler-specific features or attributes.\n\nmetal_bus_find (declaration/definition): Its prototype or definition can contain compiler extensions (e.g. function attributes like __attribute__((...)), inline assembly, or nonstandard calling conventions) that would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nmetal_bus_unregister (declaration/definition): Same rationale as metal_bus_find \u2014 its declaration/definition may contain compiler extensions (attributes, inline, asm, etc.) and its implementation may use extensions indirectly.\n\nAny helper macros that for_each_linux_bus expands to (e.g. typeof, statement expressions): Some tokens (typeof, ({ ... })) are language extensions rather than plain symbols; include them by name so the analyzer can detect explicit use of GCC/other compiler extensions when the for_each_linux_bus expansion is examined.\n\nThese symbols together allow inspection of macro expansions, type declarations and function prototypes/definitions that are the likely locations for compiler-specific language extensions hidden from the simple source listing of metal_linux_bus_finish."
