  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required:\n- metal_bus_find (implementation/prototype): The target function does not call memcmp itself, so any violation would occur in callees. metal_bus_find is the primary callee that compares a name (lbus->bus_name) to find a bus; you must inspect its code to see whether it uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (and whether it treats the operands as C strings). The prototype is needed to know parameter semantics.\n- struct linux_bus (definition) / lbus->bus_name member type: To decide if a memcmp use in metal_bus_find would be comparing null-terminated strings, you need the exact type and layout of bus_name (e.g., char *, char[], fixed-size buffer, binary identifier). This determines whether comparing with memcmp would be a MISRA violation.\n- for_each_linux_bus (macro/iterator definition): To be sure how lbus and lbus->bus_name are produced and whether any lifetime or non-string encoding assumptions apply, inspect the iteration macro/implementation; it may also transform or supply non-string values.\n- metal_bus_unregister (implementation/prototype): Although less likely to perform name comparisons, metal_bus_unregister is invoked conditionally and should be inspected to ensure it does not itself perform any memcmp-on-string operations that would be relevant to the MISRA rule."
