  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any explicit byte-wise comparison) are present in this function. The code only: iterates over linux_bus structures (for_each_linux_bus), calls metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) and, on success, calls metal_bus_unregister(bus). There are no explicit string or buffer comparisons in this fragment, and no use of memcmp/strcmp/strncmp. The only string-like identifier (lbus->bus_name) is passed to metal_bus_find but not compared here; if necessary, the implementation of metal_bus_find should be inspected separately for misuse of memcmp, but that implementation is outside the provided code fragment and therefore not included as suspicious in this function."
