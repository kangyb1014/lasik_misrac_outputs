  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: lbus is a local variable declared in metal_linux_bus_finish, not a function parameter. The for_each_linux_bus(lbus) macro iterates by assigning to that local variable, which does not breach Rule 17.8. (A violation would occur if the macro assigned to or modified a pointer that was an incoming function parameter \u2014 e.g. if lbus were a function parameter and the macro wrote into it, that would violate the rule.)"
