  "explanation": "Only code locations that involve pointer declarations or pointer usage were selected because Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers could/should point to const-qualified types. Other parts of the snippet (the function signature, braces, the numeric comparison '== 0', and the general loop/flow structure) do not introduce pointer types or pointer-to-object conversions relevant to const-qualification and therefore do not need investigation for this rule. The selected fragments cover all occurrences where a pointer type or pointer value is declared, passed, or dereferenced and thus are the places to check whether const qualification is appropriate."
