  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If struct linux_bus declares bus_name as a non-const pointer (for example: char *bus_name) but the member is only read (here it is passed to metal_bus_find for lookup), then the pointer is not const-qualified even though it could be. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Fix: declare bus_name as const char *bus_name (and propagate const where appropriate). If, instead, bus_name is already declared const (const char *), then there is no violation."
