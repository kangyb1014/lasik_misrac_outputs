  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'bus' is obtained via metal_bus_find and then passed to metal_bus_unregister, an operation that likely modifies or consumes the object. Because the pointer is used for non-const operations (output of a finder and input to an unregister function), qualifying it as pointer-to-const would be inappropriate here."
