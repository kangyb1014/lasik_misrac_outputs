  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In metal_linux_bus_finish the local pointer lbus is only used for read access (iterating and reading lbus->bus_name) and is never used to modify the pointed object. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so lbus should be declared as const struct linux_bus *lbus; (or the for_each_linux_bus macro/interface should be changed to accept a const pointer). The only caveat would be if the for_each_linux_bus macro or some other code in that translation unit requires lbus to be a non-const pointer (i.e. writes through it); given the shown code and log, that is not the case. Recommendation: change the declaration to const struct linux_bus *lbus; or update the iteration macro to support const pointers."
