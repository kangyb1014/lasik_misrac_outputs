    "for_each_linux_bus(lbus) {",
    "if (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)\n\t\tmetal_bus_unregister(bus);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not present indications of unreachable code: the function signature and local declarations are ordinary; there are no return/goto/statements or code following an unconditional return that would create unreachable code; the single conditional and the unregister call are syntactically reachable depending on the runtime result of metal_bus_find. The only constructs that could hide unreachable code are the loop macro (for_each_linux_bus) and the conditional-without-braces as shown above, so only those fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 compliance."
