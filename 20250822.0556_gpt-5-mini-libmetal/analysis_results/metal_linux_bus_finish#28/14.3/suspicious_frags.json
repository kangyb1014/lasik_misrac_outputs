  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: the only other controlling expression is the if statement 'if (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)' which is not invariant because it depends on the per-iteration lbus value and the result of metal_bus_find. There are no do-while, while, switch or for loops (aside from the reported fragment) with obvious constant controlling expressions, and the declarations and function signature are not relevant to Rule 14.3."
