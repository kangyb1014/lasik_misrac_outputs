  ],
  "explanation": "1) metal_bus_find (implementation/prototype): The target passes lbus->bus_name into metal_bus_find. To check for out-of-bounds string accesses you must inspect metal_bus_find to see which <string.h> routines it uses and how it reads/writes the provided name (comparisons, copies, length checks, bounds used).  \n2) struct linux_bus (definition, including type/size of bus_name): You need the exact declaration of linux_bus and the bus_name member (is it char * or char array, and if an array what size). That determines the valid bounds for any string operations performed on bus_name.  \n3) for_each_linux_bus (macro or iterator implementation): This shows how lbus is obtained and its lifetime/validity during iteration (e.g., whether lbus can be NULL or freed concurrently), which is important to ensure the pointer passed to string functions is valid.  \n4) functions that create/initialize linux_bus objects or set lbus->bus_name (e.g. linux bus register/constructor): You must see where and how bus_name is assigned (allocated, strncpy/strcpy used, constant pointer assigned) to determine maximum length and whether prior copies could have overflowed or left non-terminated strings.  \n5) any string-handling functions called by metal_bus_find (e.g. strcmp/strncmp/strcpy/strncpy/memcpy/memmove): If metal_bus_find delegates to other helpers that call standard string routines, include those symbols/implementations to verify length arguments and ensure no access beyond object bounds.  \nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether passing lbus->bus_name into the called code can lead to out-of-bounds accesses by standard <string.h> functions."
