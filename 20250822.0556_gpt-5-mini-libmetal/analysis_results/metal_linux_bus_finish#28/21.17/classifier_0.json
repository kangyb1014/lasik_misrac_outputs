  "scenario": "The call itself does not directly call any <string.h> routines, so the fragment shown does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However a violation can occur if the implementation of metal_bus_find uses string.h functions unsafely. Example violation scenario: lbus->bus_name points to a non\u2011null\u2011terminated or undersized buffer and metal_bus_find does something like strcmp(lbus->bus_name, table[i].name) or strcpy(dest, lbus->bus_name). In that case strcmp/strcpy/strlen could read or write past the bounds of the object referenced by lbus->bus_name (or the destination), violating Rule 21.17."
