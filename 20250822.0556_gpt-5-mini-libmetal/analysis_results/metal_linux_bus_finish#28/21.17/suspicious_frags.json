  "explanation": "There are no direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) in this function body other than passing pointers into the two calls listed above. The for_each_linux_bus(lbus) macro/loop itself does not invoke string-handling functions in this snippet. Therefore the only locations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses via standard string functions are the calls that receive string-like data or structures (metal_bus_find(...) and metal_bus_unregister(...)); those calls should be investigated. No other fragments in this function directly involve string.h functions or pointer parameters that appear to reference string objects."
