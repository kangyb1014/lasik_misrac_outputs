  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I inspected the provided function and related definitions: there are no calls to memcmp anywhere. The code compares names using strcmp (appropriate for null-terminated strings) and performs a numeric size comparison using metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io). The struct definitions contain no functions or comparisons that use memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that match the rule violation and nothing else needs to be investigated for this specific MISRA rule."
