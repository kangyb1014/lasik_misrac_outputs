  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must be able to see whether this function (or anything it invokes or expands to) uses memcmp on C strings and whether the compared objects are null\u2011terminated strings: \n\n- strcmp: the function used in the code. Verify that this identifier is the standard strcmp (and not #defined to something that uses memcmp). \n- memcmp: include this symbol to detect any indirect or aliased use (e.g. strcmp mapped to memcmp, or macros/wrappers calling memcmp). \n- struct metal_generic_shmem: definition is needed to know types of members (in particular the name member and io member). \n- shmem->name (member): you must confirm this member is a null\u2011terminated C string (or not). That determines whether comparing it with memcmp would violate the MISRA rule. \n- struct metal_io_region: definition of the io member to ensure metal_io_region_size semantics do not affect string handling. \n- metal_io_region_size: prototype/implementation to ensure it does not perform any string comparisons via memcmp. \n- metal_list_for_each (macro): expand/definition is needed to ensure iteration is over the expected nodes and that no hidden memcmp use appears in the macro. \n- metal_container_of (macro): inspect expansion to ensure it simply computes container pointer and does not invoke memcmp. \n- struct metal_list: definition of list node type to validate what nodes contain and how name is populated. \n- _metal (global) / _metal.common.generic_shmem_list: definition of the list head and any initialization code that populates entries (to trace where names come from and whether they are NUL\u2011terminated). \n- ENOENT: the error macro/constant (for completeness; not directly related to the MISRA rule but required to fully understand return semantics).\n\nWith these symbols you can determine (1) whether strcmp used here is equivalent to a memcmp-based implementation or macro, and (2) whether shmem->name is a null\u2011terminated string (so a memcmp use would be a MISRA violation)."
