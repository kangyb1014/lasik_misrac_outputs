  "explanation": "You need the following symbols to determine whether pointers in metal_shmem_open_generic should be const-qualified and whether any const is being violated:\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Shows the exact type and its members, and whether those members (or the whole type) are or must be treated as const. Required to decide if returning a pointer to a non-const metal_io_region (via result) is appropriate.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem\n  - Required to know the types of shmem->io and shmem->name. In particular, whether shmem->io is mutable or declared const, and whether shmem->name is const-qualified (affects strcmp usage and whether any const is discarded).\n\n- metal_io_region_size (prototype)\n  - To see whether this function accepts a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const metal_io_region. If it takes a non-const pointer, that influences whether &shmem->io must be non-const; if it accepts a const pointer, it suggests metal_io_region can be treated as const in read-only contexts.\n\n- metal_shmem_open (declaration / caller code)\n  - The caller of metal_shmem_open_generic: needed to inspect how the returned result (struct metal_io_region *) is used by callers. If callers modify the region through the returned pointer, it cannot be const. If they only read it, result might be const-qualified.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (prototype / code)\n  - metal_shmem_open (the caller) calls this function (per the static call graph). If metal_shmem_open forwards the result pointer to metal_shmem_try_map (or other callees), you must inspect those callee prototypes/uses to see whether they require a non-const pointer (i.e., perform modifications) or accept a const pointer.\n\n- metal_open (prototype / code)\n  - Also called by metal_shmem_open; included because the call chain from the caller may further use or modify the result. Required to determine whether returned pointer must be mutable.\n\n- struct metal_list\n  - The list node type used by metal_list_for_each; needed to understand any constness constraints on iteration and whether list APIs require mutable nodes (which could imply mutable shmem objects).\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro)\n  - The macro implementation can perform casts that add/remove const qualifiers (or require a particular pointer type). Inspecting it ensures no const is discarded by iteration.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro)\n  - This macro can perform pointer arithmetic/casts to derive the containing struct from the node pointer. Its definition may cast away const; you must verify it preserves const qualifiers so that &shmem->io is not obtained by removing const.\n\nTogether these symbols let you determine: (a) the precise types involved and their const qualifications; (b) whether helper macros/functions cast away or require const; and (c) whether callers or callees expect to modify the returned metal_io_region. That information is necessary to decide whether the parameter struct metal_io_region **result (and the assignment *result = &shmem->io) violates the MISRA guidance that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
