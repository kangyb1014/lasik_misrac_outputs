  "explanation": "I did not include the following fragments because they do not indicate a potential Rule 8.13 issue: \n- const char *name (already const-qualified).\n- const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap (already const-qualified).\n- Non-pointer members of struct metal_io_region (size, page_shift, page_mask, mem_flags) and the ops member \u2014 Rule 8.13 applies to pointer types only.\n- struct metal_generic_shmem { ... struct metal_list node; } \u2014 node is an embedded struct (not a pointer), so Rule 8.13 is not applicable.\n- Any comment lines or macro invocations (e.g., metal_list_for_each) were not flagged because they are not pointer declarations that could be const-qualified themselves.  \nThe listed fragments are those pointer declarations/uses in the provided code that could plausibly be const-qualified and therefore warrant investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
