  "explanation": "No code fragments in metal_shmem_open_generic modify any function parameter itself. Specific points: \n- The only write to a pointer parameter is *result = &shmem->io; this modifies the object referred to by the pointer parameter (the caller's pointer), which is permitted by Rule 17.8; the parameter variable result itself is not reassigned. \n- name is passed to strcmp (reads only) and is declared const char *, so it is not modified. \n- size is used only in a comparison and is not modified. \n- The loop uses a local variable node and the list macro expands to operations on the list object, not on any function parameter. \n- Assignments (shmem = metal_container_of(...)) write to local variables only. \nTherefore there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
