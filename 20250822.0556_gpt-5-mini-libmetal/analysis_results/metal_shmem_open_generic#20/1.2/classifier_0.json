  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation at the call site: the fragment is a plain macro invocation (metal_container_of(...)) and does not by itself use any compiler language extension. To determine a true Rule 1.2 violation you must inspect the definition of the metal_container_of macro. If that macro uses non\u2011standard features (for example GCC extensions such as typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), or other compiler\u2011specific builtins), then Rule 1.2 would be violated; otherwise there is no violation."
