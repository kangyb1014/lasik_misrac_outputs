  "explanation": "For checking violations of the MISRA rule forbidding compiler language extensions you must inspect any macro or definition that could hide use of compiler-specific extensions. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): This macro commonly uses GCC extensions (e.g. typeof/__typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or compiler attributes). You must examine its exact macro definition to detect any use of language/compiler extensions.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): Looping/list macros sometimes use typeof or statement-expressions for type-safe iteration. Inspect its definition for extensions (typeof, ({ ... }), __attribute__, inline asm, etc.).\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (type/definition): The container_of macro operates on this type; the struct definition itself might include compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((packed/aligned)), non-standard bit-field usage) that are language extensions. Check the declaration.\n\n- struct metal_list (type/definition): The for-each macro operates on this type (next/prev members). The struct declaration could include extensions or nonstandard constructs; inspect it.\n\n- _metal (global) / _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (declaration): The list head referenced in the iteration is defined here. Its declaration/initialization might use compiler extensions (compound literals with GNU extensions, attributes, designated initializer extensions). Inspect the declaration and initializer.\n\n- metal_io_region (type/definition): The function uses metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io). The struct definition may carry attributes or use nonstandard constructs; check it to ensure no extensions are used in types passed to or used by the target.\n\n- metal_io_region_size (definition/implementation): Although called from the target, its implementation may use language extensions (inline asm, typeof, statement-expressions, GCC attributes). Inspect its body/definition to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are employed.\n\n(Notes: standard library items used here, e.g. strcmp or offsetof from stddef.h, are standard C and only need inspection if macros above expand to use compiler-specific tokens like typeof or statement expressions. The items above are the minimal additional symbols whose definitions must be inspected to determine whether the target function or its immediate dependencies employ compiler language extensions.)"
