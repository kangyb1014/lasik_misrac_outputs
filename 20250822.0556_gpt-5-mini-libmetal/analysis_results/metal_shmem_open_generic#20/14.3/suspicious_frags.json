  "explanation": "The other control expressions in the function do not appear to be invariant and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: \n- if (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0) continue; \u2014 strcmp depends on runtime inputs (shmem->name and name), so the condition is not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)) { ... } \u2014 the comparison uses the runtime parameter size and a per-iteration value returned by metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io), so it is not invariant across iterations.\n- The return statements and final return -ENOENT; are not controlling expressions and are not relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore only the metal_list_for_each(...) loop construct should be investigated to ensure its expanded controlling expression is not an invariant."
