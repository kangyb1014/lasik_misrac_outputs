  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" you must know exactly how the loop and the if expressions can change at runtime. Why each is required:\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): The loop\u2019s controlling expression is produced by this macro. You must see its expansion to determine whether the loop uses a changing iterator (e.g. node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next) or is written in a way that could be invariant (infinite/always-false or always-true).\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): Converts the list node to the containing struct (shmem). If this macro were miswritten or unusual, the value of shmem could be invariant across iterations; you need its definition to ensure shmem varies as expected.\n\n- struct metal_list (fields: next, prev or equivalent): The list node structure and field names/types are required to understand how iteration advances and whether node comparisons in the loop condition can change.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (fields: name, io, node): You must know that shmem->name and shmem->io are per-element fields (not e.g. statically constant) so that the controlling expressions that read shmem->name or shmem->io can vary across iterations.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (layout used by metal_io_region_size): To interpret what metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io) returns and whether it can vary per shmem instance you need the io-region structure layout.\n\n- _metal and its type (particularly _metal.common.generic_shmem_list initialization/semantics): The loop iterates over _metal.common.generic_shmem_list. You must know how that global is initialized/maintained (empty list, sentinel pointing to itself, concurrency or immutability) to decide if the loop\u2019s controlling expression can be invariant.\n\n- metal_io_region_size (implementation): The if condition uses its return value. You need the function body to know whether it can return different values for different shmem->io instances or whether it is constant/invariant.\n\n- strcmp (declaration/semantics): The code tests strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0; understanding strcmp semantics (and whether shmem->name can be NULL or fixed) is necessary to decide if that comparison can vary across iterations.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the loop\u2019s and if-statements\u2019 controlling expressions can change at runtime or are invariant (and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated)."
