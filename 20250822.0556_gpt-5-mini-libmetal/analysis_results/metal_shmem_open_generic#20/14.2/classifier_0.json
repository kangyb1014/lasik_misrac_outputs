  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_open_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_open_generic(const char *name, size_t size,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_io_region **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_generic_shmem *shmem;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node) {\n\t\tshmem = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\tif (size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)) {\n\t\t\t*result = &shmem->io;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node) {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the metal_list_for_each macro typically expands to a single for loop such as for (node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next). That uses a single loop counter (node) initialized in the first clause, a condition that references the counter and the (unmodified) list head, and an iteration expression that updates only the counter. The loop body in the supplied code does not modify the loop counter or the list head, so Rule 14.2 is not violated. (Note: if the macro expanded differently \u2014 e.g. introduced multiple counters, had side effects in the condition, or the body modified the loop counter or objects used in the condition \u2014 then a violation could occur.)"
