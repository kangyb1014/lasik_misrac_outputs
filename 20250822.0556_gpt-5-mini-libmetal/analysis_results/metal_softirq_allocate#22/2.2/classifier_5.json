  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_allocate:\n```c\nint metal_softirq_allocate(int num)\n{\n\tint irq_base;\n\n\tif ((metal_softirq_avail + num) >= metal_softirq_num) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"No more available soft irqs\\n\");\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tirq_base = metal_softirq_avail;\n\tirq_base += metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base;\n\tmetal_softirq_avail += num;\n\treturn irq_base;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ((metal_softirq_avail + num) >= metal_softirq_num) {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-statement performs a runtime bounds check to prevent allocating more soft IRQs than available; removing it would change program behaviour (it would allow out\u2011of\u2011range allocations). Therefore the code is not dead. (If in a specific build/config metal_softirq_avail and metal_softirq_num made the condition never true, the inner block would be unreachable \u2014 but unreachable code is not classified as dead code by Rule 2.2.)"
