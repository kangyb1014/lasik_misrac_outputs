  "explanation": "For MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, we must examine any pointer usages reachable from metal_softirq_allocate. Although the function has no explicit local pointers, the call to metal_log and the globals it references are the only places pointers could appear or be propagated: \n\n- metal_log (declaration/prototype and any macro wrapper/implementation): The logging call passes a string literal (and possibly varargs). If metal_log's prototype takes a char * (non-const) for the format argument, that would violate the MISRA guidance because a string literal should be treated as const char *. Therefore the exact prototype (or macro expansion/implementation) is required to determine whether its parameter is const-qualified.\n\n- the format string literal \"No more available soft irqs\\n\": String literals are conceptually immutable and should be bound to const char *. Knowing how the compiler and the metal_log prototype treat this literal (type seen at the call site) is necessary to decide if a const qualification is missing.\n\n- metal_softirq_avail (declaration and type): This global is read and updated. If its declaration were a pointer type (or volatile/const-qualified in a way that affects pointer constness), that could change whether const qualification is required. The exact declaration shows whether any pointer types are involved.\n\n- metal_softirq_num (declaration and type): Used in the comparison; if this symbol were a pointer type (unlikely but must be confirmed) its qualification would matter. The declaration confirms no hidden pointer usage.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr (struct/union type definition and its member irq_base declaration/type): The code reads metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base. We must confirm irq_base's type is an integer (not a pointer). If irq_base were a pointer type, then the addition and assignment semantics and any needed const qualification for that pointer must be checked. The full type/definition ensures no pointer is being used implicitly.\n\nCollecting these symbol declarations/definitions lets the analyzer determine whether any pointers are passed or used unqualified (non-const) and thus whether the MISRA pointer-to-const rule is violated."
