  "explanation": "Only the two code regions above are flagged for investigation with respect to unreachable code: the conditional early-return block (which, if the condition is effectively always true due to configuration/initialization or integer overflow, would make the remainder of the function unreachable) and the allocation path that would be unreachable if the early-return is always taken. Other fragments are not reported because they do not themselves constitute unreachable code constructs: the local declaration (int irq_base;) is inert, and the metal_log call is a normal diagnostic call (its behaviour should be checked separately but the call site is not syntactically unreachable). The rest of the code is simple, conditionally reachable logic (either the function returns with an error or proceeds to compute and return irq_base), so there are no additional obvious unreachable-code fragments in the supplied function body."
