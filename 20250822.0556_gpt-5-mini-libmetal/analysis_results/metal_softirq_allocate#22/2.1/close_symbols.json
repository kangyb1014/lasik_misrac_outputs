  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_avail: The function\u2019s branch condition and the non-error path depend on this global variable. You need its declaration, initialisation semantics, mutability (volatile/atomic), and possible value range to decide whether the if condition can ever be false (i.e. whether the code after the if is reachable).\n- metal_softirq_num: As with metal_softirq_avail, this global defines the upper bound used in the if condition. Its declaration/initial value/constness and range are required to determine if the condition is always true (which would make the remainder of the function unreachable).\n- metal_softirq_cntr (and its type / .irq_base): The code adds metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base to irq_base and returns it. You need the definition and type of this symbol (and whether irq_base can be modified elsewhere) to evaluate reachability implications tied to the returned path and to detect any macros/side effects that could affect control flow.\n- metal_log (prototype and attributes): The call metal_log(...) appears on the error path. If metal_log is declared with a noreturn attribute or expands to a call that does not return (e.g. calls exit/longjmp), then the subsequent return -EINVAL would be unreachable; its prototype/attributes and macro expansion (if any) are needed to detect that.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: This token is passed to metal_log and might be a macro that expands to more than a simple enum (potentially affecting control flow). Knowing its definition rules out unexpected control-flow effects from its expansion.\n- EINVAL: The returned error value; you need its definition only to confirm it is a simple compile-time constant and that its use does not induce unexpected control flow (usually not required but included to be complete).\n\nNote: To determine MISRA unreachable-code violations you also need any API/contract information about valid ranges for the parameter num and any concurrency/interrupt semantics affecting the globals (e.g. whether metal_softirq_avail/metal_softirq_num can change asynchronously). These are not symbols per se but must be considered during analysis."
