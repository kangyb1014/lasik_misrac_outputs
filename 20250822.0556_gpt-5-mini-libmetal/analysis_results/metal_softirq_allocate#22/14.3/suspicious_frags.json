  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions. The function contains only one controlling construct (the if statement) \u2014 there are no loops or other conditional constructs to consider. The remaining lines are assignments, a function call (metal_log), and return statements, which are not controlling expressions and therefore not subject to Rule 14.3. No do-while constant-false or intentional infinite-loop exceptions are present in this function."
