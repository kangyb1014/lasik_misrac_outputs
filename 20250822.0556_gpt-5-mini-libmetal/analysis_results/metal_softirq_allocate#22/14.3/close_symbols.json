  "explanation": "To determine whether the controlling expression (metal_softirq_avail + num) >= metal_softirq_num is invariant, the analyser must know whether the operands can change between evaluations or across calls:\n\n- metal_softirq_avail: its declaration (type, storage class, and especially volatile/const qualifiers and initializer) tells whether its value is fixed or can vary. The set of all write-sites (functions, interrupt handlers, initialisers) is required to know whether it can be modified (and thus make the expression non-invariant).\n\n- metal_softirq_num: same rationale as above \u2014 if this is a compile-time constant (const, #define) the comparison could be invariant; if it is writable/volatile the comparison may vary.\n\n- Definitions of any functions/interrupt-handlers/threads that modify metal_softirq_avail or metal_softirq_num: knowing only the names is not enough \u2014 their bodies show when and how the globals are updated (concurrent contexts, atomicity, ordering). These writers determine whether the controlling expression can change.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_ERROR: although not part of the controlling expression, metal_log could have side effects (via macros or functions) that alter globals. The declaration/definition and related logging macros must be checked to rule out hidden modifications that affect invariance.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr and irq_base member: while not used in the controlling expression, its declaration is needed to ensure there is no aliasing or shared storage relationship (e.g., if metal_softirq_avail is derived from or overlays this structure) that could make the comparison invariant or otherwise affect semantics.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations and the code that writes to the identified globals) is sufficient to decide whether the controlling expression is invariant under the MISRA rule or whether permitted exceptions apply."
