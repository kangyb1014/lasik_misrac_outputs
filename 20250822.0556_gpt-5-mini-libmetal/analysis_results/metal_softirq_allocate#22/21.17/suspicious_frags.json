  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 were found. The function contains no calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The only function call is metal_log with a string literal (not a string.h operation) and there are no pointer parameters passed to any string-handling routines. The arithmetic and bounds check (metal_softirq_avail + num >= metal_softirq_num) do not involve string operations; therefore there are no code fragments that could violate Rule 21.17. (Note: unrelated issues such as potential integer overflow in the addition are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
