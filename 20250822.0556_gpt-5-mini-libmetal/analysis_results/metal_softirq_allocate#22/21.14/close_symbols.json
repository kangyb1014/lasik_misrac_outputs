  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_avail: global integer used/updated by the target. Include to inspect its declaration/initializer (no direct memcmp use expected, but needed to see if any accessor macros/functions invoke string operations.\n- metal_softirq_num: global limit compared against metal_softirq_avail; include to verify its type and any accessor macros that could hide calls (e.g., function-like macros that might call other code).\n- metal_softirq_cntr: global struct containing irq_base; include to examine its definition and any accessor functions/macros that might call other functions (potentially using memcmp).\n- metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base: the specific member read by the function; include to confirm its type and any side-effecting accessors.\n- metal_log: function called when the error path is taken. This is the primary transitive callee: its implementation and any functions it calls must be inspected for any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: log-level macro/constant passed to metal_log; include because macro expansions can introduce code (strings, helper calls) that must be inspected for memcmp usage.\n- EINVAL: error macro returned by the function; include to check if it is a simple constant or a macro with side effects (unlikely, but included for completeness).\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule. Include so the analyzer can quickly find any direct uses of memcmp in the target function and in all transitive callees (notably metal_log and its callees) to determine if memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nRationale: the target function itself contains no memcmp calls. To determine a MISRA violation you must inspect all symbols it references (globals, macros, and called functions) and their transitive callees/expansions for any memcmp use comparing NUL-terminated strings. The symbols above are the minimal set required to perform that reachability/usage analysis."
