  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_softirq_allocate violates the MISRA rule forbidding self-calls (direct or indirect), we must examine every function it calls and the entire call chain those calls may invoke, to see if any path leads back to metal_softirq_allocate.\n\n- metal_log: This is the only direct function call in metal_softirq_allocate. You must inspect its definition/implementation and call graph to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_softirq_allocate.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: Although likely just a severity constant, it could be a macro that expands into code that performs additional calls (or selects different logging backends). Include its definition to be sure it does not introduce calls that could reach metal_softirq_allocate.\n\n- All transitive callees of metal_log (e.g. backend logging functions, vfprintf/fprintf/printf, write, syslog, platform-specific helpers): Any function that metal_log calls (and any functions those call, recursively) must be available for analysis because an indirect recursion could traverse through one of them back to metal_softirq_allocate.\n\n- Any function pointers or callbacks referenced/used by metal_log (and their targets): If metal_log dispatches to function pointers or callbacks (logger backends, hooks), those targets must be included because they can create indirect call paths back to metal_softirq_allocate.\n\n- Any macros or inline helpers that expand to function calls in the logging invocation: Macros or inline functions used in the logging call site can hide additional calls; include their definitions to ensure no hidden path to metal_softirq_allocate exists.\n\nYou do not need the global data variables (metal_softirq_avail, metal_softirq_num, metal_softirq_cntr) or EINVAL numeric value to determine recursive calls, because they are data references only and do not affect call relationships."
