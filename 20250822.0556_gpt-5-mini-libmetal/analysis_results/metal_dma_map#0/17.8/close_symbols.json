  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_dma_map modifies any of its parameter variables (violating the MISRA rule), the analyzer must inspect any symbols that could (a) rebind/assign those parameter identifiers in this function or (b) expand/call into code that could. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_device: needed to know the type/layout of 'dev' (is bus a real member, a macro, or something unusual) and whether accessing dev->bus could be a macro that reassigns 'dev'.\n\n- struct metal_bus: needed to inspect the type of the 'bus' member (e.g. whether ops is a pointer/array or uses accessors/macros that might modify parameters).\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops: required to obtain the exact declared type of dev_dma_map (the function-pointer field). The pointer signature determines whether callers pass addresses-of parameters (which could allow callee to modify the caller's parameter variables) or pass by-value pointers only.\n\n- struct metal_sg: to confirm the actual type of sg_in/sg_out (in case the typedef hides pointer/indirection differences that affect whether passing sg_in/sg_out could lead to modification of the parameter variables themselves).\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map (function-pointer declaration/type): the declaration (prototype) shows what argument types are actually passed. If the field is a macro or has a different signature (e.g. taking pointers-to-pointers), that could permit modification of the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- All concrete implementations of dev_dma_map reachable in the static call graph: any implementation that is invoked (via the function pointer) must be inspected to ensure it is not a macro/inline that modifies the caller's parameter variables (for example, if an implementation macro manipulates or reassigns names that map back to the caller's parameters). Even though passing a pointer by value normally cannot change the caller's pointer variable, a mismatched signature or macro-based implementation could.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: the value controls which fence is used. Include it to check whether it is a macro or expression with side effects (unlikely but necessary to rule out parameter modification via macro expansion).\n\n- atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel: include the fence function and the memory_order constants to confirm they are plain functions/constants (no macros) and do not perform hidden operations that could modify any of the function's parameter variables via weird macro expansions.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to verify (1) there are no assignments to the parameter identifiers inside metal_dma_map, and (2) none of the called or expanded symbols (function-pointer target(s) or macros) can cause the parameter variables themselves to be modified. Inspecting these will allow a conclusive MISRA C assessment."
