  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: needed to know the exact type of the member `bus` (pointer vs embedded struct) and whether that member can be guaranteed non-NULL by construction. This affects whether the check `if (!dev || !sg_in || !sg_out)` or the subsequent dereference `dev->bus->ops` may be redundant (unreachable) or necessary.\n\n- struct metal_bus: required to see the type/layout of the `bus` object and the `ops` member (is `ops` a pointer or an embedded struct?). If `ops` is always present/non-NULL by design, the `if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map)` test might be provably unreachable (or conversely, if ops can be NULL the call might be unreachable), so the definition is needed to judge reachability.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (including dev_dma_map prototype): the function-pointer member type and its presence/absence in the ops struct determine whether the runtime test and the subsequent call can ever be bypassed. If dev_dma_map is not a pointer or is guaranteed non-NULL by the ops type/initialization, the `if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map)` branch may be unreachable; if it can be NULL the later call may be unreachable. The exact prototype is also needed to know whether the call expression is well-formed.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R and other METAL_DMA_* constants/enums: to determine whether both the `if (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R)` branch and the `else` branch are reachable you must know the possible set of values for `dir` and how METAL_DMA_DEV_R is defined (value, mask, or bitfield). If METAL_DMA_DEV_R covers all possible values or is identical to other constants, one branch could be provably unreachable.\n\n- Initializers/registration code that assign bus->ops: reachability of the `if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map)` test and of the call depends on how and where ops are initialized. If every valid metal_bus instance is initialized with a dev_dma_map pointer (or never has it), that makes one branch unreachable. Examining the code that constructs/assigns ops instances (or any global/static ops instances) is necessary to prove that.\n\n- Prototype/implementations assigned to dev_dma_map: if concrete implementations are always provided (or never provided) for all supported buses, the runtime null test and/or the call site may be unreachable. Having the actual implementations/registrations helps prove reachability of the call or the return path.\n\n- (Optional) atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_* definitions: these do not affect control flow in this function, but including their declarations can help a verifier rule out any hidden compile-time macro expansion that could alter control flow. They are low priority for reachability analysis but sometimes required for a complete static picture.\n\nOnly the symbols that can affect control-flow conditions in metal_dma_map (structure layout/invariants, values of `dir`, and initialization of ops/dev_dma_map) are necessary to decide whether any branch is provably unreachable under MISRA C's unreachable-code rule."
