  "explanation": "I only flagged code fragments that declare or pass pointers that could reasonably require review for possible const-qualification. Fragments not listed were not considered suspicious for the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 for these reasons: (1) Existing pointer declarations that are already const-qualified (for example the device name pointer) do not need investigation. (2) Non-pointer entities (integers, enums, return codes, array objects) are not relevant to this rule. (3) Calls to functions or uses of atomic operations are usages, not pointer declarations; without the callee's prototype/type information it is not possible to judge const-qualification from the call site alone. (4) Some pointers in an API are intentionally mutable because they are outputs or represent objects that are expected to be modified; such cases require semantic/contextual review (not a blanket constification) and therefore were only flagged where the declaration or parameter suggests a potential missed const qualification. Other code lines/expressions in the provided snippets do not present pointer declarations or obvious opportunities to add const and thus were not included."
