If the io pointer is intended only to reference a device/region descriptor (i.e. it is not modified via the scatter\u2011gather entry), it should be declared 'const struct metal_io_region *io;'. In the shown code, sg entries (and sg_in passed into metal_dma_map) are used as inputs only and are not modified, so leaving io non-const permits unintended modification and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_map:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence shown. MISRA 8.13 recommends using a pointer-to-const when the pointed-to object is never modified through that pointer, but you must demonstrate that the object is in fact never modified in the current API and call graph. In the provided code: (1) metal_dma_map takes non-const struct metal_sg * (both sg_in and sg_out) and passes them to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map; the op has a non-const signature and could modify the sg entries (especially sg_out). (2) The same struct metal_sg type is used for both input and output entries; that means the field type must support potential modification in some uses. (3) No evidence is shown that struct metal_io_region *io is always read-only in all callers. Because of those facts, you cannot conclude the pointer should be const without a full API-level review. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim of a definite MISRA 8.13 violation is not correct based on the provided code."
