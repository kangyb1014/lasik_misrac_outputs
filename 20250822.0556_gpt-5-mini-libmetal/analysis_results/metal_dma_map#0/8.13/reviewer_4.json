According to Rule 8.13 the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. const struct metal_device *dev). This is a violation unless dev must be passed to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map which requires a non-const pointer; if that callee does not modify the device, the parameter here should still be const-qualified.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_map:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although metal_dma_map does not modify *dev locally, it forwards dev to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map(dev->bus, dev, ...). The operation pointer in the bus ops is (almost certainly) declared to take a non-const struct metal_device *; therefore metal_dma_map cannot change its parameter type to const without creating an incompatible call/ABI or changing the ops API. MISRA rule 8.13 encourages const qualification when possible, but it is not applicable here because the pointer must match the callee's (non-const) API. (The same reasoning applies to sg_in/sg_out: they are forwarded to the ops call.) If the ops API were changed to accept a const pointer, then metal_dma_map could be updated; otherwise no violation exists."
