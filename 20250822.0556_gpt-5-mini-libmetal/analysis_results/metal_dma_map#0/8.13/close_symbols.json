  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: the function takes \"struct metal_device *dev\" and uses dev->bus. You must see the definition to know the exact type of the bus field and whether the device object is intended to be modified here (affects whether dev could be a pointer-to-const).\n\n- struct metal_bus (the type of dev->bus): metal_dma_map dereferences dev->bus and passes it to dev_dma_map. You need the bus type to determine whether the bus pointer itself or its contents are expected to be modified, and how that impacts const-qualification of the dev->bus pointer and of the dev parameter.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (the type of dev->bus->ops): this struct contains the dev_dma_map function pointer. Its definition shows the expected signatures and const qualifiers for parameters like the bus and SG descriptors; those signatures govern whether metal_dma_map can/should use const pointers for its parameters.\n\n- dev_dma_map (the prototype / function-pointer type declared in metal_bus_ops): this is the key symbol. metal_dma_map passes dev, dir, sg_in, nents_in, sg_out to this call. If the dev_dma_map prototype expects non-const pointers (e.g., struct metal_sg * rather than const struct metal_sg *), then metal_dma_map cannot (without casting) change its parameter types to const. Conversely, if the prototype uses const for input SGs or for the device/bus, that supports making metal_dma_map parameters const. The prototype also indicates whether sg_in is treated as input-only or is modified by implementations.\n\n- struct metal_sg: to decide whether sg_in (and/or sg_out) could be const-qualified you need the SG structure definition to know whether its fields are logically input-only or commonly modified by DMA-mapping helpers/implementations. Also useful to check existing usage patterns (e.g., are SG entries updated in device DMA map implementations).\n\nNote: to fully conclude if const-qualification is possible you may also need to inspect implementations of dev_dma_map (concrete functions registered in various bus drivers) to see whether they modify the SG list or device/bus objects. If available, include those implementation symbols for a complete analysis."
