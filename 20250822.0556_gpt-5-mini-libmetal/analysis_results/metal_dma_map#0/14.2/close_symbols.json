Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is needed for MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): The target accesses dev->bus; the concrete types and field names (bus) are needed to resolve which bus/ops object is used and therefore which dev_dma_map implementation is reachable. To find any for-loops in callees you must know the type layout to resolve call targets.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): The code uses dev->bus and passes dev->bus into dev_dma_map; the bus type is necessary to resolve the ops table and dispatch target(s).\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (definition): Contains the dev_dma_map function pointer. Its declaration shows the exact function-pointer type/signature and the field name used to call the callee; required to locate all possible implementations and inspect them for for-loops.\n\n- dev_dma_map function pointer declaration (signature): Explicit prototype is required to identify the function(s) being invoked and to find their definitions in the codebase for loop inspection.\n\n- All concrete implementations of dev_dma_map: The target function contains no for-loop itself, but MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of a loop body. Any for-loops that could violate the rule will be in these implementations (or their callees), so you must examine every implementation reachable via the ops dispatch.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): Parameter type used in the call; necessary to trace data flow into callee implementations which may contain for-loops that iterate over sg arrays/structures. Knowing the type helps detect loop counters and side effects on objects modified in loop bodies.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence (declaration/implementation): The target calls this. Although unlikely to contain for-loops, its definition must be checked because functions called from within a for-loop body count toward the for-loop's behaviour (if any code calling atomic_thread_fence appears inside a for-loop elsewhere).\n\n- memory_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel (enum/macro): Values passed to atomic_thread_fence; include their definitions to fully resolve atomic_thread_fence usage and to locate any macro-wrapped code that could contain loops.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R (macro/enum): The branch on dir affects which memory barrier is used and could affect control flow; include to resolve conditional behaviour and to find any macros that expand into code with loops.\n\n- EINVAL, ENODEV (error macro definitions): These affect control flow (early returns). Knowing their definitions helps static analysis compositionality; they might expand to expressions or macros that include code (rare, but necessary to be thorough) and to confirm early-return paths exclude or include certain callees.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by each dev_dma_map implementation: MISRA requires that the behaviour of the for-loop body includes behaviour of functions called within that statement. Thus you must inspect the entire call tree rooted at each dev_dma_map implementation to find any for-loops and determine whether their three clauses obey the rule (loop counter usage, side effects, single counter, modifications in body, and modifications via called functions).\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to resolve dynamic dispatch from dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map, to find all reachable callee implementations, and to inspect their bodies (and their callees) for any for-loops that might violate the MISRA rule."
