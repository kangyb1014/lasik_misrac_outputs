You must inspect the actual function(s) it points to to see whether memcmp is used there on null\u2011terminated strings.\\n- Definitions/implementations assigned to dev_dma_map: The concrete implementations placed in bus ops tables contain the code that will execute at runtime; inspect their bodies for memcmp usage and whether they compare null\u2011terminated strings.\\n- struct metal_device: Needed to resolve the type and layout of dev so you can find the bus member and follow how the dev_dma_map pointer is obtained.\\n- struct metal_bus: Required to resolve the bus field type and how ops are populated.\\n- struct metal_bus_ops (declaration of dev_dma_map prototype): To know the dev_dma_map prototype (parameter types) and find all implementations with matching signatures for analysis.\\n- struct metal_sg: The scatter/gather structures passed into dev_dma_map may contain pointers/lengths; inspect their fields to determine whether char* or string buffers are being passed to functions that might call memcmp.\\n- memcmp (standard library function): You must find all direct uses of memcmp to check whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings (the MISRA violation target).\\n- Any project wrapper or alias for memcmp (e.g. metal_memcmp, bcmp, memcmp_s): Projects sometimes wrap or alias memcmp; include these so no memcmp usage is missed.\\n- All call targets reachable from dev_dma_map implementations that may call memcmp: dev_dma_map implementations may call other helpers; include those reachable functions so memcmp usage in the transitive call graph is examined.\\n\\nThese symbols let the next analyst (or tool) locate the code paths that actually perform comparisons and determine whether memcmp is (incorrectly) used on null\u2011terminated strings."
