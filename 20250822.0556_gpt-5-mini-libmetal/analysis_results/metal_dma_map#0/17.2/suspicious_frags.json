  "explanation": "There is no direct call to metal_dma_map within its own body (no explicit metal_dma_map(...) invocation), so direct recursion is not present. The only potential recursion path is via the function-pointer dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map: its declaration and the runtime call site are the relevant locations to inspect because an implementation of that bus operation could (intentionally or accidentally) call back into metal_dma_map, creating indirect recursion. Other code in the function (null checks, atomic_thread_fence calls, local variable use, and return of nents_out) cannot introduce self-calls. The other members of struct metal_bus_ops shown have different signatures (and thus cannot be the same function pointer as dev_dma_map without a type mismatch), so they are not relevant to Rule 17.2 in this context. Therefore only the dev_dma_map function-pointer declaration and its null-check and invocation sites need further investigation for possible indirect recursion."
