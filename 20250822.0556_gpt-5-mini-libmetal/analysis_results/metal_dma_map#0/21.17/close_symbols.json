  "explanation": "You must be able to inspect anything that might call or pass buffers to the standard string functions in <string.h>. Explanations for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_device: metal_dma_map dereferences dev and uses dev->bus. You need the struct layout to see what dev->bus points to and to trace any buffer pointers or metadata stored in the device struct that could affect memory accesses.\n\n- struct metal_bus: contains the ops pointer passed as the first argument to the dev_dma_map implementation. Its layout is needed to resolve the ops pointer and any bus-level state that the implementation may use when manipulating buffers.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops: defines the dev_dma_map function pointer type and prototype. You need this to know the exact signature and how sg_in, nents_in and sg_out are forwarded (types and constness) so you can trace buffer sizes/ownership into the implementation.\n\n- dev_dma_map (the function pointer in struct metal_bus_ops) \u2014 all concrete implementations in the codebase: The target function does not itself call any string.h routines, but it calls dev_dma_map on the bus ops. Any violation of the MISRA string handling rule would occur in those implementations (or functions they call). You must inspect the actual implementations to see whether they call memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/etc and whether those calls can access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by the passed pointers.\n\n- struct metal_sg: scatter/gather descriptors are the buffer descriptors passed to dev_dma_map (sg_in and sg_out). You need their fields (addresses, lengths, virtual pointers, flags) to determine actual buffer extents, and to verify that any string.h calls in the called implementations use lengths/offsets that are within those extents.\n\n- semantics/contract of nents_in and nents_out: the meaning and valid ranges of these counts (how many sg entries are valid, whether zero is allowed, whether the callee may return a different count) are required to determine whether indexing or copies performed in the implementations can go out of bounds.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: used to select memory fences. Include to fully understand control flow; not directly related to string.h usage but needed for complete flow analysis.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel: included to show the memory\u2011fence calls invoked by the target function. These are standard atomic operations (not string functions) and should be checked/known to not invoke string.h routines; include them so the analyzer can rule them out as sources of string.h usage.\n\nNotes: The key items you must inspect to determine MISRA string-function violations are the dev_dma_map implementations and the metal_sg layout/semantics (and nents semantics). The other symbols are included to resolve call targets and control flow so the analyzer can trace any potential memcpy/memmove/etc usage and verify bounds."
