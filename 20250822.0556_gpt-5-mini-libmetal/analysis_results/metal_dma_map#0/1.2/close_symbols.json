  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any language/compiler extensions we must inspect the definitions and declarations it relies on (they themselves might contain compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, inline asm, typeof, compiler builtins, nonstandard calling conventions, anonymous/implementation-defined language features, or macros that expand to compiler builtins). For each symbol: \n\n- struct metal_device: contains the 'bus' member and may carry attributes, bitfields, anonymous unions/structs, or nonstandard annotations; its definition must be checked for extensions.\n- struct metal_bus: the type of dev->bus; its definition may use extensions (e.g., anonymous structs/unions, compiler attributes) and is needed to resolve bus->ops.\n- struct metal_bus_ops: contains the dev_dma_map member (function pointer) \u2014 inspect for nonstandard function pointer types, calling conventions, attributes or other extensions in its declaration.\n- dev_dma_map (the dev_dma_map function-pointer declaration/type): the exact prototype may include extensions (attributes, varargs, unusual parameter types); need its declaration to see if any language extensions are used when the pointer is invoked.\n- struct metal_sg: the scatter/gather type passed in/out \u2014 its definition could use extensions (flexible array members with nonstandard annotations, anonymous unions, attributes) so must be inspected.\n- uint32_t: to verify it is the standard typedef (from <stdint.h>) and not a compiler-specific alias or macro.\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: macro/enum controlling atomic fence behavior \u2014 inspect its definition to ensure it is a plain macro/enum and does not expand to compiler-specific constructs.\n- atomic_thread_fence: declaration/macro may map to C11 stdatomic or to a compiler builtin or extension (e.g., __atomic_thread_fence); need to see exact definition to decide if a language extension is used.\n- memory_order_release: (and memory_order_acq_rel) these are named constants/types associated with atomic_thread_fence; their definitions (enum/macros) must be checked to ensure they are standard C11 or are compiler-specific.\n- memory_order_acq_rel: same reason as memory_order_release.\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: errno macros; need to ensure they are normal errno macros and not redefined via compiler-specific constructs in the project headers.\n- <stdatomic.h>, <stdint.h>, <errno.h>: the actual headers (or project equivalents) that provide atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_*, uint32_t and errno macros \u2014 the headers must be inspected because project-local headers with the same names might introduce compiler-specific extensions or macros that map to compiler builtins.\n\nInspecting these symbols/headers lets the analyzer determine whether any used identifiers expand to or depend on language/compiler-specific extensions (attributes, builtins, inline asm, compiler-specific keywords), which is required to decide compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding language extensions."
