  "explanation": "I found no explicit compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific identifiers (for example __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __volatile__ in non-standard form, or gcc/clang-specific keywords) are present.\n- No inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, or other known vendor extensions are used.\n- The atomic_thread_fence and the memory_order_* identifiers are the standard C11 atomic facilities (stdatomic.h); these are language-standard features rather than compiler extensions. If your toolchain documents stdatomic as an extension, then those lines should be re-examined, but there is no explicit compiler-specific syntax here.\n- Standard C99/C11 items such as uint32_t, function-pointer members in structs, and normal struct definitions are used; these are standard, not extensions.\n- No use of zero-length arrays, flexible array members beyond standard C99, or other non-standard constructs was observed.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that meet the criterion \u201cexplicitly stated as a compiler language extension\u201d to report. If you want, I can re-evaluate for a specific compiler (e.g. older GCC, IAR, Keil) to check whether any of these standard features are documented as extensions or unsupported in that toolchain."
