  "explanation": "For assessing whether any controlling expression in metal_dma_map is invariant you must know the types, qualifiers and definitions of the external symbols used in those expressions and any fields that could make them constant:\n\n- struct metal_device: needed to see the declaration of the 'bus' member and any const/volatile qualification that affects whether dev->bus (and therefore expressions involving dev) can change. If bus or members are const/immutable, checks against them might be invariant.\n\n- struct metal_bus: required to inspect the 'ops' member type and qualifiers; whether bus->ops can change at runtime affects whether dev->bus->ops is an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops: required to determine the type and qualifiers of the dev_dma_map member (e.g. function-pointer type, const/volatile). If dev_dma_map is a compile-time constant (e.g. static const table) the check !dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map could be invariant.\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map (the function-pointer member): while implied by the structs, explicitly consider its semantics (is it a writable pointer settable at runtime or a fixed dispatch table?). This directly affects whether the controlling test \"if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map)\" can be invariant.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: the comparator constant used in \"dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R\"; you must know its value/type to determine whether the comparison can be a compile-time/invariant expression or whether it depends on mutable inputs.\n\n- uint32_t (definition of dir): knowing dir's type and whether it may be declared with qualifiers (e.g. const or volatile) elsewhere matters for detecting invariance of the dir comparison.\n\n- struct metal_sg: the sg_in/sg_out parameter types and any qualifiers (const/volatile) could influence whether null checks or other uses are invariant; include to confirm these parameters are ordinary runtime inputs.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: the prototype/semantics are needed only to confirm that the calls have no effect on the controlling expressions' mutability, and to check whether they imply any required memory/volatile semantics that could affect invariance reasoning.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: their definitions (enum/macros) are needed to understand the semantics of the chosen fences; this helps decide if the conditional fence selection based on dir is meaningful at runtime (i.e. whether dir-driven branching is expected to vary) and to ensure fence-related side-effects aren't being mistaken for changes to controlling expressions.\n\nNote: errno macros (EINVAL/ENODEV) and the implementation of dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map (the function body) are not required to determine whether the controlling expressions themselves are invariant, though the implementation of dev_dma_map could be examined separately for related issues."
