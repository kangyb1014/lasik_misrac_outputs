  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters int irq_base and int irq_num are only read and never assigned to. All modifications are made to local variables (irq_tocheck, irq_end_tocheck, cntr_irq_base, cntr_irq_end), which is permitted. There are no pointer parameters whose pointer value could be modified. The macros used (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of) and the constant METAL_IRQ_ANY are only used in read/compare contexts and do not assign to the function parameters. Therefore there are no places that need investigation under Rule 17.8."
