  "explanation": "Only non-const pointer uses are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The fragments above declare or use pointers to struct types without const qualification (or pass such pointers to macros) and therefore should be investigated to determine whether they could point to const-qualified types. Other parts of the function are integer variables, arithmetic, control flow, comparisons, or return statements (e.g. irq_tocheck, irq_end_tocheck, cntr_irq_base, cntr_irq_end, the if/return statements), which are not pointer declarations or pointer uses that can be made const-qualified, so they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
