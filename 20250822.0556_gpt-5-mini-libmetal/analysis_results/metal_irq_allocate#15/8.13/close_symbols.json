  "explanation": "To decide whether the local pointers in metal_irq_allocate should point to const-qualified types, the analyzer must know how those pointers are used and how they interact with list/container utilities:\n\n- struct metal_list (definition): required to see the actual element/member types accessed by iteration and whether any list members are modified. Determines whether a pointer-to-struct-metal_list could safely be const-qualified.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition): required to know the member types (irq_base, irq_num, node) and to check whether the function modifies any members (which would prevent using pointer-to-const). Also needed to know the type/layout for container_of correctness.\n\n- irq_cntrs (declaration/definition of the global list head): required to see its declared type/const-qualification and how it is passed to the iterator (metal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs,...)). The head's type can affect whether iteration requires non-const pointers.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro or inline definition): required because it expands/implements the iteration pattern and performs assignments to the 'node' variable. The expansion determines whether 'node' can be declared as 'const struct metal_list *' (assigning a non-const struct metal_list* into a pointer-to-const is allowed) and whether the macro takes/produces non-const pointers elsewhere.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro or inline definition): this macro typically computes the container pointer from a member pointer and may cast to a non-const container pointer. Its expansion shows whether const qualifiers are preserved or stripped, and whether assigning its result to a pointer-to-const is safe.\n\n(These symbols are sufficient to determine if the pointers 'node' and 'cntr' could be changed to point-to-const without violating usage or macro/type compatibility. Other symbols such as METAL_IRQ_ANY are irrelevant to pointer const-qualification.)"
