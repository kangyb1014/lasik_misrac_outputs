  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check for violations of the <string.h> bounds rule\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ANY\n  - The function tests for and returns this sentinel value. Knowing its type and numeric value is required to ensure it is not a pointer or alias to an object that could participate in any string.h call or pointer arithmetic that might access out-of-bounds memory.\n\n- irq_cntrs (global list head)\n  - The for-each iteration operates over this list. Its precise type/definition is needed to inspect the iterator implementation (metal_list_for_each) and ensure no hidden string.h calls or pointer casts (to char*, etc.) are performed while walking the list.\n\n- struct metal_list\n  - metal_list_for_each and metal_container_of operate on this node type. The struct definition lets you determine whether node fields are pointers to character buffers or include other members that might be used by string functions elsewhere (and whether any pointer arithmetic in macros could be unsafe).\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro or function)\n  - This iteration primitive must be inspected to confirm it does not call any of the standard string functions or perform pointer arithmetic or casts that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. The target function uses it directly, so its implementation is essential.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro)\n  - This macro translates a struct metal_list pointer to its enclosing struct metal_irq_controller. Its definition (usually using offsetof and pointer casts) must be checked to ensure the pointer arithmetic is valid and does not cause undefined behavior or trigger accesses that would be relevant to the string.h rule.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller\n  - The function reads cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num. The types and layout of this struct must be known to ensure those fields are plain integers (not pointers to buffers) and to confirm container_of usage is safe; if the struct contained embedded character arrays or pointer fields used elsewhere with string.h functions, that would be relevant.\n\n- offsetof\n  - Because container_of typically uses offsetof from <stddef.h>, the definition/usage should be checked to ensure the macro is used in the standard, safe way (no non-portable pointer casts) and does not contribute to any out-of-bounds accesses that could be confused with string.h violations.\n\nNote: The target function contains no direct calls to string.h functions. The listed symbols are the minimal set required to confirm that none of the macros/struct manipulations used by this function (or their implementations) indirectly invoke or enable unsafe use of string.h routines or pointer arithmetic that could access memory out of bounds."
