  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_io_block_set violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion you must inspect every possible call path that could loop back to metal_io_block_set. Specifically:\n\n- metal_io_virt: metal_io_block_set directly calls this; its body must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_io_block_set.\n- metal_io_block_read, metal_io_block_write, shmem_child: these are known callers of metal_io_virt (from the static graph). Any of these could participate in a call cycle back to metal_io_block_set, so their definitions must be inspected.\n- io->ops.block_set (function pointer): metal_io_block_set may call through this pointer. The pointer target(s) could call back into metal_io_block_set, so the function pointer and its possible targets must be resolved.\n- all concrete implementations assigned to io->ops.block_set: you must examine each implementation (functions assigned to that pointer) to see whether they call metal_io_block_set (directly or via other functions).\n- any callers of metal_io_block_set (transitive caller set): to detect indirect recursion you need to know who calls metal_io_block_set and whether those callers (or their callees) eventually call metal_io_block_set again.\n- transitive callees of the above functions (their call chains): indirect recursion can occur through multiple levels; therefore inspect the full transitive callee sets of metal_io_virt, the callers listed above, and block_set implementations.\n- initializers/constructors that set up io->ops: to find the concrete block_set targets you must locate where io->ops is initialized (global/static init, constructors, or runtime assignment).\n\nCollecting and analyzing the bodies of these symbols (and their transitive call relationships) lets you prove absence of any call cycle that includes metal_io_block_set, or find an indirect recursion if one exists."
