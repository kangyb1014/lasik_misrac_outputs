  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. The initializer int retlen = len; is an initialization at the point of declaration. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2's Note 3 explicitly states that initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therefore not a candidate for dead code. Although the value is overwritten later before any use when ptr != NULL (and the function returns early when ptr == NULL), that redundancy is an initializer and so does not fall under Rule 2.2. Therefore the reported violation is not correct. (Separately, the initializer could be removed as a code-quality change, but it does not constitute a MISRA Rule 2.2 violation.)"
