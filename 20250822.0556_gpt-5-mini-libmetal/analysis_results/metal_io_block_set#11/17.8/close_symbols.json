  "explanation": "1) metal_io_virt (prototype): We must confirm the parameter types and return type of metal_io_virt to ensure that calling it cannot implicitly modify any of metal_io_block_set's parameters (for example, by taking them by address). If metal_io_virt took pointer-to-pointer or used non-obvious side-effects via macros, that could affect whether parameters are modified. The prototype also confirms the returned pointer type and helps ensure ptr is a local copy, not an alias that would represent a reassignment of a parameter.\n\n2) struct metal_io_region (definition): The function dereferences io (io->size and io->ops). We need the struct layout to verify that these are ordinary data members (not macros or accessor functions that could perform assignments to the parameter). Knowing the type also confirms that io is indeed a pointer parameter and that modifications to *io (allowed by MISRA) are distinguishable from modifications to the parameter variable io itself (which would be a violation if the code assigned to io).\n\n3) type/definition of io->ops (e.g. struct metal_io_ops) including the block_set member signature: The code tests io->ops.block_set and calls it. We need the exact type/signature of block_set to confirm it is a function pointer taking its arguments by value (so the call cannot modify caller parameters like offset/len/value) rather than taking pointers/references that could modify caller variables. Also the ops structure definition rules out macros or indirect assignments that could rebind the parameter variables.\\\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any of the function's parameters (io, offset, value, len) are modified directly in this function or indirectly via called APIs/ops. Other symbols visible in the body (CHAR_BIT, atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_seq_cst, ERANGE, uintptr_t) do not affect whether a function parameter variable is assigned to, so they are not required to assess this specific MISRA rule."
