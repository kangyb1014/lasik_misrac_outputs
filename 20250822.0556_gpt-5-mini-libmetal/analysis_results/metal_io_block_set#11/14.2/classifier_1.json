  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_block_set:\n```c\nint metal_io_block_set(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       unsigned char value, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tint retlen = len;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_set) {\n\t\t(*io->ops.block_set)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, value, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\tunsigned int cint = value;\n\t\tunsigned int i;\n\n\t\tfor (i = 1; i < sizeof(int); i++)\n\t\t\tcint |= ((unsigned int)value << (CHAR_BIT * i));\n\n\t\tfor (; len && ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)); ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr = (unsigned char) value;\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = cint;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr = (unsigned char) value;\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (; len != 0; ptr++, len--)\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The iteration expression 'ptr++, len--' modifies two objects (ptr and len). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires a for-loop to have only one loop counter and the third clause shall modify only the loop counter. Modifying ptr in the third clause introduces a second loop counter/variable being incremented, so this loop is not well-formed under Rule 14.2."
