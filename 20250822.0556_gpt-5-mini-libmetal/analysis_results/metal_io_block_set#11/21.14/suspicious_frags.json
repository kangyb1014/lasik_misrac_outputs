  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function performs memory writes (block set) via an ops->block_set call or manual byte/int writes; it does not perform any comparisons of null\u2011terminated strings. There are no calls to strcmp/strncmp/memcmp or any code that treats byte sequences as C-style null-terminated strings for comparison. Therefore, there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (do not use memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings). Note: other potential issues (e.g., pointer alignment, type-punning, atomic fences) are outside the scope of Rule 21.14 and thus not flagged here."
