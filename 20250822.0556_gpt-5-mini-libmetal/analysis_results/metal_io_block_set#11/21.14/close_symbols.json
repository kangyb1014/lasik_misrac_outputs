  "explanation": "- metal_io_virt (implementation): metal_io_block_set directly calls metal_io_virt; we must inspect its body to ensure it does not call memcmp (directly or via wrappers) or otherwise perform string comparisons that would violate the MISRA rule.\n- struct metal_io_region (definition): needed to understand the types of io->ops and the semantics of io->size/ptr; also to locate the ops field so we can determine the type/name of the block_set pointer and where implementations are registered.\n- metal_io_ops / ops.block_set (type and prototype): the block_set pointer is invoked from metal_io_block_set. We need the prototype to know what functions can be assigned and to locate all implementations to inspect whether any implementation uses memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- All concrete implementations assigned to io->ops.block_set (each function): any implementation called through the function pointer is effectively a callee of metal_io_block_set; each must be examined for uses of memcmp comparing null\u2011terminated strings (the MISRA violation could be indirect via these implementations).\n- memcmp (standard library symbol): include the symbol so the analyzer can detect direct uses of memcmp in the codebase and verify whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in any of the above symbols.\n- Any project-level wrappers or aliases for memcmp (e.g. custom_memcmp, bcmp, or macro aliases): projects sometimes wrap or alias memcmp; these wrappers must be checked as they are semantically equivalent and could violate the rule.\n- Any functions in the repository that call memcmp (call-sites): a repository-wide list of memcmp call-sites helps quickly determine whether any of the callee candidates (metal_io_virt or block_set implementations) perform string comparisons via memcmp.\n\nRationale: metal_io_block_set itself does not call memcmp, but it calls metal_io_virt and may call io->ops.block_set through a function pointer. To prove absence (or presence) of the MISRA violation you must inspect those reachable symbols and any uses of memcmp (or wrappers) within them. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether memcmp is used (directly or indirectly) to compare null\u2011terminated strings in the execution paths involving metal_io_block_set."
