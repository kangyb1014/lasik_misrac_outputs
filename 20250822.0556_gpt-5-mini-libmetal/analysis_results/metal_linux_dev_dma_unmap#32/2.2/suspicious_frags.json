  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The snippet contains only the function definition and the three executable statements shown above (two local initializations and a single call). There are no other statements, conditionals, loops, labels, or unreachable code in the snippet to inspect. Initialization rules (note 3) and purely syntactic elements (braces, parameter list) are not candidates for dead code. Therefore no additional fragments outside the listed ones exist in this snippet that would be relevant to a Rule 2.2 (dead code) investigation."
