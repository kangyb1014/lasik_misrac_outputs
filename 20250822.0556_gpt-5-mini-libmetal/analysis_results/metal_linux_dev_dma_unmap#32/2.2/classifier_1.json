  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap:\n```c\nstatic void metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t      uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t      int nents)\n{\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\n\tldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(lbus, ldev, dir, sg,\n\t\t\t\t       nents);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local pointer ldev is initialized and immediately used in the subsequent call ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(...). Removing the assignment (or the call to to_linux_device) would change program behaviour, so this is not dead code. (Only if the result were never used or if to_linux_device had no observable side effects would it be dead, which is not the case here.)"
