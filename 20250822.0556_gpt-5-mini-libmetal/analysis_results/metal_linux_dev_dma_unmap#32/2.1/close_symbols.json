  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) you must know every place it could be invoked. Listing and examining: 1) all direct call-sites and any function-pointer assignments referencing metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap is required because an otherwise-absent direct caller can still exist through assignment into an ops table or struct initializer; such assignments make the function reachable at runtime. 2) The bus ops struct (the ops table) is the usual container for device callbacks; you must inspect that symbol to see whether this function is placed there. 3) The bus registration/initialization code is needed because even if the ops table contains a pointer to this function, the function is only reachable if that ops table is actually installed/registered with the metal framework. 4\u20135) to_linux_device and to_linux_bus implementations are needed to check whether the function body contains code paths that are, by construction, never taken (for example if these macros/functions expand/compile-out code or trigger early returns) \u2014 they also affect whether the function can complete normally. 6\u20138) The struct definitions for linux_device, linux_bus and the linux driver (ldrv) + the dev_dma_unmap function-pointer member are necessary to understand whether any part of the single statement in the function is compiled out, conditional, or otherwise impossible to execute (for example, if ldrv is a macro that makes the call conditional or if dev_dma_unmap is defined in such a way that the call cannot occur). In short: to prove the target function is reachable you must find every reference to it (direct calls and function-pointer registrations) and inspect the surrounding registration/struct code and the callee implementations used inside the function."
