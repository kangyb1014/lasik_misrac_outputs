  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in the provided snippets that are syntactically or semantically unreachable. The function metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap contains a straight-line sequence of statements (local pointer initializations followed by a single function-pointer invocation) with no conditional compilation, unconditional goto, return before the end, infinite loop, or any code after a return/exit that would be impossible to reach. The helper functions to_linux_device and to_linux_bus are simple container_of wrappers that return pointers (no unreachable code inside). The struct linux_bus is a data declaration (no executable statements) and therefore cannot contain unreachable executable code. There are no switch statements, multiple case labels, fall-through branches, dead branches, or other constructs in the supplied fragments that could produce unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Consequently, nothing in the provided code needs further investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
