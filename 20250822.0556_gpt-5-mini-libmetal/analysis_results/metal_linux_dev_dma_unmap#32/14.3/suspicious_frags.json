  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions (in for, while, do-while, if, switch, ?:, etc.). The provided function contains no loops, conditional statements, or other controlling expressions\u2014only local variable declarations and a single function call. Therefore there are no controlling expressions to be investigated for invariance in this fragment. Any potential issues inside ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap cannot be assessed from this code snippet and are out of scope."
