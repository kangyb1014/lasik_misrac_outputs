  "explanation": "to_linux_device: the conversion may be a macro or inline function; its body must be inspected to ensure it contains no controlling statements with invariant expressions. to_linux_bus: same reason as above for the bus conversion. struct linux_device: required to identify the ldrv member and confirm whether accessing ldev->ldrv could involve any hidden control constructs (e.g. accessor macros). type of ldev->ldrv (e.g. struct linux_driver): needed to see the type that holds dev_dma_unmap so we can locate the member declaration. dev_dma_unmap member prototype/definition: although the call here is a simple function-pointer invocation, the implementation (or the function-pointer type if it is a macro) might contain loops or conditionals with invariant controlling expressions \u2014 those must be examined. struct linux_bus: included to inspect any conversion or accessor behavior and to ensure no control expressions arise from its use. definitions of any macros used by to_linux_device/to_linux_bus (e.g. container_of or casting macros): macros can expand to control flow; they must be checked for invariant controlling expressions. struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: the conversion helpers (to_linux_*) may rely on these definitions (or on their contained fields) \u2014 include them to fully understand the conversions and rule out hidden control expressions."
