  "scenario": "Not violated in the normal/expected design: metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap calls a driver callback via ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap, which is a different function pointer. This does not itself constitute direct or indirect self-call. A concrete violation scenario would be if the driver callback pointer were (mistakenly) set to point back to metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap (or if there were a cycle of function-pointer calls that eventually re-entered metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap). In that misconfiguration (e.g. ldrv->dev_dma_unmap = metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap), an indirect recursion would occur and Rule 17.2 would be violated."
