  "explanation": "No parameter is modified in the provided code. The function metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap only reads its parameters to compute local pointers (via to_linux_device/to_linux_bus) and to pass them to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap. There are no assignments to any parameter variables, no increment/decrement operations, and no reassignments of pointer parameters (bus, device, sg) or value parameters (dir, nents). The helper functions shown (to_linux_device, to_linux_bus) return derived pointers but do not modify their pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
