Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol: \n- to_linux_device: The target function calls this function; any for-loops inside it contribute to the behaviour executed at the call site and must be checked against the MISRA for-loop requirements. \n- to_linux_bus: Same reason as to_linux_device \u2014 it is invoked inside the target function and its body may contain for-loops that must be analyzed. \n- struct linux_device: Needed to resolve the ldev->ldrv member (the driver pointer) and therefore determine the function-pointer field and its type; also to find any inline code or macros in the type that might contain for-loops. \n- struct linux_bus: Needed to understand how lbus is formed and whether its type contains code (inline or macros) or members that affect loops in called functions. \n- type/definition of ldev->ldrv (driver structure): Required to identify the dev_dma_unmap member (function pointer) and to find what function implementations may be invoked. Knowing the exact member type is necessary to locate implementations and inspect them for for-loops. \n- ldrv->dev_dma_unmap (declaration / function-pointer type): The call through this pointer is executed in the target function. The MISRA rule treats behaviour of called functions as part of the call site, so the pointer declaration and signature are needed to locate and analyze the called code. \n- All concrete implementations/targets assigned to ldrv->dev_dma_unmap (function definitions): Each concrete function that can be called via the dev_dma_unmap pointer must be inspected for any for-loops and whether those loops comply with the MISRA clauses (including loops in their bodies and any functions they call). \n- All functions called (callees) by the dev_dma_unmap implementations (transitive callees): MISRA treats behaviour of any functions invoked within a for-loop body as part of the loop\u2019s behaviour. Therefore, any functions called by dev_dma_unmap implementations must also be inspected for for-loops or for modifications of loop counters/control flags.\n\nIn short: because the target function invokes other functions (two direct helpers and an indirect driver callback), the analysis must include the implementations and transitive callees of those functions plus the type definitions needed to resolve the indirect call target(s) to determine whether any for-loops executed as part of the target function violate the MISRA well-formed for-loop rule."
