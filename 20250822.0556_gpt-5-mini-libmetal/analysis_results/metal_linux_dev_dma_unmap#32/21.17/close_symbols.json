  "explanation": "to_linux_device \u2014 the conversion may be a macro/inline that performs pointer arithmetic or returns pointers used later; inspect to ensure it doesn't call any <string.h> functions or produce out-of-bounds pointers.\n\nto_linux_bus \u2014 same reason as to_linux_device; conversion code could use string functions or produce invalid pointers.\n\nstruct linux_device \u2014 required to know the type/layout of ldev, particularly the ldrv field and how the device pointer is derived; also to see if any embedded char arrays are exposed and could be subject to string ops.\n\nstruct linux_bus \u2014 required to know what is passed to the driver callback and whether the bus object contains buffers or strings that might be accessed by string functions.\n\ntype of linux_device::ldrv (e.g., struct linux_driver) \u2014 to find the driver callback table/type that contains dev_dma_unmap; needed to follow the indirect call.\n\ndeclaration/prototype of dev_dma_unmap function pointer (signature) \u2014 to verify parameter types and ensure correct forwarding (sizes/lengths) and to locate implementations.\n\nAll concrete implementations assigned to ldrv->dev_dma_unmap (driver callback functions) \u2014 the target function forwards the call; any use of string.h that could access out-of-bounds memory will be in these implementations. They must be inspected to determine MISRA <string.h> violations.\n\nstruct metal_bus, struct metal_device, struct metal_sg \u2014 definitions of the argument types forwarded into the callback are needed to check whether the driver implementations operate on these objects and may call string functions on their members.\n\ndefinitions/implementations of to_linux_device/to_linux_bus if they are macros or inline functions \u2014 if these are macros/inline they must be examined (they are part of the target\u2019s behavior) to ensure no hidden string.h use or pointer arithmetic that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses."
