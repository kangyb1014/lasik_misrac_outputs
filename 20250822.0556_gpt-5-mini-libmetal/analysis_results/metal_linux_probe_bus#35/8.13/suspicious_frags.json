  "explanation": "I flagged all occurrences of pointer types and pointer uses in the function for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (places where a pointer could potentially be const-qualified). I did not include non-pointer identifiers (ret, error) or simple control-flow constructs (for/if/return/comment) because they are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. I also did not omit any pointer expressions found in the provided code: all parameter, local pointer declarations, member-pointer accesses, and addresses-of members passed to functions are listed above for review. Pointers that are clearly being written to (e.g. assigning lbus->sbus) or whose mutability is evident should be verified but were still included so the reviewers can confirm whether const qualification is appropriate in context."
