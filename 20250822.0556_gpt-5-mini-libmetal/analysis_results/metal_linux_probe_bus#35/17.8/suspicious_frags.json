  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically:\n- The only write to the object referred to by the pointer parameter is lbus->sbus = sysfs_open_bus(lbus->bus_name); modifying a member of the object pointed to by lbus is allowed by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified).\n- There is no assignment to the parameter identifier lbus itself (no statements like lbus = ...), so the pointer parameter is not modified.\n- Passing lbus (or &lbus->bus) to other functions (metal_linux_probe_driver, metal_linux_bus_close, metal_linux_register_bus) is not a modification of the parameter within this function; such calls may modify the pointed object but that is permitted.\n- The for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) usage and reads of lbus->bus_name are read operations and do not reassign the parameter.\nTherefore no code fragments in this function violate Rule 17.8 and no further investigation is required for this rule."
