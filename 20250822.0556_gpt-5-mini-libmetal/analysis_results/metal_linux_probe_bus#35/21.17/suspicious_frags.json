  "explanation": "No direct calls to the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) or any explicit buffer copy/concatenation operations appear in this snippet. The remaining code consists of variable declarations, simple assignments, control flow (for_each_linux_driver loop and if checks), null pointer test, and returns \u2014 none of which by themselves invoke string handling or perform pointer arithmetic that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. The four selected call sites should be investigated because they pass pointers/structures into other functions (not shown here) which might use string.h routines; all other fragments in this snippet do not warrant investigation for Rule 21.17."
