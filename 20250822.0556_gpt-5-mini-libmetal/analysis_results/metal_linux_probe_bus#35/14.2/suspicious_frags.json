  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the for-loop and the identifiers it uses are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The macro-based loop (for_each_linux_driver) and the loop counter declaration (ldrv) must be inspected in their expanded form to ensure the three for-clauses and the single loop-counter rules are satisfied. The statements inside the loop that call metal_linux_probe_driver and modify 'error' are included because they may produce side effects or modify objects referenced in the for-clause(s) when the macro is expanded. Other fragments in the function are not relevant to Rule 14.2: the sysfs_open_bus call and its null check, the final check of 'error' and calls to metal_linux_bus_close/metal_linux_register_bus, the initializations of 'ret' and 'error', and the return statements do not form for-statements nor affect the well-formedness of a for loop, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
