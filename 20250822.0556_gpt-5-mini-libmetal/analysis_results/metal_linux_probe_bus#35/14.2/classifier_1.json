  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_probe_bus:\n```c\nstatic int metal_linux_probe_bus(struct linux_bus *lbus)\n{\n\tstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n\tint ret, error = -ENODEV;\n\n\tlbus->sbus = sysfs_open_bus(lbus->bus_name);\n\tif (!lbus->sbus)\n\t\treturn -ENODEV;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) {\n\t\tret = metal_linux_probe_driver(lbus, ldrv);\n\t\t/* Clear the error if any driver is available */\n\t\tif (!ret)\n\t\t\terror = ret;\n\t}\n\n\tif (error) {\n\t\tmetal_linux_bus_close(&lbus->bus);\n\t\treturn error;\n\t}\n\n\terror = metal_linux_register_bus(lbus);\n\tif (error)\n\t\tmetal_linux_bus_close(&lbus->bus);\n\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n/* Clear the error if any driver is available */\n\t\tif (!ret)\n\t\t\terror = ret;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for the code as shown: the assignment \"error = ret;\" modifies the variable error, which is not the loop counter and (given a normal for_each_linux_driver expansion) is not used in the for-loop second clause or the loop header. Therefore the fragment does not breach Rule 14.2. (Note: if the for_each_linux_driver macro expanded to a for-header that used \"error\" or \"ret\" in its second clause or as the loop counter, then assigning to that object in the loop body would violate Rule 14.2.)"
