  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided snippets. The macro for_each_linux_bus(lbus) expands to a plain for loop (for ((lbus)=linux_bus; (lbus)->bus_name; (lbus)++)), which uses only standard C constructs (pointer initialization, pointer dereference, pointer increment and pointer used in a boolean context). The function metal_linux_bus_init, the struct linux_bus fields (array and pointer members) and the use of the -ENODEV macro are all standard C usages and are not compiler extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, statement expressions ({...}), typeof, nested functions, __builtin_* functions, label-as-value, or other vendor-specific keywords appear). Therefore there are no fragments here that, by themselves, require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Note: if linux_bus or other symbols not shown are defined elsewhere with compiler-specific attributes or extensions, those definitions would need review, but they are not present in the supplied code."
