Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining text in the function consists only of syntactic braces and whitespace, which are not executable code and therefore not candidates for dead-code investigation. There is no other code (e.g. additional statements, unreachable code following a return, or separate helper functions) in the provided fragment to analyze. The included fragments cover the function declaration, the local declarations, the iteration macro, the probe/accumulation expression, and the return expression \u2014 these are the elements that could exhibit dead-code issues (unused/never-updated variables, loop/body that never executes due to macro expansion, or a return that is constant at compile/link time). No other parts of the snippet warrant investigation for Rule 2.2."
