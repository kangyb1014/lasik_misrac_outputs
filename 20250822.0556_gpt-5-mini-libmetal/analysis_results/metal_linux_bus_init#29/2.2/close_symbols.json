  "explanation": "for_each_linux_bus (macro/iterator): Needed to know how the loop is executed (iteration semantics, early exits, side effects in the macro). If the macro expands to nothing or a no-op the loop body may be dead; if it manipulates state the behaviour changes.\n\nlinux bus list head / iterator variables: The concrete symbol(s) that for_each_linux_bus traverses (list head, next-pointer field, etc.) are required to determine whether the loop actually iterates at runtime and whether iteration has side effects.\n\nstruct linux_bus (type definition): The structure layout may indicate embedded side-effecting members or be used by the probe function; its definition is needed to understand what data is being probed/registered and whether removing operations would change program state.\n\nmetal_linux_probe_bus (implementation): The target function calls this directly and sums its boolean result. To judge whether those calls are dead (i.e., their removal would not affect behaviour) we must see whether probe_bus has side effects (registering buses, touching global state, I/O) or is a pure query.\n\nmetal_linux_probe_driver, metal_linux_bus_close, metal_linux_register_bus (implementations): These are direct callees of metal_linux_probe_bus per the call graph. If probe_bus delegates side effects to these functions (register/unregister/driver probing), their implementations are required to determine whether the calls inside the loop have observable effects.\n\nlinux_bus registration/creation routines (functions that populate the for_each_linux_bus list): To know whether the loop will ever execute (or how many iterations) and whether removing the loop body changes system state, we need the code that creates and registers linux_bus instances (i.e. the producers of the iterated container).\n\nmetal_sys_init and metal_init (implementations): The call graph shows metal_linux_bus_init is called from metal_sys_init which is called from metal_init. To determine whether the target function is actually executed in normal startup (relevant to reachability and whether operations are executed at all), the callers' implementations and invocation conditions must be examined.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (a) whether the loop in metal_linux_bus_init is executed at runtime, (b) whether the calls in the loop produce observable side effects, and therefore (c) whether the operations in metal_linux_bus_init are executed but removable without changing program behaviour (i.e. dead code) per the MISRA rule."
