  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_bus_init:\n```c\nint metal_linux_bus_init(void)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus;\n\tint valid = 0;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_bus(lbus)\n\t\tvalid += metal_linux_probe_bus(lbus) ? 0 : 1;\n\n\treturn valid ? 0 : -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor_each_linux_bus(lbus)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The for_each_linux_bus(lbus) macro invokes metal_linux_probe_bus for each bus; removing the loop would change observable behaviour (probing and the function return value). The fragment is an executed control construct, not dead code. (Only if the macro expanded to a no-op under some build configuration would the loop body be removed \u2014 in that case those build conditions should be examined \u2014 but as shown, no dead code present.)"
