The lines selected contain the loop controlling construct (the macro invocation) and the two conditional expressions (the ? : operators). Other parts of the function are declarations, an initialization, and simple arithmetic/assignment expressions that are not controlling expressions and thus not relevant to rule 14.3; there are no other if/switch/while/do/for/conditional controlling expressions in this function to inspect."
