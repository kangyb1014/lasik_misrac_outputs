  "explanation": "To decide whether the for-loop controlling expression is invariant (MISRA: \u2018Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\u2019) we must inspect the actual loop control logic and any state it depends on, and whether that state can change inside the loop body. Specifically: \n\n- for_each_linux_bus: the rule applies to the loop controlling expression; the macro/function expansion reveals the exact controlling expression (e.g. pointer test, list iteration idiom, index bounds). Without the expansion we cannot tell if the expression is constant or changes each iteration.\n\n- global list/sentinel symbol(s): the controlling expression typically checks against a list head or sentinel. We must know which global object is used so we can reason about its mutability and whether it remains constant across iterations.\n\n- list_for_each_entry / list_for_each: if the macro delegates to standard list-iteration macros, their semantics (how they compute the next element and what they compare in the controlling expression) determine whether the loop terminates or uses an invariant expression.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_bus: the loop body calls this function. If it can modify the list/sentinel, remove or reinsert entries, or otherwise affect the iteration variables, that affects whether the controlling expression is invariant or changes during execution. We need the full body to see such side-effects.\n\n- metal_linux_bus_close and metal_linux_register_bus: these are known callees of metal_linux_probe_bus (from the call graph). They may add/remove entries from the bus list; their definitions are needed to track possible modifications to the container the loop iterates over.\n\n- struct linux_bus: the iteration macro and the probe function operate on struct linux_bus objects; the struct layout shows the linkage fields used by the iteration (e.g. list_head) and whether probe/close manipulate those fields, which can influence the loop control.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyst determine (a) what the loop's controlling expression actually is, (b) whether that expression is invariant by construction, and (c) whether any calls inside the loop can mutate the state that the controlling expression depends on, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
