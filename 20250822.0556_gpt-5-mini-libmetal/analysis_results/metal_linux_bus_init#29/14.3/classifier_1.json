  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the for_each_linux_bus(lbus) macro is expected to expand to a loop whose controlling expression depends on lbus (for example: for (lbus = first_bus; lbus != NULL; lbus = lbus->next)), so the controlling expression is not invariant and Rule 14.3 is not violated. (Note: a violation would occur if the macro expanded to an invariant control like for(;;) or a constant-condition for loop; such a definition would violate Rule 14.3 unless intended as an infinite loop exception.)"
