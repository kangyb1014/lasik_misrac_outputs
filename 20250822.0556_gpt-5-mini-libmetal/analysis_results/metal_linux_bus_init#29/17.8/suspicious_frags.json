  "explanation": "The function metal_linux_bus_init has no formal parameters (prototype uses void), so there are no parameters within this function that could be modified in violation of Rule 17.8. The local variables (lbus and valid) are allowed to be modified. The loop control and the return expression operate on local objects only. The only code locations that could involve modification of a function parameter are calls into external routines (the iteration macro and the probe call), which are therefore reported for further inspection. No other fragments in this function can violate Rule 17.8."
