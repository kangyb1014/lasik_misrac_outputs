True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIn the fragment, lbus is declared as 'struct linux_bus *lbus' and passed to metal_linux_probe_bus(lbus). If metal_linux_probe_bus treats the pointed-to object as read-only (i.e., does not modify the struct), then the pointer should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct linux_bus *lbus' and the function prototype should accept 'const struct linux_bus *'). Because the code shows a non-const pointer being used where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate, this violates Rule 8.13. (If, however, metal_linux_probe_bus legitimately modifies the object, no violation occurs \u2014 the fragment alone does not prove modification, so the violation is conditional on the function not modifying lbus.)\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\n\n=== metal_linux_bus_init start: Fri Aug 22 06:03:24 2025\nloop: lbus pointer = 0x7fcc18464b60\nmetal_linux_probe_bus(0x7fcc18464b60) returned 0\nafter iteration: valid = 1\nloop: lbus pointer = 0x7fcc18465dc8\nmetal_linux_probe_bus(0x7fcc18465dc8) returned 0\nafter iteration: valid = 2\nmetal_linux_bus_init end: valid = 2, returning 0\n\n=== metal_linux_bus_init start: Fri Aug 22 06:03:25 2025\nloop: lbus pointer = 0x5652e51d9260\nmetal_linux_probe_bus(0x5652e51d9260) returned 0\nafter iteration: valid = 1\nloop: lbus pointer = 0x5652e51da4c8\nmetal_linux_probe_bus(0x5652e51da4c8) returned 0\nafter iteration: valid = 2\nmetal_linux_bus_init end: valid = 2, returning 0\n\n</execution_log>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not proven by the fragment. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends using a pointer to const when the pointed object is not modified, but whether lbus can/should be const depends on the definitions and uses of for_each_linux_bus and metal_linux_probe_bus (and any other code that uses lbus). The supplied code and execution log show only that lbus addresses are passed to metal_linux_probe_bus and that it returns values \u2014 they do not show that the pointed-to struct is not modified, nor do they show the prototype of metal_linux_probe_bus. Therefore you cannot conclude a Rule 8.13 violation from this fragment alone. To establish a violation you would need to show that metal_linux_probe_bus (and other callees) do not modify the object and that their prototypes could accept a const struct linux_bus *; only then should lbus be declared as const struct linux_bus * (or the callee signatures changed)."
