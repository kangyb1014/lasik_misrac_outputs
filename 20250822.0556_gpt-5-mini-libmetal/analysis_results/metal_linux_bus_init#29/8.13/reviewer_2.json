If neither the for_each_linux_bus macro nor metal_linux_probe_bus require modifying the pointed-to object, then lbus should be declared as 'const struct linux_bus *lbus;' and the current declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not enough information to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 encourages making pointer-to-object types const where possible, but whether lbus should be declared as const depends on the types used by for_each_linux_bus and metal_linux_probe_bus. If metal_linux_probe_bus is declared to take a 'struct linux_bus *' (non-const) or the for_each_linux_bus macro relies on a non-const lbus, then the current non-const declaration is required and there is no violation. If both the iterator macro and metal_linux_probe_bus can work with 'const struct linux_bus *' then converting lbus to 'const struct linux_bus *' would be preferable and the current code would contravene the spirit of 8.13. The provided code and execution log do not show the prototype of metal_linux_probe_bus or the expansion/type expectations of for_each_linux_bus, so the agent A's claim cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone. Recommendation: inspect the declaration of metal_linux_probe_bus and the for_each_linux_bus macro; if both accept/produce const-qualified pointers, change lbus to 'const struct linux_bus *'."
