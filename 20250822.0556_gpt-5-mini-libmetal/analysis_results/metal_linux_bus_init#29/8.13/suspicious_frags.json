  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and whether they should be const-qualified when possible. The provided function contains only one pointer identifier (lbus); the declaration and its uses (iteration macro and the call site) are therefore the only fragments relevant to that rule. Other fragments are not relevant and need not be investigated: the function signature returns an int (not a pointer), the local integer 'valid' and its initialization are non-pointer scalar operations, and the final return expression involves only integer logic and an error code macro. These non-pointer parts cannot violate Rule 8.13, so they were not included."
