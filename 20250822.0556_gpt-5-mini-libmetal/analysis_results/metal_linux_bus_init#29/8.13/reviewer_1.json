In that case the pointer should be const-qualified ('const struct linux_bus *lbus;'), so the current code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, the for_each_linux_bus macro or metal_linux_probe_bus actually modifies the pointed-to linux_bus objects, then const qualification would not be appropriate and there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nENTER_BUS_LOOP: lbus=0x7f2a9dbf2b60\nAFTER_PROBE: lbus=0x7f2a9dbf2b60 probe_ret=0\n  diff[0]: 0x00 -> 0x30\n  diff[1]: 0x00 -> 0xc7\n  diff[2]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[3]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  diff[4]: 0x00 -> 0x2a\n  diff[5]: 0x00 -> 0x7f\n  diff[8]: 0x00 -> 0x09\n  diff[9]: 0x00 -> 0x4d\n  diff[10]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[11]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  diff[12]: 0x00 -> 0x2a\n  diff[13]: 0x00 -> 0x7f\n  diff[16]: 0x00 -> 0x9c\n  diff[17]: 0x00 -> 0x49\n  diff[18]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[19]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  snapshot: total differing bytes: 83 (showing up to 16)\nENTER_BUS_LOOP: lbus=0x7f2a9dbf3dc8\nAFTER_PROBE: lbus=0x7f2a9dbf3dc8 probe_ret=0\n  diff[0]: 0x00 -> 0x5d\n  diff[1]: 0x00 -> 0xc7\n  diff[2]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[3]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  diff[4]: 0x00 -> 0x2a\n  diff[5]: 0x00 -> 0x7f\n  diff[8]: 0x00 -> 0x09\n  diff[9]: 0x00 -> 0x4d\n  diff[10]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[11]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  diff[12]: 0x00 -> 0x2a\n  diff[13]: 0x00 -> 0x7f\n  diff[16]: 0x00 -> 0x9c\n  diff[17]: 0x00 -> 0x49\n  diff[18]: 0x00 -> 0xbe\n  diff[19]: 0x00 -> 0x9d\n  snapshot: total differing bytes: 82 (showing up to 16)\nEXIT_BUS_INIT: valid=2 return=0\nENTER_BUS_LOOP: lbus=0x561da0408260\nAFTER_PROBE: lbus=0x561da0408260 probe_ret=0\n  diff[0]: 0x00 -> 0x20\n  diff[1]: 0x00 -> 0x02\n  diff[2]: 0x00 -> 0x40\n  diff[3]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  diff[4]: 0x00 -> 0x1d\n  diff[5]: 0x00 -> 0x56\n  diff[8]: 0x00 -> 0x40\n  diff[9]: 0x00 -> 0xa7\n  diff[10]: 0x00 -> 0x3f\n  diff[11]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  diff[12]: 0x00 -> 0x1d\n  diff[13]: 0x00 -> 0x56\n  diff[16]: 0x00 -> 0xd3\n  diff[17]: 0x00 -> 0xa3\n  diff[18]: 0x00 -> 0x3f\n  diff[19]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  snapshot: total differing bytes: 83 (showing up to 16)\nENTER_BUS_LOOP: lbus=0x561da04094c8\nAFTER_PROBE: lbus=0x561da04094c8 probe_ret=0\n  diff[0]: 0x00 -> 0x4d\n  diff[1]: 0x00 -> 0x02\n  diff[2]: 0x00 -> 0x40\n  diff[3]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  diff[4]: 0x00 -> 0x1d\n  diff[5]: 0x00 -> 0x56\n  diff[8]: 0x00 -> 0x40\n  diff[9]: 0x00 -> 0xa7\n  diff[10]: 0x00 -> 0x3f\n  diff[11]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  diff[12]: 0x00 -> 0x1d\n  diff[13]: 0x00 -> 0x56\n  diff[16]: 0x00 -> 0xd3\n  diff[17]: 0x00 -> 0xa3\n  diff[18]: 0x00 -> 0x3f\n  diff[19]: 0x00 -> 0xa0\n  snapshot: total differing bytes: 82 (showing up to 16)\nEXIT_BUS_INIT: valid=2 return=0\n\n</execution_log>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The blanket claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is not correct for the shown code. Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. However, the provided execution log shows that the memory at the lbus addresses is changed by the probe (many bytes flip from 0x00 to other values after metal_linux_probe_bus). That demonstrates the pointed-to linux_bus objects are modified during the loop, so lbus must not be a pointer-to-const. Additionally, the for_each_linux_bus macro and/or metal_linux_probe_bus likely expect and/or perform modifications, so changing the local declaration to const struct linux_bus *lbus would be inappropriate and could conflict with those interfaces. Therefore the report is incorrect."
