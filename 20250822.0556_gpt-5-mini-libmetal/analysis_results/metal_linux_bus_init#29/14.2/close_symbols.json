The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "- for_each_linux_bus (macro): The for-loop in the target is written using this macro. To decide if the for statement is well-formed we must examine the macro expansion to see the three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) and which identifiers it introduces as the loop counter(s). The macro determines whether the first clause defines/initializes the loop counter, what expression is used as the second clause, and what the third clause modifies.\n\n- any iterator/list macros used by that macro (e.g. list_for_each_entry): for_each_linux_bus commonly expands using helper list-iteration macros. Those helpers implement the actual for(;;) clauses; their definitions are required to inspect side effects and the exact expressions used for the loop condition and increment.\n\n- the collection/list head symbol referenced by for_each_linux_bus (the global holding the linux_bus list): The loop condition or increment often references a global list head or iterator state. We must know the exact symbol(s) used (and their types) so we can check whether those objects are modified in the loop body or by functions called from the body (which would violate clause 2/3).\n\n- struct linux_bus (type definition): The local identifier lbus is declared as a pointer to this type. Knowing the type lets us determine whether lbus is the loop counter and whether fields of *lbus are read/modified in the loop condition or by called functions (affects the single-counter / modification rules).\n\n- metal_linux_probe_bus (function definition): This function is called in the loop body. MISRA requires considering the behaviour of any functions called in the loop body; we must inspect this function for modifications to the loop counter, to objects used in the loop condition/increment, or to any globals used by the iterator.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_driver, metal_linux_bus_close, metal_linux_register_bus (function definitions): These are callees of metal_linux_probe_bus (per the call graph). The behaviour of functions called (directly or transitively) inside the loop body is part of the loop body behaviour. We need their definitions to see if they modify the loop counter, the iterator/list head, or any other objects that appear in the for loop condition or third-clause.\n\nNote: In addition to fetching the above concrete symbols, the analyzer should also collect any global objects those functions access/modify that are referenced in the for-loop condition or increment (iterator pointers, list heads, counters). Those globals are not listed here by specific name because their exact identifiers are referenced inside the for_each_linux_bus expansion and in the function definitions above; they must be resolved once the macro/function sources are available."
