  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code and related definitions. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__, asm, __extension__, nested functions, or inline assembly.\n- The metal_container_of macro uses a cast through uintptr_t and a metal_offset_of helper; pointer/integer casts and offsetof are standard C (pointer\u2194integer conversions are implementation-defined but not compiler extensions). There is no evidence of GNU-style container_of using typeof or other extensions.\n- The metal_list_for_each macro expands to a plain for loop \u2014 standard C syntax.\n- The use of (void)bus to silence unused-parameter warnings is standard and portable.\n- Use of standard library identifiers (strcmp, ENODEV) and fixed-width integer types (uintptr_t) reflect standard headers/definitions, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
