  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The statement (void)dev; in metal_generic_dev_sys_open is an executed no-op (it has no runtime effect and dev is not volatile); removing it would not change program behaviour (it only suppresses an unused-parameter warning). Therefore it qualifies as dead code under Rule 2.2 and the agent A report is accurate."
