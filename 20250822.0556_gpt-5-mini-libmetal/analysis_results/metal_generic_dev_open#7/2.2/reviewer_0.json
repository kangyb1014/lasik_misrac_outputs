  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statement '(void)bus;' is an expression statement that has no side-effects and is executed at runtime; removing it does not change program behaviour. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\"Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\"), that statement is dead code. Therefore agent A's report is correct. (If the intent is only to suppress an unused-parameter diagnostic, use an allowed alternative such as removing the parameter name from the prototype or using a standardized UNUSED/attribute mechanism rather than leaving a no-op expression.)"
