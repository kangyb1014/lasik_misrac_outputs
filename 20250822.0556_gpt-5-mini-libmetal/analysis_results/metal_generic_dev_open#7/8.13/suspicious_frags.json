  "explanation": "Fragments not listed need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because they already point to const-qualified data where appropriate or require a mutable pointer by design: - The parameter const char *dev_name and the struct member const char *name are already const-qualified and comply with the rule. - The struct metal_list definition (next/prev) must remain pointers to mutable list nodes because list insertion/removal modify these links; making the pointed-to type const would prevent necessary modifications. - The metal_list_for_each and metal_container_of macros operate on list nodes; their use typically requires non-const pointers to match the macro signatures and to allow generic list manipulation. - The regions array and irq_info members represent device-I/O regions and IRQ information that are typically mutable; making them point to const data would prevent legitimate device setup and runtime updates. - strcmp usage is correct (it takes const char *). - The cast (void)bus; indicates the parameter is unused in this function; the key issue to investigate there is whether the bus parameter should have been declared const in the API (reported above). Other non-reported lines either already satisfy const qualification or must remain non-const for correct behavior, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
