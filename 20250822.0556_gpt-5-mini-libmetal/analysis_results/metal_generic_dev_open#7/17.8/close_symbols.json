  "explanation": "To decide if metal_generic_dev_open modifies any of its parameters (violating the MISRA rule), the analyzer needs the definitions/decls that could change or alias those parameters: \n\n- metal_list_for_each: this macro/inline controls the loop. Its expansion could assign to or otherwise reference function parameters (e.g. reuse names), so you must inspect it to ensure it does not modify the parameter variables (bus, dev_name, device).\n\n- metal_container_of: this macro computes 'dev' from 'node'. Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not perform any writes to function parameters or create aliases to them.\n\n- _metal / _metal.common.generic_device_list: the global list being iterated could be implemented via macros or accessors that reference or modify function parameters; examine its type and accessors to ensure no parameter modification or aliasing occurs.\n\n- struct metal_device (including member 'name'): needed to confirm the types involved (dev is a struct metal_device *), to verify that dev is not an alias of the parameter 'device' itself (only *device is written), and to check that accessing dev->name does not imply modifying the pointer parameter.\n\n- struct metal_list: needed to understand what node is and ensure iteration over the list does not involve or modify function parameters.\n\n- strcmp (declaration): confirm prototype takes const char * so it does not modify dev_name; this shows the call to strcmp cannot illegally modify the dev_name parameter.\n\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open (declaration): inspect its prototype and semantics to ensure the call cannot indirectly modify this function's parameters (none of this function's parameters are passed to it), and to rule out any hidden aliasing through globals or unusual calling conventions.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyzer determine whether any of the parameter variables (bus, dev_name, device) are assigned to or otherwise modified in the body or by called/expanded code. Note: ENODEV or errno macros are not relevant to the parameter-modification rule and are therefore omitted."
