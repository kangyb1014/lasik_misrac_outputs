  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_open:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t   struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_device *dev;\n\n\t(void)bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_open:\n#define metal_list_for_each(list, node) for((node)=(list)->next;(node)!=(list);(node)=(node)->next)\n...\nstruct metal_list {\n\tstruct metal_list *next, *prev;\n}\n...\n#define metal_container_of(ptr, structure, member) (void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nint metal_generic_dev_sys_open(struct metal_device *dev)\n{\n\t(void)dev;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The for-loop macro expands to: for ((node) = (list)->next; (node) != (list); (node) = (node)->next). 'node' is the single loop counter, the second clause (node != list) has no persistent side effects and the third clause modifies only the loop counter. The called function metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev) (as provided) does not modify 'node' or 'list', and the loop body does not modify the loop counter. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated. (If metal_generic_dev_sys_open or the loop body did modify 'node' or 'list', or if the clauses used objects modified in the body, that would be a violation.)"
