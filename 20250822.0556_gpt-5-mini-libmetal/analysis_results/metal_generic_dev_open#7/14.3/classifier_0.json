  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression depends on runtime values (dev->name and dev_name) so it is not invariant. A specific violation scenario would be if the expression were a compile-time constant, e.g. if (strcmp(\"foo\",\"foo\") == 0) or a literal constant like if (1) or if (0), which would make the controlling expression invariant."
