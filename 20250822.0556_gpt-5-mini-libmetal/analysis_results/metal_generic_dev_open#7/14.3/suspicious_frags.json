  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions or are clearly variant at runtime: the function signature and local declarations are not controlling expressions; (void)bus; is a cast to void (not a control expression); the assignment dev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node); is an assignment, not a loop/branch controlling expression; the calls and returns (return metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev); and return -ENODEV;) are not controlling expressions; there are no other loop or branch conditions present. The only places where a controlling expression could be invariant (and thus require inspection) are the loop macro invocation and the conditional shown above."
