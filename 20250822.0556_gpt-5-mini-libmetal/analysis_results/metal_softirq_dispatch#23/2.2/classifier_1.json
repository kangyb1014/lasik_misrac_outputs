Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_dispatch:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_dispatch(void)\n{\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < metal_softirq_num; i++) {\n\t\tstruct metal_irq *irq;\n\t\tchar is_pending = 1;\n\n\t\tif (atomic_load(&metal_softirq_enabled[i]) != 0 &&\n\t\t    atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   &is_pending, 0)) {\n\t\t\tirq = &metal_softirqs[i];\n\t\t\t(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t\t\t\t\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n...\n\n...\n\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call to metal_irq_handle(irq, i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base) is executed conditionally and is expected to have observable side\u2011effects (handling the soft IRQ). Removing that call would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (Hypothetical violation scenario: if metal_irq_handle were an empty/no\u2011side\u2011effect function or an optimizer\u2011removed stub whose invocation had no effect on program state or timing, then the call would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
