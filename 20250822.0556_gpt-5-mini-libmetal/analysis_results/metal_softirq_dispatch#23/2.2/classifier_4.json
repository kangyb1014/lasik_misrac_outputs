Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_dispatch:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_dispatch(void)\n{\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < metal_softirq_num; i++) {\n\t\tstruct metal_irq *irq;\n\t\tchar is_pending = 1;\n\n\t\tif (atomic_load(&metal_softirq_enabled[i]) != 0 &&\n\t\t    atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   &is_pending, 0)) {\n\t\t\tirq = &metal_softirqs[i];\n\t\t\t(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t\t\t\t\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n...\n\n...\n\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nchar is_pending = 1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The local variable initialization 'char is_pending = 1;' is used as the expected value passed to atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i], &is_pending, 0). Its initialization affects the compare-exchange semantics (and thus program behaviour), so removing it would change behaviour. Also, per the rule notes, initialization is not the same as an assignment and is not a candidate for dead code."
