  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" you must know whether the loop and conditional expressions can change across iterations or are effectively constant. Each listed symbol is required as follows:\n\n- metal_softirq_num: the for-loop upper bound (i < metal_softirq_num). You must know its declaration, storage duration and whether it can be modified (directly or indirectly) or is a compile-time constant so you can decide if the loop controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled: used by atomic_load(&metal_softirq_enabled[i]) in the if's left operand. You need its type (atomic type, volatile, size/length) and whether its elements can change (by other threads or by called functions) to determine whether the if-condition can vary.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending: used by atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i], &is_pending, 0). This atomic is both read and written by the compare-exchange; its element-wise mutability affects whether the if-condition is invariant across iterations and whether the compare-exchange has side effects that make the expression non-invariant.\n\n- metal_softirqs: array used to form irq = &metal_softirqs[i]. Knowing its size/relation to metal_softirq_num is necessary to reason whether indexing (and therefore the loop) is sensitive to changes in metal_softirq_num or other state.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: struct providing irq_base (metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base) used when calling metal_irq_handle. Its value could affect behavior of metal_irq_handle and may be modified elsewhere; include to assess whether called functions or other side effects change controlling expressions indirectly.\n\n- metal_irq_handle: the callee invoked inside the loop. You must inspect its definition to see whether it can modify any of the globals above (metal_softirq_num, *_enabled, *_pending, metal_softirq_cntr, etc.) or otherwise affect the loop/if controlling expressions. If it modifies those, the expressions are not invariant.\n\n- atomic_load and atomic_compare_exchange_strong: the semantics and side effects of these atomic primitives (memory-ordering, whether compare_exchange modifies the atomic when it succeeds/fails) determine whether the conditional expression can change state across iterations. Knowing their exact prototypes/semantics used in this code is required to conclude about invariance.\n\n- struct metal_irq: type of elements in metal_softirqs. While not directly affecting the controlling expressions, its definition is needed when inspecting metal_irq_handle or other code that might mutate globals through that pointer, which could in turn affect whether the controlling expressions are invariant.\n\nTogether these symbols allow determination of whether the loop condition (i < metal_softirq_num) or the if-condition (atomic_load(...) != 0 && atomic_compare_exchange_strong(...)) are truly invariant or can change due to atomic operations or side effects from the called function."
