  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions. The other statements in the function are not controlling expressions or are clearly variant and therefore do not need investigation: - The initialization and increment expressions of the for loop (i = 0 and i++) are standard loop control operations, not separate invariant controlling expressions to be flagged. - The local initialization char is_pending = 1; is not a controlling expression; it merely provides an expected value for the atomic operation. - The assignments inside the loop (irq = &metal_softirqs[i];) and the call ( (void)metal_irq_handle(...); ) are ordinary statements with side effects and depend on the changing loop index; they are not controlling expressions. - The atomic operations invoked (atomic_load, atomic_compare_exchange_strong) are runtime actions that read/modify memory and cannot be assumed compile-time invariant; whether their results are invariant depends on the surrounding system state (not evident from this snippet) \u2014 the if-condition was included for investigation for that reason. No other controlling expressions appear in the shown code fragment."
