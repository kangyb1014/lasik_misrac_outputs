  "explanation": "To decide whether any language/compiler extensions are used in metal_softirq_dispatch we must inspect all referenced symbols whose declarations/definitions can hide non\u2011standard constructs: \n\n- metal_softirq_num: its type/definition (macro/const) could be defined using compiler extensions (e.g. non\u2011standard attributes or asm). Needed to check for extensions. \n\n- metal_softirq_enabled: the element type and its declaration determine whether standard C11 atomics are used or a project/compiler extension (typedef/inline functions/macros). Must see its definition to detect use of extensions. \n\n- metal_softirq_pending: same reason as metal_softirq_enabled \u2014 its declared type (atomic type or custom type) and how exchange operates may use compiler builtins or macros that are extensions. \n\n- metal_softirqs: the array and its element type must be inspected to ensure struct/initializer/attributes are standard C and not compiler-specific extensions. \n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: the container type and the irq_base member declaration (e.g. bitfields, attributes, macros) could use extensions; inspect its definition. \n\n- struct metal_irq: the struct layout or any attached attributes (packed, aligned, asm labels) could be extensions \u2014 the type must be checked because it\u2019s passed to metal_irq_handle. \n\n- metal_irq_handle: the function prototype/definition may use compiler-specific function attributes, inline asm, or other extensions; examine its declaration/definition. \n\n- atomic_load and atomic_compare_exchange_strong: these identifiers may be the standard C11 atomic functions/macros or project wrappers that expand to compiler builtins or inline asm. Their exact definitions are required to determine whether only standard language features are used. \n\n- stdatomic.h (or the project atomic wrapper/header used): whether the code includes/uses the C11 header or a non\u2011standard replacement (or defines atomic_* as macros to builtin intrinsics) is essential to detect extension usage. \n\n- __atomic_* / __sync_* builtin implementations (if used by the atomics): if the atomic operations are implemented as gcc/clang builtins or other compiler intrinsics/macros, those are explicit compiler extensions documented by the compiler; their presence must be checked.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their typedefs, macros, headers and function definitions) lets the next analyzer determine if any language/compiler extensions are being used rather than only standard C constructs."
