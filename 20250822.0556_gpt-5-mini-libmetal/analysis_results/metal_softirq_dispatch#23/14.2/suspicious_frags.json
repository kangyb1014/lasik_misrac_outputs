First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not reported as suspicious (and thus not needing investigation for Rule 14.2) include the type/structure declarations (e.g. struct metal_irq) and the METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE macro usage shown in the additional code. Those are declarations and definitions; they do not form part of the for-statement clauses and therefore cannot by themselves violate the well-formedness requirements of Rule 14.2. Other local statements inside the loop that do not affect the loop counter or any object used in the loop's controlling expression (for example simple assignments to temporary locals that are not referenced in the for second/third clauses) are likewise not relevant to the for-loop well-formedness and were not reported. The reported fragments include the for-loop header and the conditional and function-call expressions inside the loop body that could interact with objects named in the for clauses; these are the parts that must be examined to determine compliance with Rule 14.2."
