  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_dispatch:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_dispatch(void)\n{\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < metal_softirq_num; i++) {\n\t\tstruct metal_irq *irq;\n\t\tchar is_pending = 1;\n\n\t\tif (atomic_load(&metal_softirq_enabled[i]) != 0 &&\n\t\t    atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   &is_pending, 0)) {\n\t\t\tirq = &metal_softirqs[i];\n\t\t\t(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t\t\t\t\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n...\nstruct metal_irq {\n\tmetal_irq_handler hd; /**< Interrupt handler */\n\tvoid *arg; /**< Argument to pass to the interrupt handler */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'int i;' declares the single loop counter used by the for loop. The for statement uses i = 0 in the first clause (an expression that sets the loop counter), i < metal_softirq_num in the second clause (uses only the loop counter and an object that is not modified in the loop body), and i++ in the third clause (modifies only the loop counter). The loop body (including called functions) does not modify i. Therefore Rule 14.2 is satisfied."
