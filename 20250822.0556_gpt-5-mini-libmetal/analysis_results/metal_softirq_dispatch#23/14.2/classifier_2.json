  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_softirq_dispatch:\n```c\nvoid metal_softirq_dispatch(void)\n{\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < metal_softirq_num; i++) {\n\t\tstruct metal_irq *irq;\n\t\tchar is_pending = 1;\n\n\t\tif (atomic_load(&metal_softirq_enabled[i]) != 0 &&\n\t\t    atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&metal_softirq_pending[i],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   &is_pending, 0)) {\n\t\t\tirq = &metal_softirqs[i];\n\t\t\t(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t\t\t\t\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n...\nstruct metal_irq {\n\tmetal_irq_handler hd; /**< Interrupt handler */\n\tvoid *arg; /**< Argument to pass to the interrupt handler */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void)metal_irq_handle(irq,\n\t\t\t       i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code: the for loop uses a single loop counter (i) which is initialized in the first clause, tested only against metal_softirq_num in the second clause and incremented only by i++ in the third clause. The call (void)metal_irq_handle(irq, i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base); only reads i and metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base (passed by value) and does not modify the loop counter. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated. Note: a violation would occur if metal_irq_handle (or any other code in the loop body) modified the loop counter or any object used in the loop\u2019s second/third clauses (for example if metal_irq_handle modified metal_softirq_num or metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base), since the behaviour of called functions is considered part of the loop body."
