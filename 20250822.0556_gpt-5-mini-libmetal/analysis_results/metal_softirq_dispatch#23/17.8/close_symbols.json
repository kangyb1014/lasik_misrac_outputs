  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_num: the loop bound; needed to confirm the function has no incoming parameters that are being overwritten by loop control.\\n- metal_softirq_enabled: referenced via atomic_load; its declaration/type is needed to know whether this is a global object (not a function parameter) and to understand any side effects of atomic_load.\\n- metal_softirq_pending: passed by address to atomic_compare_exchange_strong; its declaration/type is required to verify it is a global object (not a parameter of the target function) and to understand how the compare-exchange call operates on the object.\\n- metal_softirqs: array whose element address (irq) is computed and passed to metal_irq_handle; definition/type required to verify that the object passed is not a parameter of the target function.\\n- metal_softirq_cntr: used for irq_base; its definition is needed to confirm irq_base is a global field (not a parameter) and its type/value won\u2019t make the target function modify any of its own parameters.\\n- metal_irq_handle: prototype/signature is required so we can see what parameters it takes (types, whether any are pointer parameters) and to determine whether any parameter of the target function is being passed by reference (the rule concerns modification of the function\u2019s own parameters).\\n- atomic_load: prototype is needed to confirm it does not modify any parameter of the target function (and to understand whether the call could implicitly modify arguments passed).\\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong: prototype is required because it takes pointer(s) and may modify the object pointed to; we must confirm these are globals or locals (not parameters of metal_softirq_dispatch) so the MISRA rule for the target function is not violated.\\n- struct metal_irq: definition is needed because a pointer to this type is passed to metal_irq_handle; knowing the type helps determine whether the call passes any of the target function\u2019s parameters (it does not) and to reason about modifications through that pointer.\\n- types of the atomic elements (e.g. atomic_t / _Atomic char/int): the exact atomic element types clarify how atomic_compare_exchange_strong and atomic_load are invoked and whether any of the passed addresses refer to function parameters rather than globals/locals.\\n\\nIn short: to decide whether metal_softirq_dispatch itself modifies any of its function parameters (MISRA rule), we must confirm the objects it reads/writes (arrays, counters, and locals) are globals or locals and inspect the prototypes of called functions to ensure no target-function parameters are being passed by reference. The listed symbols provide those declarations/definitions."
