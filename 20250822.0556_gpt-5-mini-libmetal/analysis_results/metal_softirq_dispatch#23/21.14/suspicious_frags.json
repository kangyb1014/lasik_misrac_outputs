  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The provided function metal_softirq_dispatch and the related symbols contain no use of memcmp (or other byte-wise comparison of strings) to compare null-terminated strings. The code only uses integer/atomic operations and a call to metal_irq_handle; there are no string objects or string-comparison calls in the supplied code. No additional related definitions were provided that might contain memcmp, so there is nothing to investigate for this rule in the given code."
