  "explanation": "The only function calls in this function body are the atomic operations and the call to metal_irq_handle; there is no direct call to metal_softirq_dispatch, so no evidence of direct recursion. Local declarations (int i; struct metal_irq *irq; char is_pending = 1;), the for-loop header (for (i = 0; i < metal_softirq_num; i++)), and the assignment irq = &metal_softirqs[i]; do not invoke other functions and thus cannot introduce recursion by themselves. The atomic primitives (atomic_load, atomic_compare_exchange_strong) are standard atomic operations (typically macros or library intrinsics) and are extremely unlikely to call back into metal_softirq_dispatch, but the atomic call site is included above so the investigators can confirm their implementation. The assignment of the irq_base expression (i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base) is a pure expression and does not call functions. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for indirect/self recursion beyond the listed function-call sites."
