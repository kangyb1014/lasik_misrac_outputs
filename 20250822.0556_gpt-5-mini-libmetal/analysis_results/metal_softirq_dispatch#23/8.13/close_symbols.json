  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d you must know whether the pointer passed from metal_softirq_dispatch could/should be const and whether that would be feasible. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_irq: the complete type definition (struct) is needed to see which fields exist and whether they are modified by callees; this determines whether a const-qualified pointer to that type would be compatible.\n\n- metal_softirqs: the declaration (array) and its qualifiers are required to see whether the objects stored are declared mutable or const and whether taking a const pointer to an element is permitted.\n\n- metal_irq_handle: the prototype and, crucially, the implementation are required to determine whether the function mutates the pointed-to struct. If metal_irq_handle modifies the struct, the pointer cannot be const; if it does not, the parameter could be const.\n\n- implementation(s) of metal_irq_handle (and its callers that accept struct metal_irq *): any other functions that accept struct metal_irq * and modify the object must be inspected to determine whether the object is conceptually mutable. The implementation(s) are needed to decide whether const qualification is possible across usages.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled and metal_softirq_pending: their declarations (types and qualifiers) are needed because they participate in atomic operations here; their types determine how atomic APIs are used and whether addresses passed to those APIs require non-const pointers (affects whether these objects can/should be const elsewhere).\n\n- declarations/typedefs of the atomic type used for metal_softirq_enabled/pending: the exact atomic type (e.g., atomic_int/atomic_char/atomic_flag or project-specific atomic typedef) and its header define the signatures of atomic_load and atomic_compare_exchange_strong and whether those APIs require non-const pointers.\n\n- atomic_load and atomic_compare_exchange_strong: the declarations/prototypes are needed to confirm whether these functions take non-const pointers or mutable expected-value pointers (e.g., compare_exchange requires a pointer to expected), which affects whether the atomic arrays can be const.\n\n- metal_softirq_num: declaration/type is needed to understand the loop bounds and the type compatibility with array indexing (not directly about constness, but required to reason about indexing and potential aliasing).\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr and metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base: the definition and type of irq_base (and the container struct) are required because irq_base is passed to metal_irq_handle; its type affects the prototype matching and whether metal_irq_handle could be forwarded or overload-checked in a way that enforces mutability/constness.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether the pointer passed (&metal_softirqs[i]) could be declared as pointer-to-const given how the pointed object is used across the codebase, and (2) whether any atomic APIs or parameter/return signatures prevent adding const qualifiers without breaking the code."
