  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce or use pointer types that could be const-qualified: the loop control (int i; for (...) ), scalar accesses (metal_softirq_num, metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base), the local scalar is_pending and its use with atomic_compare_exchange_strong, and the atomic operations on metal_softirq_enabled/metal_softirq_pending operate on atomic types through their API (which requires non-const pointers) rather than ordinary pointer-to-object usages. No other pointer declarations or pointer parameters appear in the shown code snippets that would be candidates for qualification with const, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
