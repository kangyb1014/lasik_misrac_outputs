True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable irq is declared as 'struct metal_irq *irq' and is set to point at elements of the metal_softirqs descriptor array. If metal_irq_handle (or any user of irq) does not need to modify the pointed-to metal_irq object, then irq should be declared as 'const struct metal_irq *irq' so that the pointer points to a const-qualified type. In that common case the current code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, metal_irq_handle legitimately modifies the metal_irq object, then a non-const pointer is required and the rule is not violated.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\nstruct metal_irq {\n\tmetal_irq_handler hd; /**< Interrupt handler */\n\tvoid *arg; /**< Argument to pass to the interrupt handler */\n}\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is plausible but not verifiable from the excerpt: Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to object is not modified through them. In this function irq is assigned &metal_softirqs[i] and then passed to metal_irq_handle; whether the pointed-to metal_irq is ever modified cannot be determined from the shown code. If metal_irq_handle (or other callees) modifies the object, a non-const pointer is required and there is no violation. If metal_irq_handle does not modify the object (and its prototype could accept a pointer-to-const), then the code could be improved by declaring irq as const struct metal_irq * and/or changing the callee prototype \u2014 otherwise this is only a suggestion, not a proven violation. Because the necessary information (the prototype and behaviour of metal_irq_handle and any other users) is not present, the report that this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 cannot be confirmed."
