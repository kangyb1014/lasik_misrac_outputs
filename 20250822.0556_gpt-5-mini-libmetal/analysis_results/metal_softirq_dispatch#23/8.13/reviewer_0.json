True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe member 'void *arg' in struct metal_irq is not const-qualified. If the interrupt handlers only read the context pointer (i.e. the pointed object is not modified and is passed as read-only via metal_irq_handle/handlers), then the pointer should be declared 'const void *arg'. As written, using plain 'void *' violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer could and should be const-qualified.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_softirq_dispatch:\nstruct metal_irq {\n\tmetal_irq_handler hd; /**< Interrupt handler */\n\tvoid *arg; /**< Argument to pass to the interrupt handler */\n}\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\nstatic METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(metal_softirq_cntr,\n\t\t\t\t    METAL_IRQ_ANY, METAL_SOFTIRQ_NUM,\n\t\t\t\t    NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirq_set_enable, NULL,\n\t\t\t\t    metal_softirqs)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when that is possible. Agent A argues that the struct member void *arg should be declared const void *arg because handlers only read the context pointer.\n\nThis claim is not supported by the provided code. The snippet of metal_softirq_dispatch neither proves that the argument is only read nor that it cannot be modified elsewhere. The declaration void *arg is part of the public IRQ API; changing it to const void * would be an API-level change and may be invalid if any interrupt handlers or other users modify the pointed-to object or if metal_irq_handle expects a non-const pointer. MISRA compliance for Rule 8.13 requires analysis of all uses of the pointer to determine whether const-qualification is feasible; you cannot establish a violation from this single fragment alone. Therefore the reported violation is not justified based on the evidence given."
