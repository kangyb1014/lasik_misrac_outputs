  "explanation": "To decide if mutex() (or any function it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect any called code that could contain memcmp calls or pass C strings to memcmp.\n\n- metal_mutex_init: called directly by mutex(); must be checked in case it contains a memcmp call that compares null\u2011terminated strings.\n- metal_run: called directly and is the orchestrator that invokes worker threads; its body may call memcmp itself or pass string pointers/lengths to other callees, so its implementation is required.\n- metal_run_noblock: direct callee of metal_run (listed in the static graph); may contain memcmp usage or logic that results in memcmp being called with C strings.\n- metal_finish_threads: direct callee of metal_run; must be inspected for memcmp usage that could violate the rule.\n- mutex_thread: the thread function pointer passed into metal_run; any memcmp usage here (or string data it receives) could constitute a violation \u2014 this symbol is essential to analyze what the threads do with string data.\n- memcmp: the standard library function itself \u2014 include its call sites (and prototype) so the analyzer can locate uses and check argument origins/types to determine whether the compared objects are null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the rule)."
