  "explanation": "To decide whether the call to metal_run(thread=10, mutex_thread, &lock) makes the target violate the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions, you must inspect the code where control expressions (loops/conditionals) actually occur. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- metal_run: The function invoked with the constant threads value. If metal_run contains loops or conditional controlling expressions that depend directly on the threads parameter (or on values derived solely from it), passing the invariant \"10\" could make those controlling expressions invariant \u2014 so metal_run's body must be examined.\n\n- metal_run_noblock: Identified as a callee of metal_run. Any loop/conditional in metal_run that delegates control to metal_run_noblock may make the invariant controlling expression effectively reside there; you must inspect its control expressions.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Also a callee of metal_run; it may contain loop/conditional logic that completes/coordinates threads. Inspecting it is needed to determine whether any controlling expressions are invariant because of the constant thread count.\n\n- mutex_thread: The thread entry function passed to metal_run. Its internal loops or conditionals might rely on invariants (or on parameters from metal_run). Since it is the work function run by threads, its control expressions must be checked.\n\n- metal_mutex_init: Called from mutex; should be checked in case it contains loops or conditionals with invariant controlling expressions (even though likely simple, it is reachable and therefore relevant).\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Same rationale as metal_mutex_init \u2014 any control expressions in its implementation must be checked for invariance because it is invoked from mutex.\n\n- metal_mutex_t: The type of lock passed into initialization and to threads. Its definition may reveal const/volatile qualifiers or fields that affect control expressions in the other symbols (e.g., if implementations inspect or loop on structure fields). The type is needed to correctly interpret any control expressions that reference lock state.\n\nThese symbols together provide the minimal, local set of function bodies and type information required to determine whether any controlling expression reachable from mutex is invariant (or becomes invariant due to the constant threads value)."
