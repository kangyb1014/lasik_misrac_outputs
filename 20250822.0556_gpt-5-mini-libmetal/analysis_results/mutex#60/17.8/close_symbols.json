  "explanation": "To determine if the target function 'mutex' (or the functions it invokes) violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified' we must inspect any callee that receives arguments from 'mutex' and any type declarations that affect those signatures:\n\n- metal_mutex_init\n  - It is called with &lock. We must inspect its parameter list and body to ensure it does not assign to the pointer parameter variable (i.e. reassign the parameter itself). The rule forbids modifying parameter variables even though modifying the object they point to is allowed.\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit\n  - Same rationale as metal_mutex_init: called with &lock, so we need its prototype/body to verify it does not reassign its pointer parameter.\n\n- metal_run\n  - Called from 'mutex' with (threads, mutex_thread, &lock). We must inspect metal_run's prototype and implementation to see whether it assigns to any of its parameters (the integer 'threads', the function-pointer parameter, or the arg pointer). Any assignment to its parameter variables would violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- metal_run_noblock\n  - metal_run calls this function. If metal_run simply forwards parameters to metal_run_noblock, a parameter modification might occur there instead. Inspect its signature/body for parameter reassignments.\n\n- metal_finish_threads\n  - Called by metal_run; it might receive forwarded parameters. Inspect to ensure it does not modify its parameters.\n\n- mutex_thread\n  - This is the thread entry function passed as a function-pointer argument to metal_run. Inspect its signature and body to ensure it does not reassign its own parameter variables (for example, assigning to the pointer parameter rather than using the object it points to). Even though 'mutex' passes &lock, the rule concerns the callee's parameters.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (type definition / declaration)\n  - Required to understand the types of parameters (pointer types) passed to metal_mutex_init/deinit and mutex_thread so the analysis can distinguish pointer reassignments from modifications of the pointed-to object.\n\nCollecting the above symbols (prototypes and implementations) allows checking every function that receives data from 'mutex' (directly or via forwarding) for assignments to their parameter variables, which is necessary to conclude whether any MISRA parameter-modification violations occur in the call chain started by 'mutex'."
