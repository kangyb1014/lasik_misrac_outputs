  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either clearly require a mutable (non-const) pointer or are unrelated to pointer const-qualification: \n- metal_mutex_init(&lock); and metal_mutex_deinit(&lock); initialize/deinitialize the mutex object and therefore must accept a pointer to mutable data.\n- metal_mutex_acquire(l); and metal_mutex_release(l); modify the internal state of the mutex (locking/unlocking), so the mutex pointer must not be const-qualified.\n- The typedef for metal_mutex_t (typedef struct { atomic_int v; } metal_mutex_t) describes the object type, not a pointer qualification issue by itself.\n- Local declarations and returns (e.g., pthread_t tids[threads]; return NULL; return rc;) are not relevant to whether a pointer should be const-qualified.\n- usleep(1); and other calls that do not take pointers to the same data are unrelated to Rule 8.13.\nThese items therefore do not merit further investigation under Rule 8.13."
