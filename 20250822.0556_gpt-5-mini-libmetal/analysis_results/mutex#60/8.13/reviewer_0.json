True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nmetal_finish_threads is called with (void *)tids where tids is an array of pthread_t. The function parameter is a non-const void * (as used here), but the thread id array is only read (not modified) by the finish routine. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the parameter should be declared const void * (or const pthread_t *) and the call should pass tids without casting. Using a non-const void * (and the explicit (void *) cast) therefore violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nmutex: entry\nmutex: &lock= 0x7ffd936abda4\nmutex: threads=10\nmetal_run_probe: entry threads=10 arg=0x7ffd936abda4\nmetal_run_probe: exit rc=0\nmutex: exit rc=0\nmutex: entry\nmutex: &lock= 0x7ffcee9fb4e4\nmutex: threads=10\nmetal_run_probe: entry threads=10 arg=0x7ffcee9fb4e4\nmetal_run_probe: exit rc=0\nmutex: exit rc=0\n\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function mutex:\ntypedef struct {\n\tatomic_int v;\n} metal_mutex_t\n...\nint metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg)\n{\n\tpthread_t tids[threads];\n\tint error, ts_created;\n\n\terror = metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created);\n\n\tmetal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids);\n\n\treturn error;\n}\n...\nstatic void *mutex_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\tmetal_mutex_t *l = arg;\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_mutex_acquire(l);\n\t\tusleep(1);\n\t\tmetal_mutex_release(l);\n\t}\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in principle. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever the pointee is not modified. In the shown flow, tids is an array of pthread_t that is produced by metal_run_noblock and then only read by metal_finish_threads (to join/finish threads). If metal_finish_threads does not modify the tids array, its parameter should be declared as const void * (or better const pthread_t *). As written, using a non-const void * parameter (and the explicit (void *) cast) is inconsistent with Rule 8.13. Note the only exception would be if metal_finish_threads legitimately modifies the tids objects; in that case a non-const parameter is required and there is no MISRA violation. Otherwise the report is correct and the proper fix is to change the metal_finish_threads prototype/definition to accept a pointer to const and remove the needless cast at the call site."
