  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_init: must be inspected because it may call functions from <string.h> (e.g. memset) on the mutex object; we need to know whether any string/memory functions are used and whether their size/length arguments could exceed the mutex object bounds.\n- metal_mutex_deinit: same rationale as init \u2014 it could perform cleanup using string/memory functions that might access the mutex object or related buffers out-of-bounds.\n- metal_run: the target calls metal_run to create/run threads. metal_run may itself call string/memory functions or forward buffers/lengths to lower-level helpers; its implementation is needed to see any string.h uses and how arguments (including the &lock pointer) are propagated.\n- metal_run_noblock: listed as a callee of metal_run; include it because it may contain string/memory operations invoked by metal_run that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n- metal_finish_threads: listed as a callee of metal_run; include it because it may manipulate thread-related buffers or state using string/memory functions that need bounds checking.\n- mutex_thread: the thread entry function passed to metal_run. It is the most likely place to call string.h functions using the provided &lock or other shared buffers; its body must be analyzed for any memcpy/strcpy/etc. and the sizes/lengths used.\n- metal_mutex_t: the type definition of the mutex object is required to determine the actual size/layout of the object that any string/memory functions operate on (to decide whether accesses are within bounds).\n\nTogether, these symbols (their implementations and the mutex type) are necessary to locate any usage of standard string functions reachable from the target function and to verify that their pointer/length parameters cannot lead to accesses beyond object bounds."
