The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_block_write:\n```c\nint metal_io_block_write(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       const void *restrict src, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tconst unsigned char *source = src;\n\tint retlen;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_write) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_write)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, src, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\twhile ( len && (\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) ||\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)source % sizeof(int)))) {\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\t\tptr++;\n\t\t\tsource++;\n\t\t\tlen--;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tsource += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = *(const unsigned int *)source;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; ptr++, source++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (io->ops.block_write) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_write)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, src, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment itself is a conditional dispatch to an optional function-pointer implementation; as written it is not necessarily dead. However a violation would occur if, across the entire project, io->ops.block_write is guaranteed to be non\u2011NULL (or guaranteed to be NULL) for every possible io object. For example, if every io->ops structure is always initialized at program startup with a valid block_write function pointer and never set to NULL, the else branch (the software fallback loop and atomic fence) would never be executed \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour, so that else branch would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Likewise, if block_write is always NULL, the call branch would be dead."
