  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA Rule analysis:\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  Need the definition (field types and widths, especially the 'size' member and the 'ops' member type) to verify how io->size is interpreted and whether the bounds calculation (offset + len > io->size) is valid for the region object; this determines the intended maximum valid byte range for ptr returned by metal_io_virt.\n\n- struct metal_io_ops\n  The layout and types of the ops structure are required to identify and type-check the block_write member and to know whether other ops might influence pointer validity.\n\n- metal_io_ops::block_write (prototype and behavioral contract)\n  The target function calls ops.block_write when present. To judge whether that call can cause out-of-bounds memory accesses (relative to the io region or src buffer) you must know the block_write prototype, parameter semantics (does its 'len' parameter limit accesses?), and its contract (is it guaranteed to only access bytes within the region and only read 'len' bytes from src?). If block_write can access more than len or beyond io->size, the MISRA rule could be violated via that call.\n\n- metal_io_virt (prototype and behavioral contract)\n  metal_io_block_write immediately uses the pointer returned by metal_io_virt and performs pointer arithmetic and dereferences. You must know whether metal_io_virt returns a pointer to a buffer of length (io->size - offset), whether it can return an alias into a larger or smaller object, and whether its pointer is valid for writes. Without metal_io_virt's guarantees you cannot conclude the pointer arithmetic/dereferences are within bounds.\n\n- caller-provided src buffer length / contract for 'src'\n  The function reads up to 'len' bytes from the src pointer (either via block_write or via explicit copying). To determine whether those reads can go out-of-bounds you need the caller-side contract: how many valid bytes does src point to? If src's object is shorter than len, accesses will be out-of-bounds (this is the direct subject of the MISRA string-handling/buffer-overflow rule).\n\n- memory_order_seq_cst (definition) and atomic_thread_fence (prototype/semantics)\n  These symbols do not alter buffer bounds, but their semantics are used in the call to block_write and at function end. To be thorough, include them so the analyzer can confirm they do not affect pointer validity or cause hidden accesses that could violate bounds.\n\n- uintptr_t (typedef / width) and platform alignment/unaligned-access rules (sizeof(int), alignment requirements)\n  The function uses ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) and casts to unsigned int * and performs word-sized reads/writes. To know whether these casts and accesses are safe and whether they might cross object boundaries (or invoke undefined behavior on unaligned access), the analyzer needs the definition/width of uintptr_t, the value of sizeof(int) on the target platform, and architecture rules about unaligned accesses.\n\n- ABI / compiler strict-aliasing rules relevant to casting between unsigned char * and unsigned int *\n  The manual copying performs writes via *(unsigned int *)ptr = *(const unsigned int *)source. Analysis must consider aliasing and effective type rules to determine whether these accesses are permissible and whether they could legally access memory the pointers do not reference. This affects whether the operations could constitute out-of-bounds or undefined accesses under the language rules.\n\nCollectively, these symbols and contracts are necessary to decide if the pointer arithmetic, read/writes, and the conditional call to block_write can ever access bytes beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by the pointer parameters (io-backed region and src), which is the substance of the MISRA string/buffer-bounds rule."
