  "explanation": "To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion you must be able to trace every call-edge out of metal_io_block_write and follow it back (if any) to metal_io_block_write. Rationale for each symbol: \n\n- metal_io_virt: metal_io_block_write calls this function directly; you must inspect its body to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_io_block_write. \n\n- struct metal_io_region and its ops struct (definition): the code calls io->ops.block_write via a function pointer. You need the struct/type definitions to identify the pointer type and where/when it can be set. \n\n- All functions assignable to metal_io_region->ops.block_write: any function stored into ops.block_write and callable here could call back (directly or indirectly) to metal_io_block_write. You must examine every such implementation to determine if a cycle exists. \n\n- Transitive callees of each block_write implementation: if a block_write implementation calls other functions, those transitive callees must be examined for a potential path back to metal_io_block_write. \n\n- metal_io_block_read, metal_io_block_set, shmem_child: these appear in the static graph as callers of metal_io_virt. Although they do not appear as direct callees of metal_io_block_write, they are relevant when reasoning about alternative call-paths or assignments (e.g., if any of these functions are used to set ops.block_write or if they are reachable from any block_write implementations). \n\nNote: atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_seq_cst are not relevant to detecting recursion and can be ignored for this MISRA rule check."
