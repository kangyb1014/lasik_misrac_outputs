  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments for investigation because they do not appear to conflict with MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically:\n\n- The src parameter and its local alias are already const-qualified (\"const void *restrict src\" and \"const unsigned char *source = src;\"), so they comply with the requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types when possible.\n\n- The local pointer 'ptr' is used as a write target throughout the function (the code stores through ptr), so making the pointed-to type const would be incompatible with the intended writes; therefore those write operations and the casted assignment expressions that store through ptr are not candidates for const-qualification.\n\n- The pointer casts on the right-hand side use const-qualified types (e.g. \"(const unsigned int *)source\"), which is consistent with the rule.\n\nThe three fragments reported should be inspected to determine whether the region descriptor pointer (io), the returned virtual pointer (metal_io_virt -> assigned to ptr) and the way io is passed into ops.block_write could/should use const-qualified pointer types (or whether the called ops require non-const). These are the locations most relevant to Rule 8.13 in the provided code."
