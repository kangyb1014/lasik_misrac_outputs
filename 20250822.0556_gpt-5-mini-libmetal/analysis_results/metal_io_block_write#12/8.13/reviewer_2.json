True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function parameter 'io' is declared as a non-const pointer (struct metal_io_region *io) but the function does not modify the pointed-to object; it only reads members (io->size, io->ops) and calls metal_io_virt. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, 'io' should be declared as a pointer to const (const struct metal_io_region *io) when possible. Note: 'src' and the local 'source' are const-qualified and the write-target 'ptr' must remain non-const because the function writes through it.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_io_block_write:\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although metal_io_block_write only reads io->size and io->ops in the local code path, the function passes io to other functions (metal_io_virt and io->ops.block_write). Those operations are part of the I/O API and almost certainly expect a non-const struct metal_io_region * (and block_write may legitimately modify the region or at least is declared to take a non-const pointer). Making io a pointer-to-const would therefore be incompatible with those calls unless those callee signatures were also changed. In short, you cannot safely qualify io as const here because it is forwarded to functions that take a non-const pointer; therefore the agent A's claim that this violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is not correct in this context."
