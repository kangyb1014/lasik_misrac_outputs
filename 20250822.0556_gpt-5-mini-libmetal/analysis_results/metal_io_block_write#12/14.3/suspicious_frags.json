  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. Each loop\u2019s controlling expression is variant because it depends on variables that are changed inside the loop bodies:\n- while ( len && ( ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) || ((uintptr_t)source % sizeof(int)) )): depends on len, ptr, and source \u2014 all are modified (len--, ptr++, source++) inside the loop, so the condition is not invariant.\n- for (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int), source += sizeof(int), len -= sizeof(int)): depends on len which is decremented by sizeof(int) in the iteration expression, so the condition is variant.\n- for (; len != 0; ptr++, source++, len--): depends on len which is decremented each iteration, so the condition is variant.\nNo do-while or intentional infinite-loop (constant true) constructs are present. Other control statements (if checks) are not loop controlling expressions and do not present invariance concerns under Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
