  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they matter for detecting language extensions:\n\n- metal_io_virt\n  - Need the function declaration/definition to see if it uses any compiler-specific attributes, calling conventions, or nonstandard return type qualifiers (e.g. __attribute__, __fastcall, inline semantics, or other extensions). The call site alone does not show whether the callee was declared with an extension that affects the target function's correctness or use of extensions.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - The struct definition (members and their types) is required to check for nonstandard language features in its declaration: use of compiler-specific attributes on the type or members, bit-field widths that rely on implementation specifics, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, anonymous structures/unions (which can be an extension in some compilers), or any nonstandard typedefs for members (for example io->size type). Also needed to confirm the exact type of the ops member.\n\n- io->ops.block_write (function pointer type in struct metal_io_region)\n  - The type and declaration of this function pointer must be inspected to determine whether it uses compiler extensions: nonstandard calling conventions, attribute annotations, or nonportable parameter/return types (for example use of atomic enums, vendor extension attributes, or variable-length parameter lists). The call in the target function invokes this pointer; its declaration can reveal extensions that the call relies upon.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence\n  - This symbol is used in the code. It may be a standard C11 atomic function, or it may be a macro/wrapper that maps to a compiler builtin (e.g. __atomic_thread_fence or __sync_synchronize) or vendor-specific extension. You must inspect its definition to determine whether it is a standard-language symbol or a compiler extension.\n\n- memory_order_seq_cst\n  - This identifier is used as an argument to atomic_thread_fence and may be the standard C11 atomic memory-order constant or a nonstandard macro/enum. Its definition reveals whether the code uses standard C11 atomics or relies on a compiler-specific extension/alias.\n\n- uintptr_t\n  - This typedef (from stdint.h in standard C) must be inspected to ensure it is the standard typedef and not a compiler-specific alias or macro. Some environments may provide nonstandard definitions or additional attributes tied to uintptr_t; verifying its declaration ensures no extensions are hidden here.\n\n- ERANGE\n  - This macro is used as a return error value (-ERANGE). Its definition (normally from errno.h) should be checked to confirm it is a standard errno macro and not a project/compiler-specific extension or redefinition.\n\nTogether these symbol definitions allow checking whether any nonstandard or compiler-specific language extensions are used directly by the target function (via types, macros, attributes, or called symbols) or indirectly through the types and functions it uses."
