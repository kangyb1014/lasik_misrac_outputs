  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_io_block_write violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings you must examine not only this function body but also any code it can invoke or that can be invoked through its function-pointer members. Specifically:\n\n- struct metal_io_region: needed to know the types and semantics of io->size and io->ops and to find where ops is initialized/assigned. This tells you what block_write can be at runtime and whether any fields imply string usage.\n\n- io->ops structure definition (e.g. metal_io_ops): required so you can identify the exact type and signature of the block_write pointer and locate all places in the codebase that assign implementations to it.\n\n- All implementations/assignments of ops.block_write: metal_io_block_write calls the block_write callback when present; that callback could itself call memcmp (possibly comparing null-terminated strings). You must inspect every function that can be called via io->ops.block_write to see if memcmp is used incorrectly.\n\n- metal_io_virt implementation: metal_io_block_write calls metal_io_virt; that function (or its transitive callees) might call memcmp or otherwise perform string comparisons. You must inspect its definition to ensure no memcmp-on-string occurs there.\n\n- Transitive callees of metal_io_virt: any functions called by metal_io_virt may contain memcmp usage; include them to make the analysis sound.\n\n- memcmp and any wrappers/macros that resolve to it: to detect usage in the codebase you need the memcmp symbol and any project-specific wrappers/aliases (or bcmp-like functions that map to memcmp). The MISRA rule is about memcmp used on null-terminated strings, so finding occurrences (direct or via wrappers) is essential.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether any execution path from metal_io_block_write (direct code, metal_io_virt, or the block_write callback) invokes memcmp in a way that compares null-terminated strings."
