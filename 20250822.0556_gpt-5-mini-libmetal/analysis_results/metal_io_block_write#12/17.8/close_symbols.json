  "explanation": "1) struct metal_io_region (definition) \u2014 The function reads io->size and io->ops. To decide whether the function is modifying a parameter (io) versus modifying data the parameter points to, you must know the layout and types of the struct (especially the types of size and ops). This shows that io is dereferenced (allowed) and that accesses like io->size are reads from the pointed-to object, not writes to the parameter itself.\n\n2) metal_io_region->ops (type) and member block_write (function-pointer signature) \u2014 The code branches on io->ops.block_write and, if present, calls it. You need the exact signature of block_write (parameter types: are any parameters pointers that could alias the caller's parameters?) to determine whether calling it could modify this function's parameter objects or whether the call passes addresses that would permit modification of the parameter variables. In short, the block_write type tells you whether any argument could cause the caller's parameter storage to be modified.\n\n3) implementations of any block_write functions assigned to io->ops.block_write \u2014 If block_write is non-NULL at run-time, its implementation may have side effects. To be sure the target function itself does not modify its parameters, you must review reachable block_write implementations to confirm they do not rely on modifying the caller's parameter variables (for example, if they expect to be passed an int* or modify memory that aliases a parameter variable). This is required for a complete analysis in configurations where block_write is used.\n\n4) metal_io_virt (prototype/definition) \u2014 metal_io_virt is called with (io, offset) and its return drives pointer arithmetic that follows. You must know whether metal_io_virt has any non-obvious side effects on the function parameters (e.g., modifies io or offset via pointer/aliasing or uses unusual calling conventions/macros). It also establishes whether ptr can alias src or parameter storage (affecting whether writes through ptr could be considered modifying a parameter object).\n\n5) atomic_thread_fence (declaration) and memory_order_seq_cst (definition) \u2014 These are invoked at the end. Ensure these are standard fence primitives (no hidden macros that write into parameter storage). Confirming their ordinary behavior lets you rule them out as sources of parameter modification.\n\nNote: C language tokens such as 'src', 'offset', and 'len' are parameters in the function signature; the above symbols are included only to rule out indirect or implementation-specific ways the function could modify those parameter objects. Reviewing the listed symbols is sufficient to determine whether the function itself (including calls it makes) modifies its parameter variables (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
