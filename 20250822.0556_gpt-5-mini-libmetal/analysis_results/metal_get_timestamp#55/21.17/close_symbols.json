  "explanation": "- metal_log: The target function calls metal_log on error. If metal_log (or routines it calls) uses any <string.h> functions, those uses are the only place a string-handling bound violation could originate from. To decide compliance you need metal_log's prototype and its full implementation or its callee list.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The log level/macro can affect code paths inside metal_log (format selection, buffer use). Knowing its definition helps determine which metal_log code path executes.\n- memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn: These are the standard <string.h> functions named in the MISRA rule. You must know whether metal_log (or any function it calls) uses any of these functions and with what buffer pointers and lengths so you can check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Provide their prototypes/implementations as used by the code (or the exact calls and argument relationships).\n- (implementation or prototype of any functions called by metal_log that in turn call the above <string.h> functions): If metal_log delegates formatting or buffering to other internal helpers or library wrappers, provide those symbols/implementations so their uses of <string.h> functions can be inspected.\n\nNotes: clock_gettime, struct timespec, CLOCK_MONOTONIC and NS_PER_S are used by the target function but do not involve <string.h> functions; they do not affect compliance with the quoted MISRA rule except indirectly (e.g. if metal_log is invoked). The core requirement to assess the MISRA string\u2011handling rule here is visibility into metal_log and any string.h calls it (directly or transitively) makes."
