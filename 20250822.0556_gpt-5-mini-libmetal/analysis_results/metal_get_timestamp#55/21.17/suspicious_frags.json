  "explanation": "No direct use of any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in metal_get_timestamp itself: the function only calls clock_gettime, performs integer arithmetic on tp.tv_sec and tp.tv_nsec, and returns the computed timestamp. The local declarations (unsigned long long t, struct timespec tp, int r) and the arithmetic t = tp.tv_sec * (NS_PER_S); t += tp.tv_nsec; do not involve string handling. The only code in the provided fragments that could potentially invoke string-handling behavior is the logging invocation and its macro definition: the call to metal_log(...) and the macro that expands to a call to _metal.common.log_handler(level, metal_fmt(fmt), ...). Those are reported above because metal_fmt and the log handler implementations (not provided here) might internally call string.h functions; those implementations should be inspected to ensure they do not perform out-of-bounds accesses. Other lines and constructs in the given code do not use or reference the <string.h> functions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
