  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function appears to be statically unreachable. Reasoning:\n- All statements in metal_get_timestamp are reachable depending on the result of clock_gettime(): the if (r == -1) branch executes on error and returns; the subsequent assignments and final return execute on success. No unconditional return, infinite loop, or jump prior to later statements makes them unreachable.\n- The metal_log macro expands to a conditional call wrapped in a GCC statement-expression; it does not introduce an unconditional return, break, goto, or infinite loop that would render following code unreachable. (Although the macro uses a GCC extension, that is a portability/standards concern, not an unreachable-code issue.)\n- NS_PER_S is a simple integer macro and does not cause dead code.\n- There are no preprocessor conditionals or other constructs in the provided snippets that would eliminate code paths and create unreachable code.\n\nTherefore no fragments need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want, I can also point out non-unreachability issues to review (e.g., integer promotions/overflow, use of GCC extensions) but those are outside Rule 2.1."
