  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The function contains a single if (r == -1) where r is assigned from clock_gettime at runtime, so the condition is not a compile-time constant. The metal_log macro expands to an if(_metal.common.log_handler && level <= _metal.common.log_level) which depends on the runtime _metal.common.log_handler and _metal.common.log_level (level may be a constant argument but the combined expression is not invariant), so it does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other selection/iteration statements with constant controlling expressions (the NS_PER_S macro is a numeric constant used in an arithmetic expression, not a controlling expression). Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
