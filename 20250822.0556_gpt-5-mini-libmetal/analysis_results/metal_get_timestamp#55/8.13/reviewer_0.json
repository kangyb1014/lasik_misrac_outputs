Passing a string literal (\"clock_gettime failed!\\n\") to a non-const char * means the pointer does not point to a const-qualified type even though it should\u2014this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct, but it is conditional on the prototype of metal_log. The call\n    metal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"clock_gettime failed!\\n\");\npasses a string literal (an object that must not be modified) to metal_log. If metal_log is declared to take a non-const char * (for example: void metal_log(int level, char *msg);) then that prototype should be const-qualified because the function is being given an immutable string \u2014 this is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 warns about. In that case the report is correct and the appropriate fix is to change the prototype to accept const char * (e.g. void metal_log(int level, const char *msg);).\n\nIf, however, metal_log is already declared to take a const char * (or otherwise legitimately needs a non-const pointer because it modifies the buffer), then there is no Rule 8.13 violation in the shown call. The source snippet alone does not show the metal_log prototype, so the violation is only present when the prototype uses a non-const pointer type."
