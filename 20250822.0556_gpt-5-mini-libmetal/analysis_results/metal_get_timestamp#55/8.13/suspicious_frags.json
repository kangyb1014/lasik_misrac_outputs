  "explanation": "Only one pointer-related usage in this function is potentially questionable: the string literal passed to metal_log may be being supplied to a non-const char * parameter (which would violate Rule 8.13 if the pointer should be const). The call to clock_gettime with &tp is not suspicious: clock_gettime\u2019s prototype requires a modifiable struct timespec * and the function populates tp, so a non-const pointer is appropriate. There are no other pointer usages in this function that could reasonably be const-qualified."
