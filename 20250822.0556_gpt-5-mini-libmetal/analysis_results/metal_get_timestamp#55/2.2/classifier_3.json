Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_get_timestamp:\n```c\nunsigned long long metal_get_timestamp(void)\n{\n\tunsigned long long t = 0;\n\tstruct timespec tp;\n\tint r;\n\n\tr = clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp);\n\tif (r == -1) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"clock_gettime failed!\\n\");\n\t\treturn t;\n\t}\n\tt = tp.tv_sec * (NS_PER_S);\n\tt += tp.tv_nsec;\n\n\treturn t;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_get_timestamp:\n#define NS_PER_S (1000*1000*1000)\n...\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (r == -1) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"clock_gettime failed!\\n\");\n\t\treturn t;\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the metal_log invocation can have observable side effects (it may call _metal.common.log_handler when that handler is non-NULL and the log level permits), so the statement cannot be removed without potentially changing program behaviour. Therefore, as shown, this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: it would only be dead code if it could be proven that the condition inside the macro is always false\u2014e.g. if _metal.common.log_handler is guaranteed NULL or level checks are always false\u2014making the log invocation provably ineffective; that is not the case from the given code.)"
