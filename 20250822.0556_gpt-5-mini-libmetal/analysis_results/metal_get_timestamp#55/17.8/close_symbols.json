  "explanation": "clock_gettime \u2014 need the function prototype/definition to see its parameter types (it takes a struct timespec *). This establishes that the only pointer passed (&tp) is to a local object, not a parameter of metal_get_timestamp, so the call does not violate the rule for this function's parameters.\nCLOCK_MONOTONIC \u2014 the clock id macro/constant used in the clock_gettime call; include to ensure it is not a macro that expands to some expression or code that could modify function parameters.\nstruct timespec \u2014 the struct definition is required to know the nature of tp (its members, whether any member is a pointer that might alias a function parameter). Specifically inspect tv_sec and tv_nsec types and whether they can alias external objects.\ntv_sec, tv_nsec \u2014 explicit members used in arithmetic; include to ensure they are scalar members (not pointers) and therefore reading them and using them in assignments cannot be considered modification of a function parameter.\nNS_PER_S \u2014 macro used in the multiplication; include its definition to ensure it is a simple numeric macro (not a function-like macro or expression that could modify state or parameters when expanded).\nmetal_log \u2014 prototype of the logging function to confirm that the logging call cannot modify any parameter of metal_get_timestamp (none are passed) via side-effects or macro expansion.\nMETAL_LOG_ERROR \u2014 logging-level macro/constant used as an argument to metal_log; include to ensure it does not expand to code that could alter parameters.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule in question forbids modifying a function's own parameters. metal_get_timestamp has no parameters, so the crucial checks are that no called functions or macros expand/behave in a way that would alter any of this function's (nonexistent) parameters or mutate objects that are actually parameters (none). The listed symbols are the ones whose definitions/prototypes/macros must be inspected to verify that all pointer usage is to local objects and that no macro expansions introduce hidden parameter modification."
