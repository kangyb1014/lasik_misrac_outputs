  "explanation": "For checking whether the function uses any compiler language extensions we must inspect all referenced declarations/macros/types to see if any are implemented with compiler-specific extensions (intrinsics, statement-expressions, attributes, non\u2011standard builtins, feature-test macros that enable extensions, etc.). Each listed symbol is required for that inspection:\n\n- clock_gettime: prototype/definition must be checked to determine whether it is a normal library/POSIX function or exposed as a compiler intrinsic/extension in the target environment.\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC: this macro/constant must be inspected to see how it is defined (macro, enum, attribute-annotated constant) and whether its definition uses compiler extensions.\n- struct timespec: the full struct definition is required to verify the types and members used (tv_sec, tv_nsec) and to ensure no nonstandard/extension fields or compiler-specific attributes are present.\n- tv_sec: the member type and its definition (usually time_t) must be known to see if any nonstandard type or extension is used in arithmetic (e.g., nonstandard 64-bit type or extension-specific typedef).\n- tv_nsec: same as tv_sec \u2014 the member type must be checked for nonstandard/extension usage.\n- time_t: used by tv_sec; its underlying typedef may be implementation-defined or provided via an extension \u2014 needs checking to ensure no compiler extension is relied upon.\n- NS_PER_S: the macro/value used in the multiplication must be examined (its literal form, suffixes, casts, or expression) to determine whether it employs nonstandard literal forms or extension constructs (e.g., GNU integer literal extensions, statement expressions, type-carrying macros).\n- metal_log: this function (or macro) must be inspected to see whether it is actually a macro that expands to compiler-specific constructs (statement-expression GNU extension, asm, attributes) or otherwise uses language extensions.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: the logging-level macro must be checked (it might expand to an expression, enum, or use extension-specific constructs) so we can be sure no extension is used via this macro.\n\nOnly by examining the definitions/declarations of these symbols (and any headers/feature-test macros that control their visibility) can we determine whether the target function relies on any compiler language extensions."
