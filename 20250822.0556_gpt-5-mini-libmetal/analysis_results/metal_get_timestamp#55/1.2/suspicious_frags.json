  "explanation": "The rest of the code in metal_get_timestamp and the NS_PER_S macro do not use compiler language extensions and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 1.2. Specifically: - The function definition, local variable declarations, arithmetic on tp.tv_sec and tp.tv_nsec, and the return statement are standard C. - struct timespec, clock_gettime and CLOCK_MONOTONIC are POSIX APIs (library/OS interfaces), not compiler language extensions. - The NS_PER_S numeric macro is a plain preprocessor macro definition and not a compiler extension. Therefore only the provided macro definition needs further investigation for possible compiler-specific language extensions."
