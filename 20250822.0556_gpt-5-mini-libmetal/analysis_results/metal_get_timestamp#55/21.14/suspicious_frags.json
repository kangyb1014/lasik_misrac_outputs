  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function metal_get_timestamp and the related macro definitions. There are no occurrences of the standard library function memcmp in the target function nor in the provided additional code (metal_log macro, NS_PER_S). The code performs time retrieval (clock_gettime) and integer arithmetic on tp.tv_sec and tp.tv_nsec \u2014 no string operations or comparisons are present. The metal_log macro shown does not include memcmp (it forwards to metal_fmt and a log handler, but no definition containing memcmp was provided). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings)."
