  "explanation": "I examined the body of mutex_thread and the related symbol definitions. There is no use of the standard library function memcmp anywhere in the provided code. The fragment only calls metal_mutex_acquire, usleep, and metal_mutex_release and uses an integer loop counter; there are no char buffers, string literals, or string comparisons present. The typedef for metal_mutex_t and the mutex_test_count definition do not involve memcmp or any string operations. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
