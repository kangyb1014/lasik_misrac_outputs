  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: must inspect the function body to see whether it (or any callees) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. A violation could occur in any callee of mutex_thread.\\n- metal_mutex_release: same reason as above \u2014 its implementation might contain memcmp usage that would make the overall call chain violate the MISRA rule.\\n- usleep: mutex_thread calls usleep(1); include its symbol to confirm it and its callees do not use memcmp on C strings (the static call graph omitted it, but the direct call is in the source).\\n- mutex_test_count: global loop bound used by mutex_thread; include to fully understand loop behavior (number of iterations) when checking whether any memcmp use in callees is reachable/exercised.\\n- metal_mutex_t: the type of the argument 'l' \u2014 include its definition to see whether the mutex object contains or references string buffers whose comparisons (e.g., in acquire/release) might use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nCollecting the implementations/definitions of these symbols lets the next analyst search for any memcmp uses in mutex_thread and its direct callees and determine if any such use compares null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
