  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter 'arg' itself. The only use of the parameter is in the assignment 'metal_mutex_t *l = arg;', which copies the pointer value into a local variable rather than altering 'arg'. Subsequent operations call metal_mutex_acquire(l) and metal_mutex_release(l), which may modify the object pointed to by the pointer \u2014 this is explicitly permitted by Rule 17.8. There are no assignments to 'arg' (e.g. 'arg = ...'), no increments/decrements of 'arg', and no other operations that would change the parameter value. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
