  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: need its prototype or macro definition to determine the parameter type and whether the call could (by signature or macro expansion) modify the caller's parameter variable. If it takes e.g. metal_mutex_t * or is a macro that performs assignments, that affects the analysis of whether the function parameter 'arg' is effectively modified.\n- metal_mutex_release: same rationale as for metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 its declaration or macro body is required to confirm it does not modify the calling function's parameter variable (for example via unexpected pointer-to-pointer semantics or macro expansion that names/assigns the caller's parameter).\n- metal_mutex_t: the typedef/struct definition is required to know whether metal_mutex_t is itself a pointer type (e.g. a typedef to a pointer). That changes the effective types in the assignment \"metal_mutex_t *l = arg;\" and affects whether any subsequent calls could operate on pointer-to-pointer objects (which bears on whether the parameter variable could be considered modified).\n- mutex_test_count: the loop bound is part of the function; its declaration (type) is needed to understand loop behavior and confirm there is no hidden use of 'arg' (e.g. via macros or overloaded identifiers) that might modify the parameter.\n- usleep: its prototype (or macro) is required to ensure the call does not, via macro expansion, reference or modify the function parameter 'arg'. Although unlikely, a macro could capture identifier names and alter local variables; the declaration/macro body rules this out.\n\nOnly these symbols are necessary to conclude whether the parameter variable 'arg' is modified inside mutex_thread (the object pointed to may be altered by the mutex calls, which is allowed by the MISRA rule)."
