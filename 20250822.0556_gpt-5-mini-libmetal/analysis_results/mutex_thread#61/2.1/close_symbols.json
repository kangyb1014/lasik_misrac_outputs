  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: Needed to check whether this callee can fail to return (e.g. exit(), longjmp(), infinite loop) or contains internal unreachable code that would make the remainder of the loop or function unreachable.\n- metal_mutex_release: Same reason as acquire \u2014 if release does not return or unconditionally transfers control elsewhere the loop or later code could be unreachable.\n- usleep: Although normally returns, it could be a macro or wrapper in this codebase that alters control flow; include to ensure it does not make subsequent statements unreachable.\n- mutex_test_count: The for-loop iteration count depends on this symbol. If it is a compile-time constant equal to 0 (or otherwise provably zero/unreachable), the loop body would be unreachable. You must inspect its definition and any compile-time constants/macros that determine it.\n- call sites that may start this thread (e.g. pthread_create, metal_thread_create or other thread-creation wrappers): The static call graph shows mutex_thread has no callers. To decide whether the entire function is unreachable in the project you must inspect all places that could register/use it as a thread entry (function-pointer usage). Include any thread-creation APIs or translation units that might reference mutex_thread to determine if the function itself is ever invoked."
