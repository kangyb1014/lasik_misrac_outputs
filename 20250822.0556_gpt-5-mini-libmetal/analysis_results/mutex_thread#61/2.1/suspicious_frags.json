  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function. Every statement can be executed at runtime: the local declarations are executed on entry, the for-loop condition uses a compile-time constant mutex_test_count (given as 1000) so the loop body (metal_mutex_acquire, usleep, metal_mutex_release) is reachable for iterations 0..999, and the final return NULL is reachable after the loop. There are no unconditional jumps, early returns, #if 0 blocks, or other constructs that would make any statement in this fragment permanently unreachable. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 2.1 in the supplied code."
