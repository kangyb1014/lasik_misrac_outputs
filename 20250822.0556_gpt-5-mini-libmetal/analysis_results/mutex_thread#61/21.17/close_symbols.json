  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: The target function calls this routine. To determine whether any string.h function is invoked (or any buffer access via pointer parameters is performed) inside the call chain, the implementation/prototype is required.\n- metal_mutex_release: Same as above \u2014 the release call must be inspected to ensure it does not call any string handling functions or perform out-of-bounds accesses on pointers passed from mutex_thread.\n- metal_mutex_t: The target casts its argument to this type. Its definition is required to know the layout/fields and whether pointers owned by mutex_thread (or passed into mutex API) could be used later in string operations.\n- mutex_test_count: The loop bound is read from this global. Its type/value influences control flow and whether repeated calls could expose out-of-bounds behaviour; include its declaration to ensure correct interpretation.\n- usleep: Called inside the loop. Include the prototype/implementation to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) invoke string.h functions that could operate on pointers from this function.\n- NULL: The function returns NULL. Include the macro/definition to confirm it is the standard null pointer constant (no string operations implied).\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the target function or its immediate callees use any string.h routines that could produce out-of-bounds accesses on pointer parameters passed from mutex_thread. If metal_mutex_acquire/release call further internal helpers, those helpers should be included as well when discovered."
