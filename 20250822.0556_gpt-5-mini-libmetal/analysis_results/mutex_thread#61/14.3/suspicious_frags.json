  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant in the sense of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Reasons:\n\n- mutex_thread: for (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++) \u2014 although mutex_test_count is a static const, the controlling expression depends on i which is modified each iteration, so the expression is not invariant.\n\n- producer_thread: while (counter == COUNTER_MAX) \u2014 the loop condition depends on counter, a variable that can change (by other threads), so it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- consumer_thread: while (!counter) \u2014 likewise depends on counter and is not invariant.\n\n- metal_condition_wait: contains no loop with a compile-time constant controlling expression; the function uses checks and a futex syscall but no invariant controlling expression.\n\nNo do-while (0) macro patterns or other constant boolean loop conditions are present that would require the listed exceptions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under Rule 14.3."
