  "explanation": "Only the function parameter declaration and the local pointer assignment involve pointer types and potential const-qualification issues; these are the fragments that need investigation for Rule 8.13. Other lines do not declare or change pointer types and thus do not need to be inspected for this rule: the local integer declaration and loop control (int i; for (...)), the calls that use the pointer (metal_mutex_acquire(l); metal_mutex_release(l); usleep(1);) are uses of the pointer rather than pointer declarations, and the return statement (return NULL;) does not affect pointer const-qualification. Therefore no other fragments require investigation for this rule."
