  "scenario": "The pointer 'l' is used to call metal_mutex_acquire(l) and metal_mutex_release(l), which operate on and modify the mutex object. Because the pointee is modified through these calls, the pointer cannot be const-qualified; therefore it is appropriate that 'l' is a non-const pointer. If the code did not modify the pointee, a const-qualified pointer should be used, but that is not the case here."
