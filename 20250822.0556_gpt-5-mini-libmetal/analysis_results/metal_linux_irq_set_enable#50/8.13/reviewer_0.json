In typical use (see METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(linux_irq_cntr, ..., irqs)) this member points to a fixed array of IRQ descriptors that the controller only reads. If the controller never modifies the pointed-to descriptors, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (const struct metal_irq *irqs). As declared it permits modification of the pointed-to objects and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to objects are not modified through those pointers. However, the mere fact that linux_irq_cntr.irqs is initialized from a fixed array does not automatically mean it cannot be modified via the pointer. In this API the controller exposes operations such as irq_register (and other controller functions not shown) that typically write into per-IRQ descriptor entries (e.g. install a handler, set state) \u2014 i.e. the array of struct metal_irq is expected to be mutable in normal use. Because the controller code and its callers plausibly modify the irq descriptors (and the controller API uses non-const signatures to allow that), the irqs member cannot safely be changed to const without breaking intended functionality. The same reasoning applies to void *arg: it is typed as non-const to allow callers and controller code to modify or pass mutable context. Therefore, based on the provided code and the surrounding API, agent A\u2019s claim is not correct: this is not a definite violation of Rule 8.13. (If, in a particular build/configuration, it is proven that the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere, then changing the declaration to const would satisfy the rule, but that requires a whole-program analysis.)"
