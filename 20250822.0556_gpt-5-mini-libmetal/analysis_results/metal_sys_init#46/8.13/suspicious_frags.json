  "explanation": "I selected fragments that involve pointers to character data or to FILE objects which may need const qualification: the getenv() assignment and the subsequent storage into _metal.tmp_path require inspection of the type of _metal.tmp_path (it may need to be const char *). The strerror() usages passed into logging should be checked to ensure the logging API and the pointers are const-correct. The FILE *urandom declaration and its use with fopen/fread/fclose are flagged because although FILE objects typically cannot be const (stream state is modified), this should be confirmed. The open/fopen calls with string literals and the fread/fclose calls are included because they involve pointers to data whose const-qualification should be validated against the APIs used. Other fragments in the function were not flagged because: - tmp_path is declared as const char * (so its local declaration already satisfies Rule 8.13). - params is declared const in the prototype, so it conforms. - Calls that modify objects (srand, fread, fclose, IRQ init, page-size init, bus init) necessarily need non-const pointers or do not involve pointer-to-object qualifiers, so they do not implicate Rule 8.13. - String literals passed directly to standard APIs (fopen/open) are normal usage; the important question is the qualifier of the receiving/storage locations (which is why the assignment to _metal.tmp_path and uses of strerror were flagged)."
