  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter (int irq) which is only read and compared; there are no assignments to irq anywhere in the body. All other identifiers (node, cntr, irq_base, irq_end) are local variables. There are no pointer parameters to this function whose pointer value could be modified. The use of metal_container_of, the cast, and assignments to cntr/irq_base/irq_end compute values or assign to local variables only \u2014 they do not modify any function parameter. The loop iterates over a global list (&irq_cntrs) but that is unrelated to modifying a function parameter. Therefore no code fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation under that rule."
