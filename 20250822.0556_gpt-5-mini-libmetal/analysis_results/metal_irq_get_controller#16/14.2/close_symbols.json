The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'for loop shall be well-formed' you must examine the actual for statement produced by metal_list_for_each and ensure the loop counter and clauses meet the rule. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_list_for_each: The macro/function expands to the actual for(...) construct. Its three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) determine whether the loop is well-formed (which expressions are used, whether any have persistent side-effects, and which object is the loop counter). Without the expansion you cannot judge clauses or identify the loop counter.\n\n- struct metal_list: The iterator operates over metal_list nodes; the expansion will reference struct members (commonly next/prev). You need the definition to see which member is read/written in the loop clause(s) (e.g., node = node->next in the third clause) and whether other members are involved or modified.\n\n- irq_cntrs: This is the list head passed to metal_list_for_each. The expansion will compare the iterator against the head (second clause) and/or use its members. You must know its type and value semantics to ensure the second clause has no persistent side-effects and uses only the loop counter (and allowed loop control flags).\n\n- metal_container_of: Used inside the loop body to compute cntr from node. Its definition/expansion is required to verify it does not modify the loop counter (node) or other objects modified in the loop body \u2014 MISRA requires behavior of called macros/functions to be considered part of loop body behavior.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: The loop body reads cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num and accesses the node member (for container_of). You must confirm these fields are simple data accesses (no side-effects) and that the node member used by container_of matches the iterator type/member. Also checking that these accesses do not modify the loop counter.\n\n- offsetof / __builtin_offsetof: container_of implementations often use offsetof. If metal_container_of uses offsetof or similar, its definition/semantics are needed to ensure no side-effects occur and no loop-counter modification happens during evaluation.\n\nWith these symbols you can expand the macro into the concrete for(...) form, identify the loop counter, inspect each clause for side-effects or modifications of objects changed in the loop body, and determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop requirements."
