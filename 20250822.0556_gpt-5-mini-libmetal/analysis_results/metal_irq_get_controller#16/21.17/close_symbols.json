  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_irq_get_controller can violate the MISRA C rule concerning use of <string.h> functions, an analyser must inspect all macros/types/global objects that the function uses (and any code they expand/call) to ensure no standard string functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/...) are invoked or cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- metal_list_for_each: This is the loop construct used to iterate the list. It may be a macro that expands into pointer manipulations or helper calls; the definition must be checked to ensure it does not call any string.h functions or otherwise perform buffer accesses that could go out of bounds.\n- metal_container_of: Typically a macro that computes an enclosing structure pointer from a member pointer. Its expansion should be inspected (or the implementation verified) to ensure it only does pointer arithmetic/offsetof-like operations and does not call any string functions or perform memory copies that could violate the rule.\n- irq_cntrs: The global list head being iterated. Its type/initialization or any wrappers around access might hide calls to string.h functions or unsafe memory operations; confirm its definition and any accessor code do not use string functions.\n- struct metal_irq_controller: The target dereferences cntr and reads fields irq_base, irq_num and node. The full definition is needed to ensure those fields have the expected types/sizes and that accessing them cannot invoke hidden operations (e.g., if accessors/macros are used) that call string.h functions.\n- struct metal_list: The list node type used by the iteration. Its layout and any associated helper functions/macros should be checked to ensure list traversal does not invoke string.h functions or perform out-of-bounds memory accesses.\n- offsetof (or the exact definition used by metal_container_of): If metal_container_of uses offsetof or an equivalent, the exact implementation must be inspected to ensure it relies on safe pointer arithmetic and does not cause out-of-bounds accesses or hide string.h calls.\n- NULL: Included only for completeness to verify the NULL definition used in this environment (not likely to affect string.h rule), and to ensure there are no surprising macro redefinitions that could expand to code using string functions.\n\nNote: The callers listed in the static call graph (_metal_irq_set_enable, metal_irq_register) are not required to determine whether this function itself violates the MISRA <string.h> rule, because the rule concerns uses of the standard string functions inside the function (or in code it directly expands/calls). However, if you also want to prove that no string functions are reachable from callers in a broader analysis, include their definitions/callees as well."
