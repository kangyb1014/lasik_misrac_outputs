  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_irq_get_controller uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the macros and types it uses, because many common list/container macros rely on GCC extensions (for example, typeof/__typeof__ or statement-expressions ({ ... })).\n\n- metal_container_of: This macro is invoked directly in the function. Its definition must be checked for use of compiler extensions (e.g., typeof, statement-expression) or other non-standard constructs.\n- metal_list_for_each: This loop macro hides the iteration logic. Some implementations use typeof or GCC-specific tricks; its definition must be inspected to ensure it uses only standard C.\n- container_of: Many projects implement metal_container_of in terms of a generic container_of macro. If present, container_of must be inspected for typeof, ({ ... }), or other GCC extensions.\n- struct metal_irq_controller: The function reads members irq_base, irq_num and accesses member node. The definition is needed to confirm these members exist and to see whether any nonstandard language features (e.g., bit-field packing attributes, anonymous structs/unions) are used in the type.\n- struct metal_list: The iterator macro and container_of operate on this type. Its definition must be checked for use of anonymous structs/unions or other extensions.\n- irq_cntrs: This variable is the list head passed to metal_list_for_each. Its declaration (type and any initializer) should be checked for use of compiler extensions (e.g., compound literals in global initializers, nonstandard attributes) that could cause a MISRA violation.\n\nInspecting the above symbols (macro definitions and the type/variable declarations) allows the analyzer to detect uses of compiler-specific extensions such as typeof/__typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), anonymous unions/structs, or other nonstandard constructs that would violate the MISRA rule against language extensions."
