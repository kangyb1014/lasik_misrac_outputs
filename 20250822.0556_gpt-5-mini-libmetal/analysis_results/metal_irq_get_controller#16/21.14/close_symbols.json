  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to rule out hidden uses of memcmp or string comparisons inside constructs that appear in the target function: \n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro/function implementation): the loop body in the target is produced by this macro or function; we must inspect its expansion/implementation to ensure it does not call memcmp or perform any string comparisons.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro implementation): this macro extracts the containing metal_irq_controller from the list node; its expansion must be checked to ensure it does not invoke any string/comparison helpers (e.g., indirectly calling memcmp).\n\n- irq_cntrs (global variable definition/initialization): the list being iterated could be initialized or populated via code that uses memcmp when building nodes; examining its definition/initialization ensures no memcmp use is hidden in how the list or its elements are constructed.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (type definition): needed to verify the types of irq_base and irq_num (signed/unsigned/integer) and to confirm the node field layout; this demonstrates the comparisons in the function are integer bounds checks, not string comparisons.\n\n- struct metal_list (type definition): to understand what node represents and to ensure list node handling does not embed string comparison logic.\n\n- any helper macros/functions used by metal_list_for_each (iteration helpers): iteration macros often rely on other helpers (next/first); those helpers must be inspected to rule out any use of memcmp or string comparison operations.\n\nCollectively, inspecting these symbols lets the analyzer confirm that the target function's logic performs integer arithmetic and comparisons only, and does not (directly or indirectly via macros/helpers) use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
