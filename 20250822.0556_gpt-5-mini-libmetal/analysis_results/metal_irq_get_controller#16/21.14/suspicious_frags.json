  "explanation": "The provided function contains no uses of the C standard library functions (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) and performs only integer comparisons and pointer/container manipulations. Specifically:\n- There is no call to memcmp anywhere in the snippet.\n- There are no string operations or accesses of char buffers or null-terminated strings to indicate a memcmp-based string comparison.\n- The comparisons present (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end) are numeric range checks, not byte-wise or string comparisons.\n- The only macros used (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of) perform list traversal and pointer/container arithmetic; they are not shown here and do not appear as memcmp calls in this snippet.\nGiven the rule (memcmp must not be used to compare null-terminated strings), there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for that rule."
