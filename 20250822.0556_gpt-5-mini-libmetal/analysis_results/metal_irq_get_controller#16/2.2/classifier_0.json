  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_get_controller:\n```c\nstatic struct metal_irq_controller *metal_irq_get_controller(int irq)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tint irq_base, irq_end;\n\n\t\tcntr = (struct metal_irq_controller *)\n\t\t       metal_container_of(node, struct metal_irq_controller,\n\t\t\t\t\t  node);\n\t\tirq_base = cntr->irq_base;\n\t\tirq_end = irq_base + cntr->irq_num;\n\t\tif (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end) {\n\t\t\treturn cntr;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_irq_get_controller:\nstatic METAL_DECLARE_LIST(irq_cntrs)\n...\n#define metal_list_for_each(list, node) for((node)=(list)->next;(node)!=(list);(node)=(node)->next)\n...\n#define metal_container_of(ptr, structure, member) (void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final \"return NULL;\" is reached when the for-each loop does not find any controller whose range covers the given irq (i.e. no cntr satisfies irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end). It provides the necessary indication to callers that no controller was found. Removing that return would change program behaviour (callers would get an undefined return value), so the statement is not dead code."
