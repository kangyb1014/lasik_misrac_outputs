  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_device_open violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, we must inspect any code that might compare the incoming NUL-terminated strings (bus_name, dev_name). The target function itself calls metal_bus_find and then invokes bus->ops.dev_open; it does not call memcmp directly, so the likely violation sites are: (1) metal_bus_find (it may compare bus_name to stored names), (2) any dev_open implementation reachable via metal_bus->ops.dev_open (they may compare dev_name to stored names).\n\n- metal_bus_find: inspect its implementation to see whether it uses memcmp to compare bus_name with stored bus names.\n- metal_bus_register and metal_linux_bus_finish: these register/initialize bus instances and will point to the concrete bus implementations and their ops; needed to find which dev_open implementations are registered.\n- struct metal_bus and struct metal_bus_ops (including the dev_open member): to understand where and how the dev_open callback is stored/typed and to find all places that assign implementations to dev_open.\n- all functions assigned to metal_bus_ops.dev_open (bus-specific dev_open implementations): these are the functions actually called by metal_device_open; each must be scanned for memcmp used to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n- any callees of the dev_open implementations: dev_open implementations may delegate comparisons to helper functions, so those helpers must be checked as well.\n- memcmp and strlen (standard library): include these symbols to detect direct uses of memcmp for string comparisons and to identify patterns where strlen is used together with memcmp (a common misuse)."
