  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments because they either already use const-qualified pointer types, are non-pointer members, or are clearly intended to be mutable outputs/handles:\n\n- The input parameters 'const char *bus_name' and 'const char *dev_name' are already const-qualified and need no further qualification.\n- The field 'const char *name' inside struct metal_bus/struct metal_device is already const-qualified.\n- Integer and array members (num_regions, regions, irq_num) are non-pointer types and not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The metal_list members are structure instances (not shown as pointer types here) and do not present pointer-to-non-const issues in the provided snippets.\n- The device output parameter (the double pointer) and calls that assign to it are flagged above for review; other uses of that parameter elsewhere are not present in the provided code.\n- Declarations/definitions not included in the provided code (e.g., struct metal_bus_ops prototype, metal_bus_find prototype) were not flagged because their exact pointer types are not visible here; they should be reviewed where defined.\n\nThe listed fragments are those in the provided code that use non-const pointers (or pass non-const pointers) and therefore merit inspection to determine whether the pointee types could/should be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
