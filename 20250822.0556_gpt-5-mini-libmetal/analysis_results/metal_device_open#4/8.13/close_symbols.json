  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_device_open violates the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible you must know the exact pointer const-qualifications used by the types and functions it interacts with:\n\n- struct metal_bus: metal_device_open dereferences bus->ops; the concrete definition is required to see the type of the ops member and how the bus object is used (mutable vs const). If ops is declared with const qualifiers that affects whether passing bus to dev_open violates const rules.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (type of bus->ops): the ops member's type declares the function pointer types. You need this to find the dev_open member's declared parameter types (their const qualifiers).\n\n- dev_open function pointer prototype (the exact signature/type stored in bus->ops.dev_open): metal_device_open calls (*bus->ops.dev_open)(bus, dev_name, device). The const qualifiers on dev_open's parameters (especially the dev_name parameter and the device parameter) are central to the MISRA check: if dev_open expects const char * for dev_name then passing const char * is fine; if it expects struct metal_device ** (non-const) that explains why device is non-const, etc.\n\n- metal_bus_find (function prototype): metal_device_open calls metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus). You must see metal_bus_find's parameter types to verify whether passing bus_name (const char *) is consistent with metal_bus_find's expectation (e.g., const char * vs char *), and whether &bus is a non-const output (struct metal_bus **) which affects whether bus should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct metal_device: the type being returned via the output parameter device. To determine whether the pointer-to-device should be const-qualified (e.g., const struct metal_device * or not) you need the definition/expected mutability of metal_device and how callers and ops treat it.\n\n- strlen (prototype from <string.h>): the function uses strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name). The declared prototype strlen(const char *) confirms that bus_name/dev_name being const char * is appropriate; if an incompatible prototype existed it could raise const-correctness issues.\n\nThese symbols give the exact signatures and type const-qualifications needed to determine whether any pointer parameter or pointer-to-pointer in metal_device_open could/should be const-qualified and whether passing those pointers to metal_bus_find and dev_open respects const-correctness per the MISRA rule."
