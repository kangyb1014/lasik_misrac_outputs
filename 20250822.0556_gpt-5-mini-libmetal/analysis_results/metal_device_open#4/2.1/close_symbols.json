  "explanation": "- metal_bus_find: needed to know all possible return values and whether it can return a non-error while producing a bus whose ops.dev_open is NULL (affects reachability of the ENODEV branch) or whether it can always fail (affects reachability of code after the call). Also needed to see whether it can return without initializing the bus pointer.\n- struct metal_bus: required to inspect the bus layout and understand which fields (particularly ops) are valid and how they are initialized; this determines whether accesses like bus->ops.dev_open can ever be executed or are undefined/unreachable.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (bus->ops): required to know the type and semantics of the ops.dev_open pointer (e.g., whether it is optional or mandatory, its default value), which controls reachability of the if (!bus->ops.dev_open) return -ENODEV; branch.\n- metal_bus_register: one of the functions that create/register buses (appears in the static call graph). Its implementation shows how bus->ops is populated at registration time and whether a bus with a NULL dev_open can exist, which affects branch reachability.\n- metal_linux_bus_finish: another caller/initializer from the call graph; its implementation may register buses or set ops and thus influence whether certain branches in metal_device_open are reachable.\n- implementations registered into bus->ops.dev_open (all dev_open handlers): to decide whether the call (*bus->ops.dev_open)(...) can return non-zero (making the subsequent error return reachable) you must inspect actual dev_open handlers that can be installed; if all handlers always return 0 then the error-return-after-call is unreachable.\n- strlen: to confirm its semantics and that the initial NULL/empty-string checks behave as expected (ensures the first return -EINVAL branch is not provably unreachable due to some project invariant).\n- EINVAL / ENODEV macros: to identify that these are just error codes (no control-flow effects) and to ensure they are not redefined in a way that could change control flow or analysis assumptions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (implementations and initializers that set up bus and ops) is necessary to determine whether each conditional and return in metal_device_open can actually be reached in some feasible program execution; without them you cannot prove or refute that any branch is unreachable for the MISRA rule check."
