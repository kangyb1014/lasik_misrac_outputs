  "explanation": "To check the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d for metal_device_open we must be sure the function itself does not assign to its parameters (bus_name, dev_name, device) and that no callees are passed the parameter by address in a way that could modify the parameter variable itself. The listed symbols are needed for that reasoning:\n\n- strlen: need its declaration/semantics to confirm it does not modify its pointer argument (it only reads), so calls like strlen(bus_name) do not modify bus_name or dev_name.\n\n- metal_bus_find (declaration/signature): the prototype shows the parameter types. metal_device_open calls metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus) \u2014 knowing metal_bus_find's signature confirms it does not receive the address of any of metal_device_open's parameters (so it cannot modify those parameter variables).\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition, including 'ops' member): required to understand bus->ops access and to find the type of dev_open. Also needed to confirm that taking &bus (local) does not alias any function parameters.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (type of bus->ops, including dev_open member): to determine the exact type/signature of the dev_open function pointer and whether the callee could receive the address of any of metal_device_open's parameters (e.g., whether dev_open's prototype takes a pointer-to-pointer to metal_device, not a pointer-to-pointer-to-the-parameter variable itself).\n\n- dev_open function pointer (signature: int (*dev_open)(struct metal_bus *, const char *dev_name, struct metal_device **device)): the concrete signature confirms that dev_open receives device as a struct metal_device ** (a copy of the pointer value), so the callee may modify *device (the object referred to) but cannot modify the caller's local pointer variable device itself. This is central to concluding there is no modification of the parameter variable inside metal_device_open.\n\n- struct metal_device (declaration/definition): to understand what is being pointed to and to confirm that modifications to *device are modifications of the pointed-to object (allowed by the MISRA rule) rather than modifications of the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- EINVAL, ENODEV (macros/constants): included for completeness \u2014 their presence in return statements does not affect parameter modification, but having their definitions avoids false positives in some static analyses.\n\nWith these symbols one can verify that metal_device_open does not assign to its formal parameters and that the called functions cannot legally modify the parameter variables themselves (only the objects they point to), so the MISRA rule is not violated."
