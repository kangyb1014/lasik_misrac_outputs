  "explanation": "Provide the listed symbols because each can hide or introduce compiler/language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule being checked: \n\n- strlen: Need its declaration/definition (or any macro that replaces it) to ensure it is the standard library function and not a compiler builtin, macro, or otherwise non\u2011standard extension.\n\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: Need the macro definitions (errno header) to verify they are ordinary integer macros and not implemented via compiler-specific constructs or attributes.\n\n- metal_bus_find: Its prototype/definition must be inspected for any language extensions in its declaration (e.g., __attribute__, inline/asm, varargs, nonstandard calling conventions) that would affect the call in metal_device_open.\n\n- struct metal_bus: The structure definition is required to see how members (in particular ops) are declared. Struct definitions can contain anonymous unions/structs, packed/aligned attributes, or other implementation extensions.\n\n- struct metal_bus::ops: The exact type of the ops member (likely a separate ops struct) must be examined because its declaration may use extensions (anonymous members, nonstandard pointer types, function-like macros, or type attributes).\n\n- dev_open (the ops member prototype/definition): The dev_open field is invoked through a function pointer expression; its declaration/definition must be checked for attributes, calling convention extensions, nested-function usage, or macros that replace the call syntax (all potential language extensions).\n\n- struct metal_device: The target pointer type should be checked for any nonstandard features in its definition (e.g., compiler attributes, bit-field or unnamed/extension constructs) that would be relevant to correct, standards\u2011conforming use.\n\n- any macros that redefine strlen or dev_open (preprocessor symbols): Preprocessor redefinitions or wrapper macros can hide compiler extensions (e.g., replacing a call with a statement expression, builtin, or inline asm). Inspect relevant headers and macros to ensure no extension is used.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their prototypes/definitions and relevant headers) lets the analyst determine whether the code in metal_device_open relies on any compiler/language extensions (attributes, builtins, macros, nested functions, non\u2011standard calling conventions, inline asm, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
