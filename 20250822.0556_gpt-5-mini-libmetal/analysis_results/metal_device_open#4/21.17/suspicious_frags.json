  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. In the provided code the only uses of <string.h> functions occur in the two reported fragments (strlen in the input-parameter validation and strcmp in metal_bus_find). No other lines in the shown code invoke string.h functions, so they do not need investigation under this rule. Other operations (pointer checks, error returns, bus lookup loop, calling bus->ops.dev_open) do not directly use string.h functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 for this snippet."
