  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional constructs are:\n- if (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n- the conditional operator in io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\nBoth expressions depend on function parameters (page_shift, ops) and are evaluated once; they are not constant/invariant controlling expressions in the sense of MISRA C Rule 14.3 (which targets invariant loop/decision conditions). There are no loops (while, for, do-while) with compile-time constant controls or other manifestly invariant controlling expressions, and none of the allowed exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the specific do-while constant-false pattern) apply. Therefore there are no fragments requiring further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
