  "explanation": "No code in the provided function calls any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The function only performs pointer and integer assignments, a safe structure copy (io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops; \u2014 not a string operation), and a guarded bit-shift computation that prevents overflow. Therefore there are no in-function fragments that could directly violate Rule 21.17. The only external call is metal_sys_io_mem_map(io); if any string-handling occurs, it would be inside that function (not shown) and should be inspected separately. No other lines here perform buffer accesses via standard string routines or otherwise indicate potential out-of-bounds string handling."
