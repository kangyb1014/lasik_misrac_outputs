  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is reassigned in this function. All assignments write to members of the object pointed to by the pointer parameter 'io' (e.g. io->virt = virt; io->physmap = physmap; io->size = size; io->page_shift = page_shift; io->page_mask = ...; io->mem_flags = mem_flags; io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule; the rule prohibits changing the pointer parameter itself (e.g. io = ..., virt = ..., physmap = ..., size = ..., page_shift = ..., mem_flags = ..., ops = ...), and no such assignments occur. The temporary local 'nops' is a local object and using *ops copies the pointed-to struct without modifying the pointer parameter. The call metal_sys_io_mem_map(io) passes the pointer but does not reassign any parameter in this function. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
