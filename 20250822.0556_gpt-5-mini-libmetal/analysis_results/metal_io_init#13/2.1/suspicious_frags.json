  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function are simple, unconditional field assignments (io->virt = virt; io->physmap = physmap; io->size = size; io->page_shift = page_shift; io->mem_flags = mem_flags;) which are executed in sequence and cannot themselves be unreachable. The function header, parameter list and return type are syntactically required and not unreachable code. The nops initializer, the page_mask conditional, the ops assignment and the final call are the only locations where control flow or conditional selection could produce code paths that are never taken (or where a branch might be impossible given external constraints), so those fragments should be investigated for potential unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1."
