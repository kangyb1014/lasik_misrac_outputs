  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided code is invariant. The only conditional is:\n\nif (irq < cntr->irq_base || irq >= (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num)) {\n    return;\n}\n\nwhich depends on the runtime values irq, cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num, so it is not an invariant controlling expression and does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no loops in metal_softirq_set; the atomic_store call is not a controlling expression.\n\nThe additional line is a macro invocation (METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE(...)). The macro itself is not expanded in the provided code, so no concrete invariant controlling expression is visible here. Common macro patterns (for example do { ... } while (0)) would expand to a do-while with a constant false controlling expression; such a do-while with an essentially Boolean constant false is explicitly allowed by the Rule 14.3 exceptions. Infinite-loop constants would also be an allowed exception. Therefore, based on the supplied source fragments, there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to investigate."
