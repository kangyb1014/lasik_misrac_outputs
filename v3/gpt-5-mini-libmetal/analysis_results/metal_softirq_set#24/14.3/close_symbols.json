  "explanation": "- metal_softirq_cntr: the global object whose address is taken as cntr. You must see its definition/initializer and qualifiers (const/volatile/static) to know whether cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num can vary at run time or are invariant. If this object (or its fields) is effectively constant, the if expression could become invariant.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (complete definition): the struct type is needed to determine the types and qualifiers of its members (irq_base, irq_num). The signedness, width and any const/volatile qualifiers of these fields affect whether the comparison is a compile-time/always-same result or depends on run-time state.\n\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_base (field declaration/qualifiers): the controlling expression uses cntr->irq_base. You need its declaration to know if it is a compile-time constant, const-qualified, volatile, or otherwise unmodifiable (which would influence whether the if condition can be invariant).\n\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_num (field declaration/qualifiers): same reason as irq_base \u2014 the expression uses (cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num). Knowing irq_num\u2019s type and qualifiers is required to decide if that subexpression is invariant.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending (declaration/type/size): while not part of the if condition, its declaration (element type, e.g. atomic type, and size) is useful to understand indexing and any macro/aliasing rules that could change evaluation semantics; also to check whether index computation or array aliasing could produce undefined behaviour that affects expression analysis.\n\n- atomic_store (definition/macro/implementation): the function/macro implementation may reveal hidden side-effects or macros that expand to code touching globals used in the if expression. Even though atomic_store is called after the if, its definition can affect how analysis treats concurrency and modifiability of the controller fields (e.g. if atomic operations are used elsewhere to modify cntr fields)."
