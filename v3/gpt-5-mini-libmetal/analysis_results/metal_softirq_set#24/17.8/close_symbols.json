  "explanation": "metal_softirq_cntr: the global object whose address is taken and assigned to local pointer cntr. You must see its declaration (type and linkage) to confirm that cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num are ordinary data fields and not macros or accessor functions that could alter the parameter.\n\nstruct metal_irq_controller: the structure definition (and types of the members irq_base and irq_num). Knowing member types is necessary to understand the arithmetic and bounds checks (and to rule out any unusual operator overloads or macro redefinitions in C that could hide side effects). This supports the determination that the statement \"irq -= cntr->irq_base;\" modifies the integer parameter itself.\n\nmetal_softirq_pending: the array (or object) being indexed with irq. Its declaration and element type are needed to check how it is used in atomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1) and to ensure that indexing does not imply any hidden modification to the parameter (for example via a strange macro-based implementation).\n\natomic_store: the declaration/definition (function or macro) for atomic_store. If atomic_store is a macro it might evaluate its arguments multiple times or perform unexpected side effects. To conclude whether the parameter irq is modified (directly by \"irq -= ...\" or indirectly via an evaluated expression passed to atomic_store), the exact definition/signature of atomic_store must be known."
