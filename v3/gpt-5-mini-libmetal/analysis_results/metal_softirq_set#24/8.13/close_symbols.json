  "explanation": "struct metal_irq_controller: needed to see the member types and whether any members are declared with qualifiers (const/volatile) or contain pointers/objects that require non-const access. This determines whether the local pointer 'cntr' could/should be a pointer-to-const. \n\nmetal_softirq_cntr: needed to know the declared qualifiers of the actual object (&metal_softirq_cntr). If the global is already const-qualified (or volatile), that affects whether a non-const pointer is appropriate and whether taking a const pointer would be compatible.\n\nmetal_softirq_pending: needed to know the element type and any qualifiers (e.g., _Atomic, volatile, const). The code takes the address of an element to pass to atomic_store; the element type and its qualifiers determine whether a pointer-to-const could be used or whether a non-const pointer is required.\n\natomic_store: the prototype/signature (parameter types and their const-qualification) is required to determine whether passing &metal_softirq_pending[irq] requires a pointer to non-const (i.e., atomic_store expects a pointer to a mutable atomic object) or could accept a pointer-to-const. This affects whether any pointer involved must be non-const and whether the function violates the MISRA guideline."
