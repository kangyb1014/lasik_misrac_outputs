It could be 'const struct metal_irq_controller *cntr = &metal_softirq_cntr;'. Therefore, unless other code (not shown) requires a mutable pointer, this use violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "explanation": "Agent A's assessment is correct given the presented code. In metal_softirq_set the local pointer cntr is only used to read members (irq_base, irq_num) and never to modify the object it points to. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible; therefore cntr should be declared as a pointer to const (for example: const struct metal_irq_controller *cntr = &metal_softirq_cntr;).\n\nCaveats: if there are unseen reasons why cntr must be used to modify the controller (or the controller members are declared volatile and require a const volatile qualifier), or if other code relies on cntr being non-const, then adding const might be inappropriate. Based solely on the provided snippet, however, the report is correct and the pointer should be const-qualified."
