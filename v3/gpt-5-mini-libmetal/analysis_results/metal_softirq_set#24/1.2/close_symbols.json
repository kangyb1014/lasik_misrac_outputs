  "explanation": "To determine if metal_softirq_set uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect all referenced symbols whose declarations/implementations could introduce extensions. Specifically:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: the global object referenced by the function. Its declaration may carry attributes, non-standard storage-class specifiers, or be defined in an extension-heavy file; you must see its declaration to know if any extension is used.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition): the function reads members irq_base and irq_num. The struct definition reveals member types and any non-standard constructs (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, compiler attributes, packed/unaligned annotations, or other extensions) that would affect whether the code uses language extensions.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending: the array the function writes into. You need the declaration to see its element type and linkage; the array element type determines whether standard or non\u2011standard atomic or kernel-specific atomics are used.\n\n- type/typedef of elements of metal_softirq_pending: whether the elements are C11 _Atomic<T>, a custom typedef like atomic_t, or some compiler-specific type changes the analysis. C11 _Atomic is standard; custom types or typedefs that map to compiler builtins (e.g. wrappers around __atomic or __sync intrinsics) could be language extensions.\n\n- atomic_store (declaration and its full definition/implementation/macro expansion): this is the critical symbol. atomic_store might be the C11 library function/macro or it might be a project wrapper that expands to compiler builtins (e.g. __atomic_store_n, __sync_synchronize) or inline assembly. You must examine the actual declaration/definition or macro expansion to determine whether a compiler-specific extension is used.\n\n- header(s) or source file(s) that provide the atomic APIs/macros (e.g. stdatomic.h or project atomic wrapper header): knowing which header supplies atomic_store/atomic types will show whether the code relies purely on standard headers (C11) or on vendor/project headers that employ compiler extensions. The header may also define macros that hide extension usage.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyzer trace whether the atomic operation and the data types are expressed in standard C or implemented via compiler-specific extensions; it also reveals any non-standard attributes or constructs on the controller or globals that would violate the MISRA rule against language extensions."
