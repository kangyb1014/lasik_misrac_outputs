This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA string-bound analysis:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr: The function indexes and bounds-check against cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num coming from this global instance. You must see its definition/initialization to know actual types/values and whether those fields can cause an out-of-bounds index into metal_softirq_pending.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: The field types (irq_base, irq_num) and their signedness/width affect the comparison and arithmetic (irq -= cntr->irq_base). Knowing the exact types is necessary to determine whether integer wrapping or promotions could lead to an out-of-range index that then accesses metal_softirq_pending out-of-bounds.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending: The declaration (array/pointer, element type, and size) is required to determine the valid index range and check whether the computed irq index can exceed the bounds. If this symbol is a pointer rather than a fixed-size array, additional indirections or allocation details are needed.\n\n- atomic_store: The implementation or macro for atomic_store must be inspected because the MISRA rule targets use of string.h functions. On some platforms or abstractions atomic_store may be implemented via helper routines that internally call memcpy/memmove/memset (or macros that map to those). You must inspect atomic_store to confirm it does not invoke any string.h functions that could access beyond object bounds.\n\n- type/typedef of metal_softirq_pending elements (e.g. atomic type): If the array elements are of an atomic wrapper type (typedef, struct), their representation and any copy/store semantics may cause underlying memcpy/memmove usage. You need the definition to see whether atomic_store is a simple compiler intrinsic or a wrapper that copies bytes via string functions.\n\n- header/implementation that defines atomic_store and the atomic type (e.g. stdatomic.h or project atomic abstraction): Knowing which header/implementation supplies atomic_store lets you locate the exact implementation used in the build (C11 stdatomic, compiler builtin, or project fallback). That implementation determines whether string.h functions are invoked.\n\n- any macro/inline that maps atomic_store to memcpy/memmove/memset or other string.h functions: Explicitly check for project macros or inlines that replace atomic_store with calls to memcpy/memmove/memset. If such mapping exists, you must inspect the call sites and arguments to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine (1) whether the index arithmetic can produce an out-of-bounds access into metal_softirq_pending and (2) whether any called/expanded routines (notably atomic_store) use string.h functions that could perform out-of-bounds memory operations."
