  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions appears in the provided code fragments. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically targets standard string-handling calls such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc., and none of these are present in metal_softirq_set or the related definitions shown. The only array access is metal_softirq_pending[irq], which is guarded by a runtime range check (irq compared to cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_base + cntr->irq_num) and then normalized with irq -= cntr->irq_base, so there is no indication of a string-handling out-of-bounds issue to investigate under Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments for this rule in the supplied code."
