  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_probe_bus can result in out-of-bounds accesses via string.h functions you must inspect all symbols that touch or propagate string/buffer data reachable from this function.\n\n- struct linux_bus: The probe uses lbus->bus_name, lbus->sbus and lbus->bus. You need the layout (types and buffer sizes) of these fields to know whether any string operations can overflow them.\n- struct linux_driver: The loop iterates drivers (ldrv) and passes them into probe routines. Driver fields (names, buffers) may be used by downstream code that invokes string functions; their definitions are required to reason about sizes and bounds.\n- sysfs_open_bus: Called with lbus->bus_name; its implementation may call string functions (copy/concat) on bus_name or allocate buffers derived from it. Its code is needed to check for unsafe string handling or assumptions about bus_name length.\n- for_each_linux_driver (macro/iterator): The iteration mechanism determines which driver objects are passed to metal_linux_probe_driver and whether any pointer arithmetic or indexing could produce out-of-bounds access when driver data is used by string functions.\n- metal_linux_probe_driver: Direct callee inside the loop. Its implementation may call string.h functions on data from lbus or ldrv; inspect it for potential out-of-bounds uses and for assumptions about buffer sizes.\n- metal_linux_bus_close: Called on error; its implementation may manipulate string/buffer fields (cleanup, copy, free). You must inspect it for string function usage that could be unsafe.\n- to_linux_bus: metal_linux_bus_close calls this; its implementation may expose or transform internal buffers or pointers. Its code is needed to follow any string operations on those buffers.\n- metal_linux_register_bus: Called at end; its implementation may copy or register bus names (string operations). Inspect it for uses of string.h functions and buffer-size assumptions.\n- metal_bus_register: Called by metal_linux_register_bus; follow this to any string operations that consume lbus->bus_name or related buffers.\n- Any transitive callees that call string.h functions (listed examples): MISRA rule applies specifically to standard string functions. If any of the above functions (or their transitive callees) invoke strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strspn/strdup, you must inspect their call sites, argument values, and buffer sizes to determine possible out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations) lets the analyzer trace where string-handling occurs, the buffers involved, their allocated sizes, and whether the calls respect bounds \u2014 which is required to decide compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule."
