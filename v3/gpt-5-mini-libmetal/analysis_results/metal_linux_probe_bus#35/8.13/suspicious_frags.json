  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types or clearly modify the pointed-to object so const-qualification would be inappropriate. Examples: the integer locals (ret, error) and numerical/error-handling expressions are not pointer-related; the assignment lbus->sbus = sysfs_open_bus(lbus->bus_name) writes into the bus structure (the object is being modified), so making the lbus pointer or its members const would be incorrect; conditional checks and return statements do not affect pointer qualification. The only places that could plausibly require const-qualified pointer types are the pointer declarations/usages listed in suspicious_frags above."
