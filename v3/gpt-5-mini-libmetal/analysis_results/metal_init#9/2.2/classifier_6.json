Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_init:\n```c\nint metal_init(const struct metal_init_params *params)\n{\n\tint error = 0;\n\n\tif (_metal.common.ref_count++ != 0)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\n\tmemset(&_metal, 0, sizeof(_metal));\n\n\t_metal.common.log_handler   = params->log_handler;\n\t_metal.common.log_level     = params->log_level;\n\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.bus_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_device_list);\n\n\terror = metal_sys_init(params);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\t++_metal.common.ref_count;\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemset(&_metal, 0, sizeof(_metal));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The memset(&_metal, 0, sizeof(_metal)) is not dead. It zeroes the whole _metal object (clearing the side-effect of the earlier post-increment and initializing other fields). If it were removed the behaviour would change: with initial _metal.common.ref_count == 0, the current code yields a final ref_count of 1 (post-initialize), but removing the memset would leave the earlier increment in place and the later ++_metal.common.ref_count would make ref_count == 2. Also other members would remain uninitialized instead of being cleared. Therefore the operation affects program behaviour and does not violate Rule 2.2."
