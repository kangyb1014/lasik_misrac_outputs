  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_init:\n```c\nint metal_init(const struct metal_init_params *params)\n{\n\tint error = 0;\n\n\tif (_metal.common.ref_count++ != 0)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\n\tmemset(&_metal, 0, sizeof(_metal));\n\n\t_metal.common.log_handler   = params->log_handler;\n\t_metal.common.log_level     = params->log_level;\n\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.bus_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list);\n\tmetal_list_init(&_metal.common.generic_device_list);\n\n\terror = metal_sys_init(params);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\t++_metal.common.ref_count;\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nerror = metal_sys_init(params);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment error = metal_sys_init(params); is used (its result is tested immediately after and returned), and the call likely has side effects (system initialization). Removing the call or the assignment would therefore change program behaviour. (It would be dead only in the hypothetical case that metal_sys_init has no side effects and its return value is irrelevant/constant, which is not provable from the fragment.)"
