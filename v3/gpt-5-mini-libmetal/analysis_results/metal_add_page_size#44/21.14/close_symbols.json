  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_add_page_size violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must know any symbols the function uses or that could perform hidden memcmp-based string comparisons.\n\n- strncpy: the function calls strncpy; confirm its semantics (it does not compare strings using memcmp) and how it handles termination/truncation.\n- PATH_MAX: needed to know the destination buffer limit used by strncpy and whether truncation can occur (affects whether strings remain null-terminated).\n- _metal (type/definition): to inspect the page_sizes array and understand member types/sizes and whether any accessor could trigger string comparisons.\n- _metal.page_sizes[].path (member and its declared size): to verify the buffer into which strncpy copies the path, ensure correct size and null-termination behavior (relevant to whether later code might use memcmp incorrectly on possibly non-terminated data).\n- _metal.page_sizes[].page_shift, .page_size, .mmap_flags: included to fully understand the struct fields touched (ensures no hidden string ops or wrappers operate on these members).\n- _metal.num_page_sizes: to verify index bounds logic and that no out-of-bounds writes could create non-terminated strings that might later be compared with memcmp.\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES: for the bounds check that prevents overflow of page_sizes (relevant to buffer safety and string termination).\n- metal_log: called from this function; must check whether this logging function (or any logging helpers it calls) uses memcmp on null-terminated strings internally.\n- memcmp: include the symbol itself so the analyzer can check whether this function or any called functions (e.g., metal_log or other referenced functions) use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- EOVERFLOW, EINVAL: error codes used by the function (not directly related to memcmp) but included for completeness to understand early returns and control flow that might avoid or cause comparisons.\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING, METAL_LOG_DEBUG: logging levels passed to metal_log; included so the analyzer can trace logging paths (and any string handling inside logging) if needed.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary context to verify (1) that metal_add_page_size itself does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings, (2) that the buffer handling (strncpy + PATH_MAX + struct member sizes) does not produce unterminated strings that could later be incorrectly compared, and (3) that none of the invoked helpers (notably metal_log) use memcmp in a way that would violate the MISRA rule."
