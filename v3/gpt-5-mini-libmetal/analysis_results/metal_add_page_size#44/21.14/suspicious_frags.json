  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp (or any other standard-library comparison used on null-terminated strings) are present in the provided function or the related macro snippet. The only string operation in metal_add_page_size is strncpy(), which copies rather than compares, so it is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The metal_log macro and its expansion shown do not call memcmp either. Therefore there are no code fragments in the given code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used elsewhere in the project, those translation units would need to be checked, but they are outside the provided code.)"
