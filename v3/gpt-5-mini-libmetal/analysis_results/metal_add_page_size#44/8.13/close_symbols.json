  "explanation": "To decide whether the function violates the MISRA rule \u201ca pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d you must know the exact types and const-qualification of all pointer objects used here. Specifically:\n- _metal (global variable and its type): needed to see how the page_sizes container and its members are declared (pointer vs array, const qualifiers).\n- definition of the page-size element type: reveals the declarations of page_shift, page_size, mmap_flags and, crucially, the path member (whether it is char *, char [], const char *, etc.). That determines whether the code writes through a pointer that should/should not be const.\n- _metal.page_sizes[].path declaration: directly relevant \u2014 if path is declared as (non-const) char * or as char[N] or as const char *; knowing this tells if writing into it via strncpy is valid and whether it should be const-qualified.\n- PATH_MAX macro: if path is an array sized with PATH_MAX (char path[PATH_MAX]), PATH_MAX gives the array size and confirms that path is an array (not a pointer). This affects whether the member is a pointer that could/should be const.\n- strncpy prototype: the parameter const-qualification (char *dest, const char *src, size_t n) matters to check that passing 'path' (const char *) as source is allowed and that the destination is non-const. Confirms whether the use of strncpy requires removing constness anywhere.\n- metal_log prototype: needed to verify how path is passed to the logger (whether the function expects a const char * for %s or a non-const pointer) and to ensure no implicit cast removes const-qualification.\n\nWith these symbols available an analyst can determine (1) whether any pointer in the function is declared without const when it could be const, (2) whether the code incorrectly writes through pointers that should be const, and (3) whether any calls cause implicit removal of const qualification."
