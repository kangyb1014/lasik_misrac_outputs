  "explanation": "Other lines in the function do not call string.h functions and do not perform pointer-based string operations, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The index check (if (index >= MAX_PAGE_SIZES)) prevents out-of-bounds access of the _metal.page_sizes array; the null check (if (!path || shift <= 0)) prevents a NULL path being used; the numeric assignments and increment of _metal.num_page_sizes are simple scalar operations not involving string handling. The other metal_log calls only format numeric values and do not risk string-buffer reads. No other uses of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar string.h functions appear in this function."
