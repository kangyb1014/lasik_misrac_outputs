  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs and library calls: a static function, integer arithmetic and shifts, standard library strncpy, standard macros (PATH_MAX), and ordinary control flow and return values. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ or __asm__ tokens, __builtin_* functions, inline assembly, extended integer types (e.g. __int128), or other compiler-specific keywords or pragmas. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions). Note: other potential issues (format specifier vs. unsigned long, strncpy null-termination, reserved identifier usage) are not language extensions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 1.2."
