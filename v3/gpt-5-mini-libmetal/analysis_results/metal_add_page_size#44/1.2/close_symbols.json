  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions you must inspect symbols that could themselves be defined using non-standard/implementation-specific features or that influence use of non-standard facilities:\n\n- _metal (global variable) and its struct/type definition: the global declaration may include compiler-specific extensions (attributes, packed, __extension__, flexible-array members, reserved-identifier issues). You must see the actual type to detect any non-standard constructs used in its definition.\n\n- type of _metal.page_sizes[] element (page_shift, page_size, mmap_flags, path): the element type may use non-standard field types or attributes, and the path member size and type determine whether strncpy use is safe/standard. Inspecting these fields shows whether any language extensions are used in those definitions.\n\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES (macro): the macro definition could use compiler extensions (e.g., typeof, __builtin_constant_p, statement expressions) \u2014 inspect it to ensure it is a standard constant macro.\n\n- metal_log (function or macro) and METAL_LOG_WARNING / METAL_LOG_DEBUG: metal_log may be a macro or function implemented with compiler extensions (variadic macros, GCC format attributes, __attribute__, or non-standard printf-like handling). Examine its declaration/definition to spot any language extensions.\n\n- EOVERFLOW and EINVAL and errno.h: these error macros are historically POSIX definitions (not all are guaranteed by ISO C). You need to know whether they come from standard C or an extension in this environment to judge use of non-standard facilities.\n\n- PATH_MAX and limits.h: PATH_MAX is a POSIX/implementation-defined constant (not strictly ISO C). Its presence/definition may indicate use of non-standard headers/constants; check its origin.\n\n- strncpy and string.h: confirm strncpy is the standard library function (and not a project-specific inline/extension) and that its prototype is the standard one \u2014 to ensure no extension is used for the copy operation.\n\n- mmap-related flags/type (mmap_flags) and the header that defines them (e.g., sys/mman.h): mmap flags and their definitions are platform-specific (POSIX) and may be non-standard; inspect their definitions to determine whether the code relies on non-standard constructs.\n\nOnly after examining these symbols/headers can you conclude whether the function itself or the types/macros it uses employ language/compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
