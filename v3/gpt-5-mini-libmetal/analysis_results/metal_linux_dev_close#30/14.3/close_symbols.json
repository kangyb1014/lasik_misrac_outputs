  "explanation": "to_linux_device \u2014 may be a macro or inline cast (e.g., container_of). If it expands inline into this function it could introduce controlling expressions (macros sometimes use do/while or conditionals). We must inspect its definition to see if any invariant controlling expression is injected.\n\nto_linux_bus \u2014 same reason as to_linux_device: could be a macro/inline that expands into code with control expressions; check its definition.\n\nmetal_list_del \u2014 very likely a macro wrapping list manipulation (possibly a do { ... } while(0) or conditional). Macros can introduce controlling expressions (including constant ones). Its expansion must be checked for invariant controlling expressions and whether any do-while(0) uses the allowed exception.\n\nlist_del \u2014 often the underlying primitive used by metal_list_del. If metal_list_del forwards to list_del (or similar), inspect list_del implementation/macro; it is a common source of macros with controlling expressions.\n\ncontainer_of \u2014 common helper used by to_linux_* macros; if used, its definition (macro) must be checked for any control statements or do/while constructs that would become part of this function when expanded.\n\nstruct linux_device \u2014 needed to know whether access ldev->ldrv is direct or involves inline helper macros, and to confirm that dev_close is a function pointer (vs. macro) and therefore not expanding control-flow into this function.\n\nstruct linux_bus \u2014 included because lbus is passed to dev_close; its definition will reveal if any inline semantics/macros are involved in producing lbus from bus.\n\nstruct linux_driver \u2014 required to determine the type of ldrv->dev_close (function pointer vs. macro/inline). If dev_close is a macro or inline function, its code could introduce controlling expressions into the caller when expanded; if it is a plain function pointer call, then its internal control flow does not affect whether this caller violates the rule.\n\nstruct metal_device \u2014 needed to inspect the node member type and to confirm whether accessing device->node involves any macros or inline helpers that could introduce control expressions.\n\nRationale: The target function itself has no explicit controlling statements, so the only way invariant controlling expressions could appear in the caller is via macros or inline expansions of the symbols above. To determine compliance with MISRA C controlling-expression rules we must inspect those macro/inline definitions and the types that determine whether calls are indirect (function pointer) or macros/inlines that could inject control-flow into the target function."
