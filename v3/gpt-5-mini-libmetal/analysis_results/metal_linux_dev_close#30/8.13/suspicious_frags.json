  "explanation": "Lines not listed as suspicious should not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because they involve operations that inherently require mutable (non-const) access or are not pointer declarations that could reasonably be const-qualified: metal_list_del(&device->node); modifies the device's list node (requires a non-const pointer). free(ldev); deallocates memory and thus operates on a mutable pointer (free takes void *). The remaining statements are simple uses of those pointers or macro/conversion helpers whose pointer types are already captured by the included declarations/call; any const-qualification concerns for those helpers are covered by examining the listed pointer declarations and their use in the dev_close call."
