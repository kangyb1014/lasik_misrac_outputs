  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 not necessarily violated. The fragment initializes a non-const pointer from a non-const parameter and immediately passes it to ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev). Without the prototype of dev_close or evidence that lbus is only read, you cannot assume it could be const. This is therefore not a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. (A violation would exist if lbus and all callees only read the object and the pointer could have been declared as const struct linux_bus *.)"
