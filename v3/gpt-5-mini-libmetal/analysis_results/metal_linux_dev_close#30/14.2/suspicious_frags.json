First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. I examined all provided code fragments: the function metal_linux_dev_close, the helper functions to_linux_device and to_linux_bus, and the struct definitions for linux_device, linux_bus and metal_device. None of these fragments contain any for statements (no for (...) constructs), so Rule 14.2 is not directly applicable to the provided code.\n\nNotes on why other pieces were not reported:\n- metal_linux_dev_close: contains function calls, a list deletion and a free, but no for loop.\n- to_linux_device and to_linux_bus: single return statements using a container_of-style macro; no for loops.\n- struct definitions (linux_device, linux_bus, metal_device): declarations of members and arrays but no executable for statements.\n- Indirect calls (ldev->ldrv->dev_close): the body of dev_close is not provided. If that implementation contains for statements, it should be inspected separately for compliance with Rule 14.2; however it is outside the supplied code and therefore not reported here.\n\nConclusion: No suspicious code fragments related to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 are present in the supplied code. If you can provide implementations of functions called (e.g., dev_close) or additional source files, I can re-check those for for-loop issues."
