  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.2 concerns functions calling themselves directly or indirectly. The only program points inside this function that can invoke other functions (and thus potentially create direct or indirect recursion) are the function-call expressions. I have therefore listed every call-site present in the function. Other fragments in the code are only declarations, pointer dereferences or assignments and do not perform calls themselves, so they cannot by themselves introduce recursion and do not need further investigation."
