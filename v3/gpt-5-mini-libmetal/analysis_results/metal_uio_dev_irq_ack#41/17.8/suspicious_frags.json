  "explanation": "No code fragments modify any of the function parameters (lbus, ldev, irq), so none need investigation for Rule 17.8. Specific reasons:\n- The casts (void)lbus; and (void)irq; only mark parameters as intentionally unused; they do not assign to or alter the parameters.\n- There is no assignment to lbus, ldev, or irq anywhere (no statements like ldev = ..., lbus = ..., irq = ...), and no pointer arithmetic applied to the pointer parameters.\n- Accesses such as ldev->fd read or use the object referred to by the pointer parameter; Rule 17.8 explicitly allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter, provided the pointer itself is not modified. In this code ldev is only dereferenced to obtain fd and not reassigned.\n- The read call writes into the local variable val ((void *)&val), not into any parameter. The write call sends the address of the local irq_info variable; again this does not modify any parameter.\n- No function is called with the address of a parameter (no &lbus or &ldev), so there is no indirect modification of the pointer parameters via pointer-to-pointer.\nGiven the above, there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
