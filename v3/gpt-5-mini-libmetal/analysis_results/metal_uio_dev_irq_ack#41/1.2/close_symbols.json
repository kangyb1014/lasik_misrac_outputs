  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for compiler language extensions:\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - The function accesses ldev->fd. You must see the definition to confirm the field type and to detect any nonstandard/implementation-specific attributes/macros (for example GCC __attribute__ annotations, packed/aligned keywords, compiler-specific bit-field usage) that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - Even though lbus is cast away, its definition may include compiler-specific constructs or annotations. Checking its definition ensures no usage of compiler extensions hidden in the type declaration.\n\n- read (declaration/definition)\n  - The call to read may rely on an implicit declaration (allowed in older C dialects but forbidden/treated as an extension by modern compilers/MISRA). Also read is a POSIX API (not ISO C); you must verify whether the code includes a standard prototype or a platform-specific wrapper/macro that uses compiler extensions (inline asm, attributes, syscall wrappers). Determining whether use of read implies a compiler/library extension requires the read prototype/definition.\n\n- write (declaration/definition)\n  - Same reasons as read: need to see its declaration to detect implicit declaration usage, platform-specific wrappers, or compiler-specific attributes/macros that would be language extensions.\n\n- errno (macro/definition)\n  - errno is typically a macro that can expand to a function call (e.g., __errno_location()) or other implementation-specific entity. Its implementation can use compiler extensions; to decide if the code uses a language extension via errno you must see how errno is defined in the target build environment.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition)\n  - This logging function/macro could be implemented using compiler-specific extensions (variadic macro extensions, statement expressions, GCC attributes, variadic-argument forwarding using nonstandard constructs, etc.). Inspecting its declaration/definition is required to determine whether the call in the target function uses or triggers compiler extensions.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum/definition)\n  - If this is a macro it might expand using compiler-specific features. Even if an enum/const, its definition could involve conditional macros that use extensions. You need the symbol to verify the logging call does not rely on language extensions.\n\n- __func__\n  - __func__ is standardized in C99 but historically provided as a compiler extension (and compilers also offer similar nonstandard identifiers like __FUNCTION__). To decide whether use of __func__ in this code constitutes a language extension in the target build, the build/compiler support must be checked; include the symbol/usage to confirm whether it is provided by the standard or as a compiler extension in the environment.\n\nNote: The goal is to identify constructs that may come from compiler-specific or platform-specific definitions (implicit declarations, macros, attributes, inline asm, statement expressions, nonstandard predefined identifiers). The listed symbols are the minimal set whose definitions (or the headers that define them) must be inspected to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions."
