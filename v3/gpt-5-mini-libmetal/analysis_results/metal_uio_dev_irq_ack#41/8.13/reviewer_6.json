If this member is intended only to reference existing sysfs_attribute objects without modifying them (i.e. it is used read-only), it should be declared as 'const struct sysfs_attribute *override;'.

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not supported by the code shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. However, whether the declaration \"struct sysfs_attribute *override;\" violates the rule depends on how that member is used elsewhere: if the code writes through override (or assigns non-const pointers to it or passes it to APIs requiring a non-const pointer) then the non-const declaration is required and there is no violation. The provided snippets do not show any use sites of override, and the reported target function metal_uio_dev_irq_ack does not reference that member at all. Because no evidence is given that override is only used read\u2011only, we cannot conclude that a const qualification is possible or required. Therefore the report as stated is not correct (insufficient evidence to claim a Rule 8.13 violation)."
