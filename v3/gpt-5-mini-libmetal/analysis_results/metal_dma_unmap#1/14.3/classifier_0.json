  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression 'dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R' is not invariant because it depends on the runtime parameter 'dir'. Rule 14.3 would be violated if the condition were a compile-time constant (e.g. 'if (METAL_DMA_DEV_R)' or 'if (1)') rather than comparing a variable to a constant."
