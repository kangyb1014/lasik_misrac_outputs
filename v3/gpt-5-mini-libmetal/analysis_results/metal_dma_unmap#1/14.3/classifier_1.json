  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression is not invariant: it depends on the function parameters (dev, sg) and the runtime value of dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap, so it can evaluate differently on different calls. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated. (A violating scenario would be using a constant controlling expression such as if (1) or if (0) or a macro that always expands to a compile-time constant.)"
