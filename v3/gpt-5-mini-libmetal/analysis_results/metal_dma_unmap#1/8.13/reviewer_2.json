According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, pointers that point to data that is not modified should be declared to point to const-qualified types. In this declaration 'sg_in' should be 'const struct metal_sg *sg_in' (and the function-pointer type in struct metal_bus_ops must be updated accordingly). Other pointers (e.g. device, bus, sg_out) may legitimately be non-const if they are intended to be modified.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_unmap:\nstruct metal_bus_ops {\n\tvoid\t\t(*bus_close)(struct metal_bus *bus);\n\tint\t\t(*dev_open)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t    const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t\t    struct metal_device **device);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_close)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_irq_ack)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t       int irq);\n\tint\t\t(*dev_dma_map)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t       uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t\t       int nents_in,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_sg *sg_out);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_dma_unmap)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t\t struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t\t uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t\t struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t\t int nents);\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 says a pointer parameter should be to a const-qualified type if the pointed-to object is not modified. In this example metal_dma_unmap simply forwards the sg pointer to the bus op dev_dma_unmap, and the bus-op prototype in struct metal_bus_ops already declares a non-const struct metal_sg * parameter. That non-const API signature permits (and likely intends) that the bus implementation may modify the SG list (or at least is not constrained not to). Without evidence that the pointed-to objects are never modified by any implementation of dev_dma_unmap, you cannot conclude the pointer \u201cshould\u201d be const. To remove the reported violation safely one would need to change the API (struct metal_bus_ops) and all implementations so that the parameter is const, but as it stands the code does not violate 8.13 because the interface explicitly uses a non-const pointer."
