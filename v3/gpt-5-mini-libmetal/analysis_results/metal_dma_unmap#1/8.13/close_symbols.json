  "explanation": "- struct metal_device (definition): needed to know the exact type of the 'dev' parameter and its members (in particular the 'bus' field). If fields are const-qualified in the definition or if the function writes into device members, that affects whether the incoming pointer can/should be const.\n- struct metal_bus (definition): needed to determine the type of dev->bus and how it is used/typed; this influences whether dev (and/or bus) could be passed as const.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (definition): contains the declaration of the dev_dma_unmap function pointer. The parameter types (and any const qualifiers) in this ops structure determine whether metal_dma_unmap can accept const pointers and still call the callback without a cast/qualification mismatch.\n- dev_dma_unmap function-pointer prototype/type as declared in struct metal_bus_ops: the exact signature (parameter types and const qualifiers) of this callback is the primary determinant of whether metal_dma_unmap's 'dev' and 'sg' parameters can be const. If the callback expects non-const pointers, the wrapper cannot make them const without violating compatibility.\n- All concrete implementations (prototypes/definitions) of the dev_dma_unmap callback reachable via dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap: even if the ops prototype allows const, real implementations may modify the pointed-to objects. Inspecting reachable implementations tells you whether the objects are actually modified, therefore whether const qualification is appropriate.\n- struct metal_sg (definition): required to see whether the scatter-gather list contents are modified by callers or the callee; knowing the sg type and its intended mutability is necessary to decide if the 'sg' pointer parameter in metal_dma_unmap can be const.\n\n(Other symbols in the function body such as atomic_thread_fence or METAL_DMA_DEV_R do not affect pointer const-correctness and are not required for this MISRA const-qualification analysis.)"
