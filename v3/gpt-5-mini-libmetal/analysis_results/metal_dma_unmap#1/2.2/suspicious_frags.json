  "explanation": "The remaining code elements are declarations or structurally necessary and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2: the function signature and its parameter list are required for callers to link to this API; the provided struct and macro definitions are declarations used elsewhere and cannot by themselves be dead code; comments are non-executable; and initialization-related constructs in the project (note: initialization is explicitly excluded from being treated as dead code) are not candidates. Also, unreachable code (code that cannot be executed) is not classified as dead code per the rule notes, so any code proven unreachable by control flow analysis would be treated differently and is not reported here. The three fragments listed are the parts of this function that warrant further investigation for potential unnecessary or redundant execution that might constitute dead code."
