  "explanation": "For checking whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions, the analyzer must see the declarations and definitions that could hide non\u2011standard constructs or map to compiler builtins. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_device: needed to inspect the type of dev and any non\u2011standard attributes on the structure (packed, aligned, compiler attributes) or non\u2011standard member types that could be extensions.\n\n- struct metal_bus: dev->bus is used; its definition may contain attributes or non\u2011standard types or calling\u2011convention annotations that would constitute extensions.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (or the concrete type of ops): the ops structure may declare function pointers with non\u2011standard attributes (e.g. calling\u2011convention attributes, inline assembly, GCC attributes) that would be language extensions; you must see the ops type.\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap (function\u2011pointer declaration/prototype): to determine if the call uses any extension (variadic prototype, attribute((\u2026)), non\u2011standard calling conventions, or macros that expand to builtins) you must inspect the exact declaration/signature.\n\n- struct metal_sg: to confirm this is a plain POD type and does not use extensions (bit\u2011fields with implementation specifics, attributes, anonymous structures/unions, etc.).\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R (and other METAL_DMA_* constants): these macros/enums determine control flow; they may be defined using compiler extensions or unusual macros \u2014 need to inspect their definitions to ensure no extension usage.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: this call is central to the function. Although part of C11, many projects map it to compiler builtins (e.g. __atomic_thread_fence or __sync_synchronize) or provide custom macros; you must inspect its actual declaration/definition to see if it is a standard C11 symbol or a compiler extension.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: these identifiers come from the atomics API; their definitions could be enum constants, macros, or mapped to compiler\u2011specific constants \u2014 inspect to ensure standard usage rather than an extension.\n\n- <stdatomic.h> / implementation of atomic_thread_fence (e.g. mapping to compiler builtin such as __atomic_thread_fence): the header/implementation will show whether atomics are implemented via standard C11 facilities or via compiler builtins/extensions. This is required to decide MISRA compliance concerning language extensions.\n\n- uint32_t typedef (from <stdint.h>): although standard, confirming the typedef origin avoids surprises where a project redefines integer types with compiler extensions or attributes.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next agent determine whether any of the used identifiers or constructs are implemented via compiler\u2011specific builtins, attributes, macros, or other language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
