  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be able to prove the target function does not assign to or otherwise modify its parameter objects (the parameter variables themselves: dev, dir, sg, nents). Each listed symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: needed to determine which branch is taken in the memory-barrier conditional; confirm no assignment to parameters occurs in evaluating this constant.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: needed to verify the call does not modify any of the target function's parameter variables (it only takes an enum value and acts on memory barriers). Also to confirm the call is not a macro that could expand to code that assigns to parameters.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: the enumerators passed to atomic_thread_fence; include them to ensure they are ordinary constants/enums and that passing them cannot cause parameter modification via macro side-effects.\n\n- struct metal_device: required to check the type of parameter dev, confirm that dev is a pointer (or not), and to inspect the definition of its member 'bus' so we can reason about expressions like dev->bus and whether any hidden macro or overloaded operator could modify dev.\n\n- struct metal_bus (type of dev->bus): needed to confirm dev->bus is a pointer/member and to inspect its layout; this is necessary because the code dereferences dev->bus to reach ops, and we must ensure no code here reassigns the dev parameter.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (bus->ops): required to inspect the ops structure and in particular the dev_dma_unmap member to see its declared type (function pointer) and ensure access to it is a simple read (no macros or setters that could alter parameters).\n\n- dev_dma_unmap (the function-pointer member signature/prototype): critical to check the prototype of the callback being invoked. We must verify the callback accepts parameters by value (e.g., struct metal_device *dev) rather than by reference-to-pointer (e.g., struct metal_device **). If the callback took a pointer-to-pointer and the code passed a pointer in a way that permitted modification of the original parameter variable, that could implicate the MISRA rule. Also inspect whether the callback is a macro that could assign to the caller's parameters.\n\n- struct metal_sg: include the scatter-gather structure type to confirm sg is a pointer type and to ensure there are no macros/type-aliases that would make passing sg modify the pointer parameter itself.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (1) that no assignments to the parameter variables (dev, dir, sg, nents) occur in this function body, (2) that none of the called functions/macros (atomic_thread_fence or the dev_dma_unmap callback) are implemented as macros or inline expansions that could modify the parameter variables directly, and (3) that the dev_dma_unmap callback's signature does not accept a pointer-to-pointer that could be used to alter the caller's pointer parameter itself."
