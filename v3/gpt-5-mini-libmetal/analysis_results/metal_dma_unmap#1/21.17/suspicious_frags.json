  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 applies specifically to use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The provided function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions or any explicit buffer copying/string operations. It only uses atomic_thread_fence, pointer checks, and a call through a device-specific dev_dma_unmap function pointer. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 compliance."
