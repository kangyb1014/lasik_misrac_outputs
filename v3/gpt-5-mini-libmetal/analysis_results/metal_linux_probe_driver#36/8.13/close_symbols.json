  "explanation": "To decide whether pointers in metal_linux_probe_driver should be const-qualified under MISRA (i.e., whether they could/should point to const-qualified types) we must know the exact types and how they are used beyond this function. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition): The function reads and writes members of ldrv (sdrv, drv_name, mod_name). We need the full declaration to know the types of these members (e.g. whether drv_name/mod_name are already const char * and the precise type of sdrv) so we can judge if any of those pointer members could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): The function passes lbus->bus_name to sysfs_open_driver. Knowing the declared type of bus_name (char * vs const char *) is necessary to determine if the pointer should be const-qualified.\n\n- prototype/definition of sysfs_open_driver: The return type and parameter types (are the string parameters const char *? what pointer type is returned?) are essential. If sysfs_open_driver returns a pointer to a non-const target or accepts mutable pointers, that constrains whether sdrv and the string arguments can be const-qualified.\n\n- definition of the type pointed to by ldrv->sdrv (the sdrv target struct): MISRA const qualification applies to the target type. We must inspect whether code elsewhere modifies the pointed-to object; knowing the target type and its API/usage lets us decide if the pointer could be to const-qualified data.\n\n- metal_linux_bus_close (definition/prototype): This function (listed in the static call graph) likely operates on the bus/driver structures and may read or modify ldrv->sdrv or the object it points to. If it modifies the pointed-to object or assigns to sdrv, that prevents marking sdrv or its target as const.\n\n- metal_linux_register_bus (definition/prototype): Also a callee in the probe path; it may store or later modify driver data or the sdrv pointer. Its usage determines whether sdrv or its target must remain mutable.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_bus (definition/prototype): The caller of metal_linux_probe_driver; context in which the driver struct is allocated/initialized and later used is required to see whether members (drv_name, mod_name, sdrv) are intended to be immutable or are modified elsewhere.\n\nTogether, these symbols give the type information and cross-function usage needed to determine whether pointer targets (bus_name, drv_name, mod_name, sdrv and the sdrv target type) can be safely declared const per the MISRA rule."
