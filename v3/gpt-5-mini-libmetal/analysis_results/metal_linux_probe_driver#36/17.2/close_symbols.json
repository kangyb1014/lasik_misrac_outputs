  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_probe_driver participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect all functions it calls and the functions that call it (and their transitive callees). Explanations:\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: The target calls this; its body could invoke other project functions (possibly creating an indirect cycle back to metal_linux_probe_driver). You need its definition/call graph.\n- struct sysfs_driver (type of ldrv->sdrv): The sdrv object returned/held might include callbacks or methods that could call into bus/driver probe functions; inspect its type and any function-pointer fields.\n- metal_log: Called by the target; although logging is normally benign, its implementation could call other project functions \u2014 include it to rule out recursion.\n- system: Standard library call invoked by the target; include to be explicit that it does not call back into project probe functions.\n- snprintf: Standard library call; include to show it does not create recursion.\n- metal_linux_probe_bus: Listed as a caller of metal_linux_probe_driver in the static call graph; include its definition/call graph to check for cycles (e.g., probe_bus -> probe_driver -> ... -> probe_bus).\n- metal_linux_bus_close: Appears in the probe_bus callee list in the provided static graph; include to inspect transitive calls that might form a cycle.\n- metal_linux_register_bus: Appears in the probe_bus callee list; include for the same reason \u2014 it could participate in an indirect call path.\n- metal_linux_bus_init: Caller of metal_linux_probe_bus per the static graph; include to examine higher-level call paths that could produce indirect recursion.\n- struct linux_bus: Types and fields (e.g., bus_name) could include function pointers or references that lead to callbacks; include its definition to rule out indirect calls via data-structure-held callbacks.\n- struct linux_driver: Definition (fields mod_name, drv_name, sdrv) to check for embedded callbacks or function pointers that could cause indirect recursion.\n\nProviding these symbols and their definitions/call graphs will allow a precise determination whether any direct or indirect call path starting from metal_linux_probe_driver leads back to itself, thus violating the MISRA rule."
