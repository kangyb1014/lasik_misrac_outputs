  "explanation": "- for_each_linux_driver (macro): Expands the loop that visits each linux_driver. The macro body can inline calls or comparisons (or expand other helper macros) that might use memcmp to compare strings; you must inspect its expansion to ensure no memcmp-on-NUL-terminated-string occurs during iteration.\n- sysfs_close_driver: Called for each ldrv->sdrv. Its implementation (and any helpers it calls) may use memcmp to compare null-terminated names/strings; include it to check for inappropriate memcmp usage.\n- sysfs_close_bus: Called on lbus->sbus at the end. Its implementation may perform string comparisons (via memcmp) on sysfs names \u2014 include to inspect for violations.\n- to_linux_bus: The direct callee that converts the generic bus pointer to struct linux_bus. Although likely a simple cast, include its definition to ensure it contains no string comparisons or inline calls to memcmp.\n- struct linux_driver (definition): Needed to know the type of the sdrv member and any string fields in linux_driver that might be compared (directly or in called functions).\n- struct linux_bus (definition): Needed to know the type/contents of sbus and any string fields that could be compared by sysfs or other helpers.\n- type/struct pointed-to by linux_driver->sdrv (e.g. sysfs driver type): The concrete sysfs driver/binding structure and its implementation of close/unregister routines are likely locations for string comparisons; include their definitions and callees to find memcmp usage.\n- type/struct pointed-to by linux_bus->sbus (e.g. sysfs bus type): As above for bus-level sysfs objects \u2014 include to inspect any string comparisons in their close paths.\n- memcmp (standard library): Include references/usages of memcmp so you can detect whether any of the functions/macros above call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (the specific MISRA concern).\n\nInspecting the implementations and callees of the listed symbols will allow determination whether any memcmp calls are used to compare NUL-terminated strings in the close path exercised by metal_linux_bus_close."
