  "explanation": "to_linux_bus: the target directly calls this helper; you must inspect its body to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls back into metal_linux_bus_close or any function that can reach it.\nsysfs_close_driver: called for each driver in the loop; its implementation may invoke driver callbacks or teardown paths that could call into bus/driver code that eventually reaches metal_linux_bus_close.\nsysfs_close_bus: called at the end; its implementation may invoke bus teardown callbacks (or other functions) that could form an indirect call path back to metal_linux_bus_close.\nfor_each_linux_driver (macro/iterator expansion): the loop construct may hide calls or control-flow (e.g. iterator helpers) that invoke functions or callbacks; you must see the macro expansion to ensure no recursive calls are performed during iteration.\nstruct linux_driver (definition and its function\u2011pointer members): the loop accesses ldrv and ldrv->sdrv; driver structures often contain callback pointers (probe/remove/release) whose invocation inside sysfs or iterator code could create an indirect path back to the target \u2014 inspect these members and where they are called.\nstruct linux_bus (definition and its function\u2011pointer members): similarly, linux_bus may contain function pointers or links used by sysfs_close_bus or other helpers; inspect these to detect indirect recursion.\nmetal_linux_probe_bus: this function is a known caller of metal_linux_bus_close (per the static call graph); include it when following potential indirect call chains (if any callee of metal_linux_bus_close can call probe_bus, that would form a recursion cycle)."
