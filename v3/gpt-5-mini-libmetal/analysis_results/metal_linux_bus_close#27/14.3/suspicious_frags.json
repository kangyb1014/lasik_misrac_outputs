  "explanation": "The only controlling expressions in this function are the loop macro and the if condition; both should be inspected to ensure they are not invariant (the macro expansion for the loop in particular may hide the actual controlling expression). All other lines are function calls or assignments (sysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv); ldrv->sdrv = NULL; sysfs_close_bus(lbus->sbus); lbus->sbus = NULL;) and are not controlling expressions, so they do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and need not be investigated for invariant controlling expressions."
