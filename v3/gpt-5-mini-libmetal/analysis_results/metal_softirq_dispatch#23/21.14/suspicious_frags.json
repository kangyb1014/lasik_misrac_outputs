  "explanation": "No usage of memcmp is present in the provided code fragments. The function metal_softirq_dispatch and the related struct show only integer/atomic operations, pointer accesses, and a char used as a flag\u2014there are no char* or char[] string objects being compared, nor any calls to memcmp (or to string-comparison functions that would imply memcmp use). The only external call is metal_irq_handle, whose implementation was not provided; since it is not present in the submitted code, it cannot be flagged here. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
