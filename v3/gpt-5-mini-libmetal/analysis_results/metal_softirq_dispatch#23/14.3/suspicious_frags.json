  "explanation": "The only controlling expressions in the function are the for-loop header and the if statement above; these are reported for investigation under Rule 14.3. All other code fragments are not controlling expressions (variable declarations, the atomic_load/atomic_compare_exchange_strong function calls as operands of the if, the assignment to irq, and the call to metal_irq_handle) and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no other loops, do-while constructs, or unconditional/infinite-loop controlling expressions present in the function to be investigated."
