First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. Rationale: \n- First clause: i = 0 assigns the loop counter; this meets clause 1. \n- Second clause: i < metal_softirq_num uses only the loop counter and a read-only object (metal_softirq_num). It has no persistent side effects and does not reference any object that is modified in the loop body. The loop body modifies elements of metal_softirq_pending and may call functions that change other state, but those objects are not used in the loop condition. \n- Third clause: i++ modifies only the loop counter and does not use objects that are modified in the loop body. \n- Single loop counter: only the single identifier i is used as the loop counter and it is not modified inside the loop body (only by the third clause). \n- Loop control flags: none are used in the second clause. \nTherefore the for statement is well-formed per Rule 14.2 and no code fragments require further investigation under this rule."
