  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 17.2 violation would occur only if metal_softirq_dispatch is invoked (directly or indirectly) by a function called from within this function. The only actual function call here that can lead to such indirect recursion is metal_irq_handle \u2014 it must be investigated to see whether it (or functions it calls) calls metal_softirq_dispatch. The atomic operations (atomic_load, atomic_compare_exchange_strong) are standard atomic intrinsics/operations and are not expected to call back into application-level functions; their presence only affects control flow (whether the handler is invoked) and therefore does not by itself create recursion. Simple statements such as the for-loop header, the local declarations (struct metal_irq *irq;, char is_pending = 1;), the assignment irq = &metal_softirqs[i];, and the index/offset expression (i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base) are not function calls and cannot by themselves produce recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
