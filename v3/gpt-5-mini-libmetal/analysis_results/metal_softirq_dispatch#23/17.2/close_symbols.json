  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_softirq_dispatch violates the MISRA recursion rule you must confirm that no call chain from metal_softirq_dispatch returns to itself. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- metal_irq_handle (definition/body): metal_softirq_dispatch directly calls metal_irq_handle; its implementation must be inspected to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_softirq_dispatch.\n\n- struct metal_irq (definition \u2014 especially the handler/callback function-pointer field): metal_irq_handle commonly invokes a callback stored in the irq structure (e.g., irq->handler). Knowing the struct layout and the exact field name is necessary to identify such indirect calls.\n\n- metal_softirqs (array definition and initializer(s)): metal_softirq_dispatch passes &metal_softirqs[i] to metal_irq_handle. The initialization of this array can bind specific handler function pointers (possibly to metal_softirq_dispatch), so you must check these initializers to detect recursion via handler assignments.\n\n- IRQ handler function-pointer type(s) (e.g., metal_irq handler typedef): the prototype/type is needed to resolve which functions are valid handlers and to match actual function symbols assigned to the handler field.\n\n- All functions called (directly or via function pointers) by metal_irq_handle \u2014 the transitive callee set: even if metal_irq_handle does not directly call metal_softirq_dispatch, one of its callees (or a handler it invokes) might. You must examine the full transitive closure of callees reachable from metal_irq_handle to prove absence of indirect recursion.\n\nInspecting these symbols together lets you determine whether any call path from metal_softirq_dispatch through metal_irq_handle (or functions invoked by it or via handler function pointers) returns to metal_softirq_dispatch, which is what would violate the MISRA rule."
