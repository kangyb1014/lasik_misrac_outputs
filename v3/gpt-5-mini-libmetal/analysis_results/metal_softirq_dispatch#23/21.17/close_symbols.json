  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_softirq_dispatch can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses from use of string.h functions, the analyzer needs the following information:\n\n- metal_softirq_num: the loop bound \u2014 required to check that the iteration range does not exceed array sizes.\n- metal_softirq_enabled: the array being indexed by i (element type and full definition/size) \u2014 needed to verify the i index is valid and to inspect element type used with atomic_load.\n- metal_softirq_pending: the array being atomically compared/modified (element type and full definition/size) \u2014 required to confirm indexing is safe and to understand the atomic compare_exchange_strong operand types/semantics.\n- metal_softirqs: the array of struct metal_irq whose element address is passed to metal_irq_handle \u2014 need its size to ensure &metal_softirqs[i] is in bounds and the struct layout (fields) to see if metal_irq_handle could operate on any internal buffers with string functions.\n- metal_softirq_cntr: the object providing irq_base (its type and value) \u2014 i + irq_base is passed to metal_irq_handle; the value affects indexing/IDs that metal_irq_handle may use to index other tables, possibly leading to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n- metal_irq_handle: the full prototype and implementation \u2014 essential because this callee may call standard string.h functions (memcpy, strlen, etc.). To check MISRA string bounds rules you must inspect metal_irq_handle to see if it uses string functions and whether its pointer/length arguments can be influenced by values computed here (pointer to metal_irq and irq number).\n- struct metal_irq: the type definition \u2014 to know what fields metal_irq_handle may read/write (buffers, pointers, lengths) so you can determine if any string function calls operate on those fields and whether those operations could exceed bounds.\n- declaration/typedef of the atomic element types used (e.g., whether arrays are _Atomic<char>, atomic_int, or custom atomic_t): atomic semantics and element width affect how atomic_compare_exchange_strong is called and whether there is any implicit type/size mismatch relevant to buffer operations.\n- atomic_load and atomic_compare_exchange_strong declarations/semantics: to ensure the usage here (passing &is_pending as the expected value) does not itself cause unintended memory writes outside local storage, and to understand whether these operations can alter other memory in ways that affect string operations elsewhere.\n- any macros/constants that define the lengths/sizes of the above arrays: if array sizes are defined via macros or computed values, those definitions are needed to determine bounds precisely.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows a downstream analyzer to (1) confirm that the loop indices and array accesses inside metal_softirq_dispatch are in-bounds, and (2) inspect metal_irq_handle and related data structures to see whether any string.h functions are called with pointers/lengths derived from these objects and whether such calls could access memory beyond object bounds (the specific MISRA concern)."
