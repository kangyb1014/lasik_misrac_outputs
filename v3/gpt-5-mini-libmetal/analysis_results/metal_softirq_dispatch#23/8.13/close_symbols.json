  "explanation": "1) metal_irq_handle (prototype and definition/body): You must know the function signature (parameter types, especially whether the first parameter is declared as struct metal_irq * or const struct metal_irq *) and inspect the body to see whether it modifies the pointed-at object. If the callee writes into the struct, the pointer must be non-const; if it only reads, it should accept a pointer-to-const. The prototype alone may not be sufficient \u2014 the definition is needed to determine actual modification behavior.\n\n2) struct metal_irq (complete definition): The concrete layout and semantics of the struct are needed to determine whether its members are intended to be modifiable. Some members may be logically immutable (requiring const qualification), or the struct may contain mutable state that justifies a non-const pointer. You also need the definition to determine whether any writes in metal_irq_handle actually modify non-const members.\n\n3) metal_softirqs (declaration including const/volatile qualifiers and type): The array (or storage) that supplies &metal_softirqs[i] must be inspected to see whether its elements are declared const. If the array elements are const, taking a non-const struct metal_irq * or passing them to a non-const-accepting function would violate const-correctness. Knowing the exact declaration (type, qualifiers, linkage) is necessary to decide if the local pointer should be const-qualified or if the call is type-correct under MISRA guidance."
