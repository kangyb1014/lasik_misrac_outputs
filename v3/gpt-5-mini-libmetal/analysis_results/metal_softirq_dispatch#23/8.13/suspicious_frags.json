  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are not pointer declarations or pointer usages that could/should be const-qualified. Examples: the loop control (for (i = 0; ...)), the integer index 'i', and the local scalar 'is_pending' are non-pointer objects. The remaining tokens (array bounds, integer arithmetic like i + metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base, and the function header) do not involve pointers that could be const-qualified, so they are out of scope for Rule 8.13 inspection."
