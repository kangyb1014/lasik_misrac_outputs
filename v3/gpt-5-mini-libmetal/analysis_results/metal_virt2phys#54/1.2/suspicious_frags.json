  "explanation": "All other code in metal_virt2phys uses standard C (and common POSIX) constructs and does not involve compiler language extensions. Specifically:\n- Function declaration/definition, storage class specifier (static), and return type are standard C.\n- Standard integer types and casts (uint64_t, uintptr_t, unsigned long long) are from standard headers (stdint.h, stddef.h) and standard C.\n- Pointer-to-integer cast and bitwise/shift operations are standard C (C99 and later for uintptr_t use).\n- Use of sizeof, local variable declarations, and simple arithmetic are standard.\n- Use of pread(), strerror(), errno, off_t and the error macros (EINVAL, ENOENT) are POSIX/C library facilities, not language extensions.\n- Format specifiers and explicit casts used for printf-style calls are standard practice.\n- Comments and return statements are standard.\n\nTherefore, no other fragments in the provided code need investigation for use of compiler language extensions."
