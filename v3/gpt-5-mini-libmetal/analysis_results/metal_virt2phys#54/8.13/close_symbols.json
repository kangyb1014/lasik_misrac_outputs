  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_virt2phys should take a pointer-to-const (and thus whether it violates MISRA's \u201cpointer should point to const whenever possible\u201d), the analyzer must know how that pointer value is produced and used by callers and whether changing the parameter to const would introduce a const-qualification mismatch or hide a required mutation. Specifically:\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (full function definition / caller site): metal_shmem_try_map is the only caller (per the call graph). Its source is required to see exactly what expression is passed to metal_virt2phys, whether that expression is already a const-qualified pointer, and whether the caller expects metal_virt2phys to modify the pointee (even if the current body does not). This establishes whether making the parameter const is compatible and appropriate.\n\n- metal_map (prototype and/or definition): metal_shmem_try_map calls metal_map to obtain memory mappings in that code path. If the addr passed into metal_virt2phys comes from metal_map (or another producer), the producer's return type (void * vs const void *) and semantics determine whether the pointee is conceptually mutable or const. Knowing metal_map's signature and behavior is necessary to determine whether the addr should be const-qualified and whether callers rely on mutability.\n\n- _metal (global struct/variable definition; at least fields page_shift and pagemap_fd): metal_virt2phys uses _metal.page_shift to compute offsets from addr. Examining the _metal definition and related comments/semantics helps confirm that metal_virt2phys only treats addr as an address integer (no dereference) and that taking a const pointer is semantically safe. It also helps ensure there are no side effects or hidden APIs that require a non-const pointer.\n\n- The argument expression in metal_shmem_try_map that is passed as the addr parameter (its declaration/type and any casts): beyond the function body text, the exact declaration/type of the variable/expression passed (including any casts) is needed to detect implicit/explicit const casts that would be affected by changing metal_virt2phys to accept a const-qualified pointer. This reveals potential const-discarding casts and whether adding const would mask problems or break code semantics.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether metal_virt2phys itself mutates the pointee (it does not), (2) whether callers supply/preserve const qualification, and (3) whether changing the parameter to point-to-const would be safe and consistent with the rest of the codebase in the translation unit."
