  "explanation": "- _metal (definition/declaration): The controlling expression _metal.pagemap_fd < 0 depends on the global _metal.pagemap_fd value and _metal.page_shift is used in shifts. To decide if the expression can be treated as invariant you must know the variable\u2019s declaration, whether its fields are const/volatile, and whether they can be modified at run-time. The struct layout and any qualifiers are essential.\n\n- metal_io_init: This function (and any initializer) may open the pagemap and set _metal.pagemap_fd or _metal.page_shift. If it assigns those fields, the controlling expression _metal.pagemap_fd < 0 is not inherently invariant. You must inspect this symbol to see if/when _metal.pagemap_fd changes.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map and metal_shmem_open: These callers/initializers (present in the static call graph) may also initialize or alter _metal.pagemap_fd or related state. They are needed to determine whether the pagemap_fd test could change across calls or is effectively invariant.\n\n- pread (prototype/semantics): The controlling expression error < 0 tests the return of pread. To determine if that test is invariant you must know pread\u2019s return semantics (how/when it returns negative, whether it can fail or succeed at runtime) and that it is not a constant/macro that yields a compile-time value.\n\n- errno (declaration/semantics): The code uses errno after pread; while errno is not itself used directly in a controlling expression here, understanding errno\u2019s linkage/semantics helps determine whether translating pread failures into control flow is dynamic rather than constant.\n\n- ENOENT and EINVAL (macros): These are used in the returned error codes. Knowing their definitions isn\u2019t strictly about invariance, but they clarify that the function returns platform error codes rather than compile-time constants that would affect control decisions.\n\nRationale: MISRA Rule 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' requires determining whether each if-condition can change at runtime or is a compile-/link-time constant. The above symbols provide the necessary declarations and potential mutation sites (initializers and I/O call behavior) to decide if _metal.pagemap_fd < 0, error < 0, or ((entry >> 62) != 2) can be invariant."
