  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (conditions of if/for/while/do-while). The three if-statements above are the only controlling expressions in this function and therefore are the only fragments that need investigation for possible invariance. All other lines are assignments, computations, function calls, or return statements (e.g. computing offset, calling pread, assigning *phys, shifts and masks) and are not controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3, so they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
