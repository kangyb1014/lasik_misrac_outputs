  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the provided function or the related macro. The function performs binary operations on a uint64_t entry read from /proc/self/pagemap and does not perform any string comparisons; the only string-related use is strerror(errno) passed to the logging macro (used for output with %s), not compared. The metal_log macro shown only formats/logs messages and does not call memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that match MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) and no fragments need further investigation for this rule."
