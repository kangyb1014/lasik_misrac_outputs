  "explanation": "For MISRA C unreachable-code analysis we must know which branches/returns are actually feasible and whether any operations invoke undefined behaviour that could allow the compiler to remove code. Each symbol listed is required for that reasoning:\n\n- _metal: full definition (type) is needed to see field types/initialization, possible invariants and whether accesses are well-formed.\n- _metal.pagemap_fd: its type and initialization/range determine whether the first if (_metal.pagemap_fd < 0) branch can be true or false (reachability of that return).\n- _metal.page_shift: its type and allowed range are required to determine whether shifts (addr >> page_shift) and the final left shift (<< _metal.page_shift) are defined or could be UB; an out-of-range page_shift could make code behavior undefined and thus affect reachability.\n- pread: prototype and runtime semantics (return values on success/EOF/error, whether it can return 0 or partial reads) determine reachability of the error branch (error < 0) and whether entry is reliably initialized for subsequent checks.\n- errno: used in error handling and passed to strerror/returned; knowledge of errno semantics is needed to reason about the logging/return path (not strictly reachability but relevant to error-return branches being reachable).\n- strerror: signature and side-effects (reads errno) are needed to confirm the logging call is a normal reachable call and does not e.g. longjmp or abort, which would change reachability.\n- metal_log: signature and side-effects (does it return normally or could it terminate/longjmp) are required to know whether code after a logging call is reachable.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: macro/constant could expand to code that affects control-flow (e.g. may contain expressions or compile-time guards); need its definition to ensure logging invocations are ordinary calls.\n- off_t: type width and signedness affect computation of offset and whether offset can be negative/overflow, which impacts whether the pread call and subsequent branches are reachable.\n- uint64_t: width and semantics of entry define behaviour of right/left shifts and masks; necessary to determine if shift/mask operations are valid and whether the check (entry >> 62) != 2 can be meaningfully evaluated.\n- uintptr_t: width and semantics for casting addr and shifting matter for the offset computation and UB considerations (shifting beyond width).\n- sizeof(uint64_t): the code uses sizeof(entry); knowing it equals 8 (or not) matters when reasoning whether pread reads the expected number of bytes and whether partial/zero reads are possible.\n- EINVAL, ENOENT: existence and meanings are needed to confirm the return-value branches are ordinary returns (not macros that alter flow) and to label the error-return branches as reachable.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions, prototypes and any invariants/initialization constraints) lets an analyst determine whether each conditional and call in metal_virt2phys can actually be reached, and whether any UB could cause the compiler to treat code as unreachable (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
