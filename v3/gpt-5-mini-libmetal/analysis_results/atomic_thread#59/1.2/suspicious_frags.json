  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific notes: \n- atomic_int and atomic_fetch_add are part of the C11 <stdatomic.h> standard (they rely on _Atomic), not a compiler-specific extension. If the project targets C11 or later these are standard. \n- The function signature (static void *atomic_thread(void *arg)) and returning NULL follow the conventional pthreads thread function pattern; pthreads is a library API, not a language extension. \n- The assignment atomic_int *c = arg; uses the implicit conversion from void* to object pointer types, which is allowed in C (it would be a problem in C++ but not a language-extension issue in C). \n- The use of static storage (static const int atomic_test_count = 1000) and the for-loop are standard C constructs. \n- There are no compiler-specific tokens (e.g., __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, or vendor-specific keywords) present in the code. \nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigating for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions). If the build uses a nonstandard compiler that documents nonconforming behavior for any of these identifiers, that would be outside this code excerpt and should be checked against that compiler\u2019s documentation."
