  "explanation": "To decide if atomic_thread uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions/expansions of the atomic symbols and related macros/headers used by the function:\n\n- atomic_int: Determine how this type is defined (C11 _Atomic, typedef to an implementation-defined type, or a compiler-specific extension). If it is defined using a compiler extension, that would violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- atomic_fetch_add: This identifier may be a function, inline function, or macro. You need its definition to see if it expands to or calls compiler builtins or other non\u2011standard constructs (e.g. __atomic_* or __sync_*), or if it is the standard stdatomic.h implementation.\n\n- atomic_test_count: The global used by the loop. Its declaration (type and definition) must be inspected to see whether it is declared with a standard atomic type or implemented with an extension.\n\n- stdatomic.h: The header that normally provides atomic_int and atomic_fetch_add. Inspecting the header (or the translation-unit view of it) shows whether the implementation is the standard C11 facility or is replaced/implemented using compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- NULL: Its definition can vary between implementations. While usually standard, an uncommon non\u2011standard definition could be a language extension; include its macro definition to be sure no extension is used.\n\n- __atomic_fetch_add and __sync_fetch_and_add: These are common compiler builtin primitives used by implementations to implement atomic_fetch_add. They are documented compiler extensions. If atomic_fetch_add expands to either of these, the code relies on compiler-specific extensions and should be reported.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions allows the next analyser to determine whether the code uses only standard language features (C11 stdatomic or plain C) or whether any compiler\u2011documented extensions are used."
