  "scenario": "No violation in this code: the pointer c points to an atomic_int that is modified via atomic_fetch_add(c, 1), so it must not be const-qualified. A violation would occur if c were only read (e.g. only passed to atomic_load or used to read values) \u2014 in that case the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const atomic_int *c or const atomic_int *c = (const atomic_int *)arg)."
