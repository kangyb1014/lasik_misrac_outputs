  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that involve pointer types or pointer use, which are relevant to checking whether the pointed-to type could/should be const-qualified. Other parts of the function do not involve pointers to object types and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the local integer declaration and loop control (int i; for (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)) are non-pointer operations; atomic_test_count is already const-qualified; the return NULL; and the static storage-class specifiers are unrelated to the rule. The pthread-style function signature constraints (thread entry/return types) also restrict changing the function prototype in typical thread APIs, so non-pointer code and these API-mandated shapes were not included."
