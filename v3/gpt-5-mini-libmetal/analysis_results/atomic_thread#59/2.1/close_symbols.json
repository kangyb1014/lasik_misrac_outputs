  "explanation": "atomic_test_count \u2014 must know its definition, type, initial value and qualifiers (const/volatile) to determine whether the for-loop condition can ever be true (compile-time constant zero, negative, or otherwise) or whether the loop could be optimized away; also to know if it can be modified elsewhere making the loop reachable. atomic_fetch_add \u2014 need the declaration/definition (or macro expansion) and any attributes (e.g. noreturn) to determine whether the call alters control flow or is removed/empty; a noreturn or a macro that expands unexpectedly could make subsequent code (including return) unreachable. atomic_int \u2014 need the typedef/definition to understand the pointer cast semantics and whether atomic_fetch_add might be a macro/function that depends on the actual type; also to detect any unusual macros/types that could change control flow when used. NULL \u2014 need the macro definition to be certain the return statement is a normal return of a null pointer (some projects redefine NULL in uncommon ways), which affects reachability analysis of the return statement."
