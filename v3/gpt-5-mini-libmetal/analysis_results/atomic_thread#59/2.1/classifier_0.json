  "scenario": "No violation: as defined (static const int atomic_test_count = 1000) the loop in atomic_thread will execute and there is no unreachable code. Specific violation scenario: if the constant were defined such that the loop body can never execute (for example, static const int atomic_test_count = 0 or a negative value), then the atomic_fetch_add call inside the for loop would be unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
