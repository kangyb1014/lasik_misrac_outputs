  "explanation": "atomic_test_count: The for-loop controlling expression is i < atomic_test_count. To decide if that expression is invariant you must know the declaration of atomic_test_count (type, storage class, const qualifier, volatile/atomic qualifier, initializer/linkage and whether it can be modified by other translation units or threads). If it is a compile-time constant or a non-volatile non-atomic object that cannot change, the loop control is invariant and may violate MISRA; if it is atomic/volatile or can be updated concurrently it may vary. atomic_int: The code uses atomic_int elsewhere (atomic_int *c). Knowing the typedef/definition of atomic_int and the target project's atomic implementation (C11 _Atomic or typedef) is needed to reason about whether reads of atomic_test_count or other objects are atomic and whether concurrent updates are well-defined (which affects whether the controlling expression can legally change). atomic_fetch_add: Although it operates on *c, you must inspect its prototype/semantics to ensure it cannot (directly or indirectly) modify atomic_test_count or have side effects that influence the controlling expression. Also its memory-order semantics may be relevant when reasoning about concurrency and whether updates to atomic_test_count by other threads will be observed."
