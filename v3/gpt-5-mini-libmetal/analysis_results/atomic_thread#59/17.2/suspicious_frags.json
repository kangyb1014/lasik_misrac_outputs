  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found related to Rule 17.2 (functions shall not call themselves). Analysis details:\n- The only function present is atomic_thread. Its body performs a simple for-loop and calls atomic_fetch_add(c, 1). There is no direct call to atomic_thread within its own body.\n- The function parameter arg is used as an atomic_int pointer; it is not a function pointer and therefore cannot be used to indirectly call atomic_thread.\n- atomic_test_count is a static const int and cannot introduce recursion.\n- The only external call is to atomic_fetch_add. In standard C this is an atomic library function (or builtin) and does not invoke user thread-entry functions; unless a user-defined atomic_fetch_add in this codebase recursively calls atomic_thread (not shown), there is no indirect recursion. To fully eliminate the (very unlikely) possibility of indirect recursion, the definition/implementation of atomic_fetch_add in this project would need to be inspected; absent that, no suspicious recursion is present in the provided code fragments."
