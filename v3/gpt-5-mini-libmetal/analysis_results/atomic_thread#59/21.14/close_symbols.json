  "explanation": "- atomic_fetch_add: This is the only function called by atomic_thread. To determine whether the target function (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp on null-terminated strings you must inspect the implementation or expansion of atomic_fetch_add (it could be a macro or wrapper that itself calls other functions).\n- atomic_int: The type of the argument pointed to by arg. Its definition could be a typedef or a struct that pulls in other functions or wrappers; you must confirm it is a plain integer type and does not hide string comparisons via conversion functions.\n- atomic_test_count: The loop bound is a symbol that may be a macro, function-like expression, or global whose definition could include calls to other functions (including memcmp). Inspecting its definition rules out indirect uses of memcmp that would make the MISRA rule applicable.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets use of the standard memcmp function to compare null-terminated strings. The analysis must check for any calls to memcmp in the target function and in any functions it calls (directly or transitively).\n- (any transitive callees of atomic_fetch_add): If atomic_fetch_add expands to or calls other functions, those must be included so the analyzer can search their bodies for uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nOnly these symbols are required to decide whether atomic_thread (or its callees/related definitions) violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
