  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve pointers whose pointee type could plausibly be const-qualified and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 8.13: bus_name and dev_name are already const-qualified (const char *), strlen usage is consistent with const; the local scalar 'int error;' and the return statements do not relate to pointer constness. The selected fragments cover: the function parameter that exposes a non-const pointer-to-pointer (device), the local pointer variable 'bus', the call that obtains/initialises 'bus' (metal_bus_find with &bus), the check and invocation of the bus operation function pointer (which passes bus, dev_name and device). These spots should be reviewed to determine whether the pointee types could/should be const-qualified or whether const is intentionally omitted by the API."
