  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'bus' is passed to metal_bus_find(&bus) which initializes it and later passed to bus->ops.dev_open(bus, ...). Both APIs expect a mutable struct metal_bus* (they modify or use non-const access), so making the pointer point to a const-qualified type would be incompatible with these calls. Therefore this declaration does not violate Rule 8.13. If the code only read from the object and all called APIs accepted const pointers, then the lack of const would be a violation; that is not the case here."
