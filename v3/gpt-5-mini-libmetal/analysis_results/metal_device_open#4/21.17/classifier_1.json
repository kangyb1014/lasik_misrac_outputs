  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Although the code guards against NULL via short-circuiting (so strlen() is not called when the pointer is NULL), it still calls strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name) when the pointers are non-NULL. If either pointer refers to a buffer that is not properly null-terminated or whose valid size is smaller than the stored characters, strlen will read beyond the object bounds. Thus the use of strlen here can result in out-of-bounds accesses and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A concrete violating scenario: caller passes a non-NULL pointer to a char buffer that lacks a terminating '\\0' (or the buffer is shorter than the bytes before the next '\\0'), causing strlen to scan past the buffer and read out-of-bounds memory."
