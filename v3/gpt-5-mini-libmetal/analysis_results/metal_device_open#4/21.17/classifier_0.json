  "scenario": "Calling strlen(dev_name) can read past the object bounds if dev_name points to a non\u2011terminated character array. Although the conditional contains a prior !dev_name test (so a NULL pointer will not be passed to strlen thanks to left\u2011to\u2011right short\u2011circuit evaluation), there is no guarantee that dev_name refers to a null\u2011terminated array. Example violating scenario: caller passes a pointer to a buffer of length N that contains no '\\0' within those N bytes; strlen(dev_name) will scan beyond the buffer until it finds a '\\0', resulting in out\u2011of\u2011bounds access."
