  "explanation": "- metal_bus_find: metal_device_open directly calls this function. To determine whether metal_device_open can (indirectly) call itself, you must inspect metal_bus_find to ensure it does not call metal_device_open or call other functions that eventually do.\\n- struct metal_bus (definition): metal_device_open uses the returned struct metal_bus * (bus). You need the struct definition to understand what members are accessed (bus->ops) and the types involved, and to trace where those members come from.\\n- type/definition of bus->ops (e.g. struct metal_bus_ops) and its dev_open member: bus->ops.dev_open is a function pointer call. Static call graph missed function-pointer targets; you must know the ops struct and the exact signature/type of dev_open to identify all possible implementations and verify whether any of them call back to metal_device_open (creating indirect recursion).\\n- metal_bus_register and metal_linux_bus_finish: these appear in the static call graph as callers of metal_bus_find and are likely places where buses are registered and their ops are filled in. Inspecting them can reveal which implementations are assigned to bus->ops.dev_open (the dynamic callees).\\n- All functions that can be assigned to bus->ops.dev_open (dev_open implementations and registration sites): because dev_open is invoked indirectly via a function pointer, every concrete implementation that can be stored in dev_open must be inspected to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) metal_device_open. Also inspect any registration code that binds implementations to dev_open to find the full set of dynamic callees.\\nTogether, these symbols let you follow all direct and indirect call chains originating from metal_device_open, including dynamic (function-pointer) calls, to determine whether the function can (directly or indirectly) call itself and thus violate the MISRA rule."
