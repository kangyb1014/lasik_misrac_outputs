  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. bus_name and dev_name are declared const and only read (strlen checks after null checks); device is tested for null and then passed to the bus-specific dev_open call but is not assigned to or otherwise modified in metal_device_open itself. The address-of operator is used only with the local variable 'bus' when calling metal_bus_find (&bus), so no parameter is altered. The calls to strlen and to the bus operation are read-only with respect to this function\u2019s parameters (strlen is called only after checking for null thanks to left-to-right short-circuit evaluation). Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation in this function."
