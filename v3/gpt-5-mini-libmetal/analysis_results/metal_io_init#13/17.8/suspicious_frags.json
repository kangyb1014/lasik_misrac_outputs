  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is modified in this function. Each assignment updates members of the object pointed to by the pointer parameter 'io' (e.g. io->virt = virt;, io->physmap = physmap;, io->size = size;, io->page_shift = page_shift;, io->page_mask = ..., io->mem_flags = mem_flags;, io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8; what is forbidden is modifying the pointer parameter itself (for example reassigning 'io = ...', 'virt = ...', 'physmap = ...', or 'ops = ...'), and no such reassignments occur. The evaluation of page_shift and the computation of page_mask use the parameter values but do not assign to the parameters. The call metal_sys_io_mem_map(io) passes the pointer but does not modify the parameter variable within this function. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
