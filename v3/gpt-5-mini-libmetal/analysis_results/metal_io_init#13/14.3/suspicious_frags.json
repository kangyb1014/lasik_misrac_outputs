  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. There are no loops in this function (no for/while/do-while) that could contain an invariant controlling expression. The only conditional constructs are:\n- if (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT): sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT is compile-time constant but the overall expression depends on the parameter page_shift, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops; (conditional operator): the controlling expression is the parameter ops, which is runtime-varying, so it is not invariant.\nThere are no do-while constructs with an essentially Boolean constant expression, nor any explicit infinite-loop constructs (e.g. while(1) or for(;;)). Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
