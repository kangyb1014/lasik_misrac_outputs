  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I flagged all executable statements and the local default-ops initializer because dead code (per MISRA Rule 2.2) is defined as executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; these are the points most likely to be unnecessary, redundant, overwritten later, or to have no observable effect on the program. The remaining parts of the snippet (function signature, parameter list, opening/closing braces and comments) are syntactic/function scaffolding and cannot be dead code by the rule (they are not executable operations). No obviously unreachable code (e.g. code after a return, infinite-loop exit unreachable blocks) is present in this function body. Initialization of the local variable declaration itself was included because its use in the ops assignment depends on runtime conditions; other non-listed items are either non-executable structure (braces, prototype) or are simple comments and therefore not candidates for dead code investigation."
