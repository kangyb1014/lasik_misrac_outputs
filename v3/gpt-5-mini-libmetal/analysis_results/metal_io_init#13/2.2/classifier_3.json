  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_init:\n```c\nvoid metal_io_init(struct metal_io_region *io, void *virt,\n\t      const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap, size_t size,\n\t      unsigned int page_shift, unsigned int mem_flags,\n\t      const struct metal_io_ops *ops)\n{\n\tconst struct metal_io_ops nops = {\n\t\tNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL\n\t};\n\n\tio->virt = virt;\n\tio->physmap = physmap;\n\tio->size = size;\n\tio->page_shift = page_shift;\n\tif (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n\t\t/* avoid overflow */\n\t\tio->page_mask = -1UL;\n\telse\n\t\tio->page_mask = (1UL << page_shift) - 1UL;\n\tio->mem_flags = mem_flags;\n\tio->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\n\tmetal_sys_io_mem_map(io);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nio->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The ternary assignment initializes io->ops (either copying *ops or the local nops fallback). Removing it would change program behaviour because subsequent calls (for example metal_sys_io_mem_map and other users of io->ops) rely on io->ops being initialized. The fallback (nops) is required when ops == NULL. Even if in a particular build callers always pass non-NULL, that would make the alternate path unreachable (note 2) but not dead in the sense of Rule 2.2."
