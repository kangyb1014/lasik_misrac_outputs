  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in shmem_child are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (error): \"error\" is assigned by metal_shmem_open(name, size, &io) and is therefore dynamic at runtime.\n- if (phys != METAL_BAD_OFFSET): \"phys\" is assigned by metal_io_phys(io, 0) and thus not constant; comparing it to a constant does not make the controlling expression invariant.\n- if (virt != metal_io_phys_to_virt(io, phys)): both \"virt\" and the result of metal_io_phys_to_virt(io, phys) depend on runtime values (io, phys).\n- if (phys != metal_io_virt_to_phys(io, virt)): similarly depends on runtime results.\n\nThere are no loop controlling expressions (while, for, do-while) with constant conditions; the allowed exceptions for infinite loops or a do-while with a fixed false constant are therefore not applicable. Consequently, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
