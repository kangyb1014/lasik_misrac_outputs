  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are called directly in this snippet, so there are no explicit string-handling usages to inspect here. The only fragments that could affect or be affected by string-handling operations are the places where the tids array is created and where its pointer is passed into other functions: these calls/arguments should be investigated because those external functions (metal_run_noblock, metal_finish_threads) might internally call string.h routines and could potentially access beyond the bounds of the tids object. Other lines (local variable declarations, the return statement, and the cast to void* itself within the shown call) do not, by themselves, invoke any string.h functions and therefore do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this snippet."
