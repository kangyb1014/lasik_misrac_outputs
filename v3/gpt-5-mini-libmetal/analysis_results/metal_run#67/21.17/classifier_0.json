  "scenario": "The call itself does not use any <string.h> functions, so there is no direct evidence of a Rule 21.17 violation in this fragment. A violation could occur inside metal_run_noblock if that function calls functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy/memmove/strcpy/strncpy) with a byte/count parameter larger than the size of the tids array or other target objects. For example, if metal_run_noblock does memcpy(tids, src, n * sizeof *tids) where n > threads, or copies a string into a buffer without checking its length, that would violate Rule 21.17. Based on this single call site, is_rule_violated = false."
