  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_run:\n```c\nint metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg)\n{\n\tpthread_t tids[threads];\n\tint error, ts_created;\n\n\terror = metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created);\n\n\tmetal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids);\n\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\npthread_t tids[threads];\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The variable-length array 'pthread_t tids[threads];' is used: its address is passed to metal_run_noblock(...) and metal_finish_threads(...). Removing this declaration would change program behaviour (the functions would no longer receive a valid buffer), so it is not dead code."
