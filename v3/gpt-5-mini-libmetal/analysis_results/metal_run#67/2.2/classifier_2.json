  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_run:\n```c\nint metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg)\n{\n\tpthread_t tids[threads];\n\tint error, ts_created;\n\n\terror = metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created);\n\n\tmetal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids);\n\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn error;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement 'return error;' is executed and essential. Removing it would change program behavior (the non-void function would fall off the end without returning a value, causing undefined behaviour and altering what callers receive), so it is not dead code."
