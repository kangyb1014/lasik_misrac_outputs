  "scenario": "The code declares a variable-length array: 'pthread_t tids[threads];'. This is a standard C feature (VLA, introduced in C99) rather than a compiler-specific language extension, so under Rule 1.2 as stated no language extension is used. Note: if your toolchain or project forbids C99 VLAs or your specific compiler documents VLAs as a nonstandard extension, then this would be a violation in that environment."
