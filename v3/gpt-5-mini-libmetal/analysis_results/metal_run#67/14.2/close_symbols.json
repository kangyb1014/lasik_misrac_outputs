  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- metal_run_noblock (full definition)\n  - metal_run itself contains no for loops, but it calls metal_run_noblock. Any for loop inside metal_run_noblock (or calls it makes inside a loop) must be checked for the three clauses' correctness. The body of any for loop in metal_run_noblock may call other functions or modify objects used in the loop header; you must see the actual implementation to determine MISRA compliance.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (full definition)\n  - metal_run calls metal_finish_threads directly. If that function contains for loops (or if it calls other functions from within loops), those loops must be inspected for well-formedness and for whether called functions or global objects modify the loop counter or loop control flags.\n\n- metal_thread_t (typedef / prototype of the child thread entry function)\n  - metal_run takes a metal_thread_t child parameter (likely a function pointer). If metal_run_noblock or metal_finish_threads execute the child inside a loop, the child's prototype and semantics are required to decide whether the child can have side effects that violate the rule (e.g., modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop header).\n\n- All concrete 'child' functions passed into metal_run by its callers (definitions from atomic, mutex, shmem, condition, spinlock)\n  - The static call graph shows modules (atomic, mutex, shmem, condition, spinlock) call metal_run. Those callers may pass their own thread-entry functions as the child argument. Any child function invoked from inside a for loop (directly or indirectly) must be inspected because the behaviour of the loop body includes called functions; they may modify loop counters or objects used in the loop header.\n\n- pthread_t definition (platform pthread.h)\n  - metal_run allocates pthread_t tids[threads]. Knowing the pthread_t type helps identify whether objects of that type are used as loop counters or modified in called functions. It is also needed to follow any casts (metal_finish_threads receives (void *)tids) to find uses of tid elements inside called functions that may interact with loops.\n\n- All functions and global objects referenced/called from inside metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads (full definitions)\n  - If those functions call additional functions or read/modify global objects used in loop headers or used as loop control flags, those callees and globals must be examined. MISRA\u2019s rule requires that the second clause uses only the loop counter and optionally a single boolean flag and that no object modified in the loop body is used in the loop-condition; thus you must have the complete set of callees and globals to determine compliance.\n\nIn short: to decide whether metal_run violates the MISRA for-loop rule you need the full implementations of metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads, the child function type and the actual child functions passed at callers, pthread_t definition, and any further callees or global objects used within those functions' for loops. Without those symbols you cannot determine whether loop headers use objects modified in their bodies (including via function calls)."
