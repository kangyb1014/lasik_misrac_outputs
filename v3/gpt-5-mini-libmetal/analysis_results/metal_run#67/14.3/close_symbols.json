  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function (metal_run) or code it invokes violates MISRA C 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' you must inspect any controlling expressions (if/for/while/do) in code that actually executes as part of metal_run. metal_run itself contains no conditional or loop controlling expressions, but it calls two functions that may do so. Therefore you need:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (prototype + full implementation): metal_run directly calls this function and its result (ts_created) and side effects determine subsequent control flow. You must examine all its controlling expressions (loops/ifs/do-while) to see if any are invariant. The prototype is needed to know parameter types and any pointer/array relationships that affect control expressions.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (prototype + full implementation): called immediately after metal_run_noblock, it likely iterates over created threads (ts_created) or inspects tids. Any loops or conditionals inside must be checked for invariant controlling expressions.\n\n- metal_thread_t (typedef/definition): the child parameter type may be dereferenced or used in controlling expressions inside the callees; its definition can be required to understand expressions involving it.\n\n- pthread_t (typedef / <pthread.h>): tids is an array of pthread_t objects; how the callees index or interpret tids (and any pointer casts) can affect loop bounds or controlling expressions. The typedef and related headers may define macros or inline semantics used by the callees.\n\n- All macros, constants and global variables referenced by metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: these symbols may participate in controlling expressions inside those functions (e.g., compile-time constants, global flags, or macros that expand to constant expressions). To correctly judge whether a controlling expression is invariant you must see the actual identifiers and expansions used in those expressions.\n\nIn short: obtain the full implementations (and any types/macros/globals they use) of the two callees so their controlling expressions can be inspected for invariance. The local code in metal_run has no control statements to violate the rule by itself."
