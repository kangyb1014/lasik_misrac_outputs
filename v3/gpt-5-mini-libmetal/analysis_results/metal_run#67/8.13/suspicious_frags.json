  "explanation": "All other lines in the function either do not involve pointer types or are simple non-pointer operations and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically: the declarations \"int error, ts_created;\" and the final \"return error;\" do not introduce pointer objects or pointer parameters. The suspicious fragments listed above cover every place in this function where pointer types are introduced or pointer values are passed to other functions (the function parameter void *arg, the array which decays to a pointer, the address-of operator &ts_created, and the explicit cast to (void *)). Those are the locations that need investigation to determine whether the pointee types could/should be const-qualified; no other fragments in this function are relevant to that rule."
