  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call casts the array 'tids' to a plain void* (metal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids)); if metal_finish_threads only reads the thread identifiers (i.e. its parameter should be const void * or const pthread_t *), then the pointer is not const-qualified here and Rule 8.13 is violated. The explicit (void*) cast is unnecessary and causes/expresses a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified metal_run code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/673.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_run as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_run:\n```c\nint metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg)\n{\n\tpthread_t tids[threads];\n\tint error, ts_created;\n\n\terror = metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created);\n\n\tmetal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids);\n\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified metal_run code.\n",
