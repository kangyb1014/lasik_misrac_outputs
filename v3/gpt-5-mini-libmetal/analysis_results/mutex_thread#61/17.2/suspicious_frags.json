  "explanation": "The only fragments that could participate in indirect recursion are calls to other functions; those three calls should be investigated to ensure those functions do not (directly or indirectly) call mutex_thread. Other code in the snippet does not perform any function calls or function-pointer invocations that could cause recursion: the function definition/signature itself is not a call, the local assignment \"metal_mutex_t *l = arg;\" is not a call, the loop header \"for (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++)\" contains no function calls, and \"return NULL;\" is not a call. There are no occurrences of \"mutex_thread(...)\" or function-pointer dereferences in this fragment, so no other parts need investigation for Rule 17.2."
