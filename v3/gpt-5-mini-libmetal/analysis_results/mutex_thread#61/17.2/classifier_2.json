  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The code calls metal_mutex_release(l) from mutex_thread; this is a call to a different function, not a self-call. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if metal_mutex_release (or a chain of functions it calls) called mutex_thread (directly or indirectly), creating recursion. There is no evidence of such an indirect call in the provided code, so the rule is not violated."
