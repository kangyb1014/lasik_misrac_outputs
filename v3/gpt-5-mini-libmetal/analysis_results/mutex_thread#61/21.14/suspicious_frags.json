  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other memory-comparison call are present in the provided code fragments. The mutex_thread function only calls metal_mutex_acquire, usleep and metal_mutex_release and performs integer loop control; there are no char arrays, char pointers, string literals, or any comparisons of null-terminated strings in the shown code. The additional definitions (mutex_test_count and metal_mutex_t) contain only an integer constant and an atomic_int field, respectively \u2014 neither uses memcmp or string operations. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. (If implementations of the called functions such as metal_mutex_acquire/release or other omitted files use memcmp on null-terminated strings, those definitions would need to be provided and investigated, but they are not part of the given code.)"
