  "explanation": "- mutex_test_count: The for-loop controlling expression is i < mutex_test_count. You must inspect the declaration (type, storage duration, const/volatile qualifiers, initialization) and all write sites to determine whether its value is invariant during the loop. If it is a compile-time constant or never modified while the loop runs the expression is invariant; if it can be changed (by other threads/ISRs/functions) it is not.\\n\\n- metal_mutex_acquire: The target function calls this routine inside the loop. You need its implementation (or at least whether it writes to mutex_test_count or has side-effects that update shared state affecting that variable, or uses memory barriers/volatile access) to determine whether the loop-controlling expression can change as a result of the call.\\n\\n- metal_mutex_release: Same reason as metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 examine its implementation/side-effects to see if it can modify mutex_test_count or otherwise affect whether the controlling expression is invariant.\\n\\n- producer_thread and consumer_thread: These threads are part of the same test harness (they appear in the static call graph alongside mutex_thread). They are potential concurrent writers to mutex_test_count; you must inspect their code to find any assignments or updates to mutex_test_count (or calls that do so).\\n\\nNote: if there are other translation units, ISRs, or helper functions that write to mutex_test_count (or alias it), those symbols must also be provided. The above list is the minimal set to determine whether the loop condition is truly invariant in the running program."
