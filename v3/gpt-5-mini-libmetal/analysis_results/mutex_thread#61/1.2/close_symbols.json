  "explanation": "For checking whether mutex_thread uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the types and declarations it relies on (not just this function body). Include the following symbols and why:\n\n- metal_mutex_t: the actual typedef/struct definition may use compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __packed__, inline assembly, compiler-specific integer types, typeof, anonymous structs/unions). Inspecting the type ensures no extension is hidden in the type declaration.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: the prototype and/or definition must be checked for compiler extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang __attribute__ annotations, inline/extern linkage attributes, nonstandard calling conventions, builtin intrinsics, asm labels). Also check if it is a macro that expands to an extension.\n\n- metal_mutex_release: same reason as metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 the prototype/definition or macro could use language extensions that would make the callsite indirectly use an extension.\n\n- mutex_test_count: the declaration/definition of this global (type, storage-class, initializer) could use extension features (compound literals, typeof in initializer, nonstandard attributes). The for-loop uses this symbol; its type/definition must be checked.\n\n- usleep: this is a POSIX library call (and may be declared in unistd.h) rather than ISO C. Its prototype or header could use nonstandard extensions or macros. Confirming its declaration is from a standard header and does not introduce compiler-specific attributes is required.\n\n- NULL: the macro definition may be implementation-defined (0, ((void*)0), or compiler-specific). Some NULL definitions can be nonstandard in certain contexts; verify its standard macro form (and that return NULL does not rely on an extension).\n\nCollecting the prototypes/definitions (headers or source) for these symbols lets the next analyzer determine whether any of them introduce compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
