  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: The target function calls this routine directly. To determine whether the overall behavior violates the string.h rule we must inspect its implementation (and any functions it calls) to see if it uses any string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.) or otherwise performs pointer/size operations that could access out-of-bounds memory.\n- metal_mutex_release: Same reason as metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 it is called by the target function and must be inspected for uses of string.h functions or unsafe memory accesses.\n- mutex_test_count: The loop bound is read from this global. Its value (type and range) affects the number of iterations and therefore how many times callees run; extremely large or malformed values could expose repeated unsafe behavior in callees. Knowing its definition/type and range is needed to reason about potential out-of-bounds effects occurring across iterations.\n- metal_mutex_t: The target function takes a metal_mutex_t * argument. The definition of this type (layout, any embedded buffers, and how the acquire/release functions interpret the pointer) is needed to check whether any string operations inside callees operate on fields within that object and could access beyond their bounds.\n- usleep: Although a standard sleep function and not from <string.h>, its implementation or wrappers in this environment could call library code that uses string.h functions. To be conservative, inspect usleep (or its platform wrapper) to ensure it does not introduce string.h usage that could produce out-of-bounds accesses reachable from mutex_thread."
