  "explanation": "- metal_mutex_acquire: need the function prototype/definition and any attributes (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn)), longjmp/exit behavior or unconditional infinite loop). If this function cannot return under any condition, the statements following the call (and the loop exit) could be unreachable.\n- metal_mutex_release: same rationale as for metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 its prototype/definition (and attributes/behaviour) could make subsequent code unreachable.\n- mutex_test_count: the loop bound; its definition (macro, const, or variable) and value or range determine whether the for-loop body can ever execute or is provably never executed. If it is a compile-time constant that makes the loop condition always false (or always true leading to infinite loop), that affects reachability of the loop body and the final return.\n- usleep: the prototype/definition (and any special attributes or macros) to confirm it behaves as a normal returning call. If it were annotated as noreturn or replaced by a macro that does not return, that would affect reachability.\n- metal_mutex_t: the type definition to ensure there are no unusual attributes or macros associated with the type name that could affect compilation (e.g. typedef to a function or attribute-bearing type).\n\nThese symbols are required to decide whether any statements in mutex_thread are provably unreachable (per MISRA rule), e.g. due to called functions that never return or compile-time constant loop bounds."
