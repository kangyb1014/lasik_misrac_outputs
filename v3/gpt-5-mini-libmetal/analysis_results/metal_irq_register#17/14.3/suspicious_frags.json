  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (conditions of if/while/for/do-while/switch). The three if conditions in the function are the only controlling expressions present and therefore are the only fragments that warrant investigation for invariance. Other lines in the function are declarations, returns, assignments, pointer arithmetic, or function calls and are not controlling expressions; there are no loops or switch statements in this function that could contain invariant controlling expressions. Consequently no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
