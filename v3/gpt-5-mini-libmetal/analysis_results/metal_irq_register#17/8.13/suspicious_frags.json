  "explanation": "I selected all code fragments that declare or use pointer types to non-const data (function pointer typedef taking a void *arg, the metal_irq_register signature with void *arg, local pointer declarations, the place where an irq data pointer is computed, and the assignment of arg into irq_data). These are the locations most likely to require investigation for Rule 8.13 (whether pointers should be to const-qualified types). Other fragments in the provided code were not included because they do not present pointer-to-object declarations that could reasonably be const-qualified, or they clearly perform operations that require mutable access: for example, NULL checks (e.g. checking cntr or cntr->irqs), integer computations of irq_base/irq_end, calls/returns, and assignments that intentionally modify data members (such as setting the handler field). Those constructs either are not pointer type declarations subject to const qualification or clearly require a non-const target, so they do not need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
