  "explanation": "No usage of the Standard Library string handling functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appears in the provided function. The code only performs a NULL check on cntr, iterates a list via metal_list_for_each, calls metal_irq_allocate, assigns irq_base, and adds to the list with metal_list_add_tail. There are no direct calls to <string.h> functions or pointer parameters passed to such functions in this fragment. Indirect calls (metal_irq_allocate, metal_list_add_tail, or the metal_list_for_each macro) could internally use string functions, but those implementations are outside the provided code and must be inspected separately; they are not part of this fragment and therefore are not flagged here."
