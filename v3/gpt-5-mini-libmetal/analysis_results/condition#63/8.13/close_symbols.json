  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201ca pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d you must know the exact pointer parameter types and whether the called routines modify the pointed-to objects. Brief rationale for each symbol:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (declaration & implementation): condition passes tids and &ts_created to this function. You must see its prototype (parameter types and const qualifiers) and body to determine whether it writes into the tids array or to the pointed ts_created. If it does not modify a buffer, its parameter should be const; if it does, const is inappropriate.\n\n- metal_run (declaration & implementation): condition calls metal_run with a thread routine; inspect its prototype and implementation to know what pointer types it takes (e.g. argument pointer to thread start) and whether it modifies data passed through that pointer \u2014 this affects whether those pointer parameters could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- metal_finish_threads (declaration & implementation): condition passes (void *)tids to it (note the cast). You need its real parameter type and implementation to see whether it mutates the tids array (or reads only). That determines whether the parameter type should be const-qualified and whether the cast/loss of const is problematic.\n\n- producer_thread (declaration & implementation): passed as a thread-start routine (function pointer) via metal_run/metal_run_noblock. You need its signature and body to see whether its parameter(s) modify any pointed-to data; that will show whether the thread-start pointer type could accept const pointer arguments.\n\n- consumer_thread (declaration & implementation): same reasons as producer_thread \u2014 inspect signature/body to know whether pointers used are mutated and whether const qualification is possible.\n\n- thread-start typedef used by metal_run/metal_run_noblock (if present): many thread frameworks use a typedef for the start routine (e.g. void *(*)(void *)). You need the typedef to know what pointer-to-data type the API expects and whether that typedef uses const; if the typedef lacks const but implementations do not modify data, the typedef itself may violate MISRA.\n\n- pthread_t typedef / <pthread.h> header: tids is an array of pthread_t; you need to know the exact typedef/representation to check whether passing pthread_t * (or casting to void *) interacts with const qualifications and whether const would be applicable to that type.\n\n- THREADS macro/constant definition: gives the array size and confirms the type of tids (pthread_t[THREADS]). While not directly about const, it helps reason about array-to-pointer decay and whether APIs should accept a pointer-to-const-array or pointer-to-non-const.\n\nCollecting these prototypes and implementations lets the next analyzer determine precisely which pointer parameters are read-only and therefore should be const-qualified (or correctly cast), and whether the current calls/casts in condition violate MISRA\u2019s const-pointer guidance."
