  "scenario": "Declaration of an array of pthread_t: pthread_t tids[THREADS]; does not in itself use any compiler language extension. pthread_t is a POSIX type (library type) and array declaration is standard C provided THREADS is a compile-time constant. This does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. (If THREADS were not a compile-time constant resulting in a variable-length array, that is a standard C99 feature \u2014 only report if your compiler explicitly documents VLA as a non\u2011standard extension.)"
