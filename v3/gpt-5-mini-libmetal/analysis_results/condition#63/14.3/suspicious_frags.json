  "explanation": "No control statements in this function use invariant (constant) controlling expressions. The conditional checks are the four occurrences of\nif (ret < 0) { ... }\nbut each follows an assignment to ret (from metal_run_noblock or metal_run), so the controlling expression depends on a variable value and is not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant/immutable controlling expressions, and the goto label/out return sequence is not a controlling expression. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
