  "explanation": "- metal_run_noblock: The function return is assigned to 'ret' and immediately used in controlling expressions (if (ret < 0)). To determine whether those if conditions are invariant you must inspect metal_run_noblock's implementation, return-value logic, use of global state, and attributes (e.g. const/pure/inline) that could make its result a compile-time or run-time invariant.\n\n- metal_run: Same reason as metal_run_noblock \u2014 it sets 'ret' used in conditionals. metal_run also calls metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads (per the call graph), so its implementation is required to understand inter-call effects and whether its return can ever vary.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Although not used directly in a conditional here, metal_finish_threads may change global state or block, affecting subsequent calls and return values of metal_run/_noblock (thus affecting whether the later controlling expressions can vary). Provide its implementation and side-effects.\n\n- THREADS: The numeric value of THREADS (macro/constant) affects the arguments passed to the run functions (e.g. zero threads vs. >0). If THREADS is a compile-time constant such as 0 or 1 that makes called routines behave deterministically, the conditionals using 'ret' might become invariant. The definition is required.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread: These function objects are passed into the thread-run helpers. Their behavior (side-effects on shared/global state) can affect the behavior/return values of metal_run/_noblock. Provide prototypes and relevant behavior (do they terminate, block, change globals used by metal_run?).\n\n- metal_log: Provide its definition/macros because it might be a macro or implementation that performs non-local control flow (e.g. abort/longjmp) or otherwise affects reachability of the controlling expressions; confirm it does not make the conditionals effectively invariant by altering control flow.\n\nNote: To decide MISRA R-14.4 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) you must show that each controlling expression (here the if (ret < 0) tests) cannot be proven to be invariant at compile time. The above symbols are those whose prototypes/implementations, macros, or global-state interactions can make those controlling expressions constant (invariant) or affect their variability."
