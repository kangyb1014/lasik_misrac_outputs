  "explanation": "For checking reachability (MISRA: no unreachable code) you must know whether any called symbol or compile-time constant can make later code nondeterministically non\u2011reachable (e.g. never return, abort, longjmp, or otherwise transfer control away). Brief reasons for each symbol: \n\n- metal_run_noblock: Needed to know its return/exit semantics, error conventions and side effects (does it ever call exit/abort/longjmp or is it annotated noreturn?). Also whether it can block forever or never return \u2014 if it does, code after its call becomes unreachable.\n\n- metal_run: Same as above. In particular metal_run is invoked in the middle of the function; if metal_run is non\u2011returning or always blocks/aborts on success/failure, subsequent statements would be unreachable. Also need to know whether metal_run internally calls metal_run_noblock/metal_finish_threads (call graph hints it might) and whether it returns to caller.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Needed to know whether this function returns normally or can block forever/abort/longjmp (making following code unreachable). Also its semantics for waiting affect whether later code can execute.\n\n- metal_log: Logging functions sometimes terminate the program on fatal errors. You must know whether metal_log ever does not return (or calls exit/longjmp) for the error logging paths used here; if it never returns the goto/return flow is affected.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The severity macro may imply different behavior (e.g. fatal vs non\u2011fatal). Knowing its meaning determines whether the metal_log call on error could cause non\u2011returning behavior.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread: Their implementations are required only insofar as they could call exit/abort in a way that affects the main thread, or be used by metal_run/_noblock in a manner that changes control flow (for example if metal_run waits for threads and threads call exit). If threads can cause process termination or change return behaviour of the thread management APIs, that impacts reachability.\n\n- THREADS: The compile\u2011time value may affect control flow (e.g. THREADS==0 could make thread creation calls no\u2011ops or return immediately); you need its value to reason about whether the sequence of calls is executed and whether arrays/loops behave as expected (zero-length operations sometimes have special behavior in thread APIs).\n\nIn short: to decide whether any part of condition() is unreachable you must inspect the prototypes, attributes (e.g. __noreturn), documented return/error behavior, and any side effects (exit/abort/longjmp/blocking) of the above functions and the compile\u2011time THREADS constant."
