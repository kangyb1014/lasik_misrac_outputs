  "explanation": "Fragments not included do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const-qualified pointer types or are not pointer declarations/uses that could be made const: - The function parameter \"const char *format\" is already const-qualified. - The static array \"static const char * const level_strs[] = { ... };\" uses const for both the pointed-to characters and the array of pointers. - The enum \"enum metal_log_level\" and the scalar parameter \"level\" are non-pointer types. - The casts (void)level and (void)format in the #else branch are no-ops and involve no pointer declarations. The selected fragments warrant inspection because they involve objects that are (or decay to) pointer types when used (msg decays to char *, va_list is often implemented as or contains a pointer, and both vsnprintf and fprintf accept pointer arguments via variadic parameters), so they may conceal const-qualification issues (e.g. qualifier loss when passing const data through variadic arguments or use of non-const pointers where const could be applied)."
