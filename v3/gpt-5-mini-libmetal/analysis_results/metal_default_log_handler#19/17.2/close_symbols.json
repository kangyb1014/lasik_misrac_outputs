  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking indirect recursion to metal_default_log_handler:\n\n- DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON\n  - Controls whether the body that performs calls (vsnprintf, fprintf) is compiled. You must know its value to decide if any calls exist at all.\n\n- vsnprintf\n  - Directly called by metal_default_log_handler. To prove there is no indirect recursion you must inspect vsnprintf's implementation (or its call graph) to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_default_log_handler.\n\n- vfprintf\n  - Commonly used/internal routine that vsnprintf may call. If vsnprintf delegates to vfprintf (or a similar helper), that helper must be examined for potential calls back to the logger.\n\n- fprintf\n  - Directly called by metal_default_log_handler. Its implementation (or the implementation of functions it calls) must be checked for any path that could call metal_default_log_handler.\n\n- stderr\n  - The stream object passed to fprintf; some implementations dispatch I/O via function pointers or handlers associated with FILE/stream objects. You need to inspect how fprintf uses stderr to determine any indirect calls (e.g., stream hooks) that might invoke the logger.\n\n- fwrite, fputs, write\n  - Examples of lower-level I/O functions that fprintf/vfprintf or the stdio implementation may call. These (and other low-level output routines) must be examined because an indirect recursion could flow through these routines back into the logging code.\n\n- enum metal_log_level\n  - The type of the parameter; you must know its definition to reason about the value space and the bounds test that selects the level index. (Not directly relevant to recursion but necessary to fully analyze control flow of the function.)\n\n- METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY, METAL_LOG_DEBUG\n  - The enum constants used in the bounds check that can change control flow; include them so the analyzer can determine which array index is used and whether any side effects could cause calls.\n\n- va_list / va_start / va_end\n  - The varargs macros/types used to forward arguments to vsnprintf. They are not functions themselves, but the analyzer should know they do not introduce calls to metal_default_log_handler and how arguments are forwarded to vsnprintf.\n\nNotes:\n- The core need is to inspect every function that metal_default_log_handler calls (vsnprintf, fprintf) and then recursively inspect the functions they call (vfprintf, fwrite, write, etc.) to ensure none eventually call metal_default_log_handler. The items above list the immediate callees and the common lower-level routines or symbols that an implementation of the C library might involve and therefore must be included in the call-graph inspection."
