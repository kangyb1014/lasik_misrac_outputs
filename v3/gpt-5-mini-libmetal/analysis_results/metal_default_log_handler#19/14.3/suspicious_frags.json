  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are obviously invariant. The only C-level control statement is: if (level <= METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY || level > METAL_LOG_DEBUG) which depends on the function parameter 'level' and therefore is not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements in this function whose controlling expressions could be constant; the only other conditional is the preprocessor #ifdef DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON, which is a compile-time preprocessor directive rather than a C controlling expression covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3. Thus there are no fragments that need investigation under Rule 14.3."
