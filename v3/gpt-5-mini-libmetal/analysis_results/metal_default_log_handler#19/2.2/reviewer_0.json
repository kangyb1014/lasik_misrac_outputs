  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The two statements \"(void)level;\" and \"(void)format;\" (executed when DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON is not defined) are expression-statements with no side effects; removing them does not change program behaviour at run-time. Under the plain wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), these statements qualify as dead code and therefore violate Rule 2.2. Note: this pattern is commonly used to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters; however, suppression of compiler diagnostics does not change the runtime behaviour test in Rule 2.2. Remediations include omitting parameter names in the function definition, using a compiler-supported attribute to mark parameters as unused, or using an approved project-wide annotation/pragmas that are permitted by your project's MISRA compliance justification."
