  "explanation": "- metal_log (declaration and full implementation/source): The target function itself does not call any <string.h> routine, but it calls metal_log with a string literal. To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA <string.h> rule you must inspect metal_log (and everything it calls) to see if it uses any of the prohibited/checked string functions and whether those uses are performed with correct bounds checks.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum definition): The macro could expand into code or select a different logging path that uses string operations; its definition is needed to know which logging implementation is invoked.\n- message string literal \"No more available soft irqs\\n\": The literal is passed to metal_log; you must verify how that pointer/format is consumed (e.g., copied, concatenated) in the logging implementation to check for out-of-bounds accesses.\n- metal_softirq_avail (declaration and type): Confirming this is an integer (not a pointer/array) shows the function does not manipulate character buffers itself. If it were or aliased to buffer metadata, that could affect string-handling analysis.\n- metal_softirq_num (declaration and type): Same rationale as metal_softirq_avail \u2014 verify it is not a character buffer or indirect source of pointer arithmetic that leads to string operations.\n- metal_softirq_cntr (structure/type definition and irq_base member type): The code adds irq_base from this struct; its type must be known to ensure no hidden pointer/array semantics or casts to character pointers are involved that could cause string accesses.\n- EINVAL (macro definition): Included for completeness to see headers pulled in or macros that might indirectly introduce string-using code; not likely to trigger the string rule but useful for complete context.\n- Any string-handling functions that metal_log (or its callees) may call (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn \u2014 and their prototypes/implementations): If metal_log (or deeper callees) calls any of these, their call sites must be inspected for correct source/target sizes and bounds checks. The MISRA rule applies to those specific standard string functions, so knowing whether and how they are used is necessary to conclude compliance.\n\nIn short: the only possible MISRA <string.h> concern in this function is via the logging call and its dependencies \u2014 therefore the logging symbols and any string functions used by the logging path (plus the variable/type declarations used in this function to rule out hidden buffer semantics) are required for analysis."
