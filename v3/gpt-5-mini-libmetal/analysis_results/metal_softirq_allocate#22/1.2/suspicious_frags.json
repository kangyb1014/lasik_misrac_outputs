  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __volatile__ (in an implementation-specific sense), or other vendor-specific extensions.\n- There are no GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions, nor are there label-as-values constructs or inline assembly blocks.\n- There are no compiler-specific pragmas or #pragma directives shown in the fragment.\n- Use of the macro EINVAL and the call to metal_log are normal C constructs (macros/functions) and not language extensions; returning a negated macro (return -EINVAL;) is valid standard C expression usage, not a compiler extension.\n- Accessing a structure member (metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base) and declaring a local int irq_base are standard C; although a global symbol with the same name (shadowing) may be a concern for other MISRA rules, it is not a compiler language-extension issue covered by Rule 1.2.\n\nIf the build uses compiler-specific headers or the symbols (metal_log, EINVAL, metal_softirq_cntr) are implemented via compiler intrinsics or macros that rely on extensions, those implementation files would need inspection. Based solely on the shown source, there are no language extensions to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
