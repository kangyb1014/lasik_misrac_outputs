  "explanation": "Required symbols and why:\n- metal_log: The target function directly calls metal_log. To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion we must inspect metal_log (its definition and its transitive call graph) to ensure it does not call back to metal_softirq_allocate (directly or via other functions).\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: This token may be a macro or enum that affects how metal_log is invoked (it could expand to code or select different logging code paths). If it expands to a function-like construct or changes the call target, that could introduce a call chain; include its definition to be safe.\n- metal_softirq_avail, metal_softirq_num, metal_softirq_cntr: Although these are data symbols, their definitions/types must be known to rule out any disguised function calls (for example, if accessors/macros or function-pointer fields are involved). In particular, verify that metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base is a plain data member and not a macro or function call.\n- EINVAL: An integer macro constant; included for completeness so the analyzer has all referenced symbols. It does not affect recursion but completing symbol resolution avoids missing macro-induced calls.\n\nPrimary analysis focus: resolve metal_log (and all functions it calls transitively). If metal_log (or anything it calls) eventually calls metal_softirq_allocate, that would violate the MISRA rule."
