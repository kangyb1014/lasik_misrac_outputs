  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in metal_softirq_allocate are syntactically unreachable under all possible program states you must know the properties of the symbols that control the branch and the call that might alter control flow:\n\n- metal_softirq_avail (declaration/definition, type, qualifiers, initializer if any): the if condition and the code after the if depend on this global. If this variable is const, has a fixed initializer, or has a constrained range that makes the condition always true (or always false) then portions of the function might be provably unreachable. The type and signedness matter for overflow/undefined behaviour analysis.\n\n- metal_softirq_num (declaration/definition, type, qualifiers, initializer if any): paired with metal_softirq_avail in the conditional. Its const/initializer/annotations determine whether the branch can ever evaluate both ways; needed to prove or disprove reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr and irq_base (declaration/definition and member type/initializer): the function computes and returns irq_base using metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base. If the struct or member is const or otherwise fixed at compile time that could affect reachability reasoning or indicate dead code elsewhere; its type is also required to reason about arithmetic/overflow.\n\n- metal_log (prototype/definition including attributes): metal_log is called right before the early return. If metal_log is declared/implemented as a non\u2011returning function (noreturn/longjmp/exit/abort) then everything after that call could be unreachable. You need its prototype/implementation or attribute annotations to determine whether control can continue to the return statement or beyond.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/definition): the macro itself does not usually affect reachability, but its definition can reveal if it expands to something that changes control flow (for example, combining logging with an abort or longjmp). Include it so the logging call expansion can be inspected.\n\n- Annotations/invariants or range constraints on metal_softirq_avail, metal_softirq_num and parameter num: any static assertions, comments, typedefs, or analysis annotations that impose value ranges (e.g. always non\u2011negative, bounded by a constant) are required to prove that the conditional can or cannot be satisfied for any input. Also needed to reason about possible signed overflow of (metal_softirq_avail + num).\n\nThese symbols (their declarations/definitions/annotations) are the minimal set required to determine whether any lines in metal_softirq_allocate are unreachable for all possible program states or whether non\u2011local control flow from the logging call makes later code unreachable."
