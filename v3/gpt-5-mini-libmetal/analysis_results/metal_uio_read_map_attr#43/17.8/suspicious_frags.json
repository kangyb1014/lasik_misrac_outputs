  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The only write through a parameter is '*value = ...', which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (this is allowed by the rule). The pointer parameters themselves are not reassigned or assigned to (ldev, index, name, value are never assigned new values). 'name' is declared const so it cannot be modified. The local variable 'cls' is initialized from ldev->cls_path but does not modify 'ldev' itself. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
