Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "You must examine the target function plus any functions it calls because the MISRA rule counts the behaviour of called functions as part of a for-loop body. For each symbol below I explain why it is needed to determine whether any for-loops reachable from metal_uio_read_map_attr are well-formed:\n\n- snprintf: Called to build the path. Its implementation may contain for-loops; any loop there is part of the called-function behaviour and must be checked for the MISRA for-loop well-formedness constraints.\n\n- strtoul: Called to parse attr->value. Its implementation may contain for-loops (parsing loops); these loops must be checked for compliance since they execute as part of the function.\n\n- sysfs_open_attribute: Opens/allocates the attribute object. Its implementation may contain for-loops or may initialize objects that are later used/modified; inspect for-loops there and for any modification of objects used in for-loop clauses in callers.\n\n- sysfs_read_attribute: Reads into attr->value and returns a status. Its implementation is especially important: it may contain for-loops that operate on attr->value (or other shared objects). Any such loops are part of the behaviour invoked by metal_uio_read_map_attr and must be checked for well-formedness and for modifying objects referenced in potential for-loop clauses.\n\n- sysfs_close_attribute: Closes/frees the attribute. Its implementation may include loops (e.g., cleanup loops) that need inspection.\n\n- struct sysfs_attribute: Needed to know the type and lifetime of attr->value (e.g., array, pointer, mutable object). That determines whether any for-loop clauses in called functions use or modify objects that are also modified elsewhere in the loop body (important for clause 2/3 and the single-loop-counter rule).\n\n- struct linux_device: Needed to know the type of ldev->cls_path (pointer/array) and whether accessing it could alias or be modified by called functions; also for understanding any side effects or invariants used by called code.\n\n- SYSFS_PATH_MAX: The buffer size used for path. Knowing its value is necessary to inspect snprintf usage and to determine if any loops in snprintf/related code depend on this macro (and whether for-loop clauses might involve objects modified in the loop body).\n\n- errno: The function returns -errno on error. errno is a global that may be modified by called functions; if analysing for-loops that use globals or rely on errno as loop control, we must know its semantics and where it is set.\n\n- EOVERFLOW: Macro used on snprintf overflow detection; include it so the analyser can understand the error path taken (and thus which callees run) when overflow occurs. This affects reachability of code paths containing for-loops.\n\nNote: The primary focus is the bodies of the called functions (snprintf, strtoul, sysfs_*). If their implementations are in libraries outside the project (e.g., libc), you must obtain their source/implementations or a project-specific wrapper implementation to fully check MISRA for-loop compliance. The struct definitions and macros are needed to reason about aliasing, buffer sizes and whether objects used in loop clauses are modified in loop bodies or by called functions."
