Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Provide the minimal symbols whose definitions can introduce or change for-loop behaviour when analyzing the target for the MISRA for-loop rule:\n\n- struct metal_device (definition)\n  Reason: The target dereferences device members (name, num_regions, node, bus). If any of these members are implemented via macros, inline functions, or have types with embedded behaviour (e.g. node as an inline container), their definitions can introduce for-loops or side effects into the target function textually/semantically.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (definition / macro expansion)\n  Reason: This is invoked in the target. If it is a macro or an inline function it will expand into the target function body; such an expansion could contain for-loops (or modify loop counters/objects). To decide MISRA conformance we must inspect its actual definition/expansion.\n\n- struct metal_list (definition) / type of generic_device_list\n  Reason: generic_device_list is passed to metal_list_add_tail. If list operations are implemented as macros or inline code operating on this type, their definitions may contain for-loops or modify objects used in loops; we need the type to interpret any expansions.\n\n- struct metal_list_node (definition) / type of device->node\n  Reason: device->node is passed into list manipulation. The node type definition may include macros/inline helpers that expand into loops or affect objects that could be used as loop counters/flags.\n\n- _metal (global) and its type (definition) \u2014 especially common.generic_device_list\n  Reason: _metal.common.generic_device_list is the actual list object used here. Its definition (and any associated macros/inline helpers) could include code that expands into loops; need to know whether accessing it invokes macros or inline code.\n\n- metal_generic_bus (definition)\n  Reason: Assigned to device->bus. While unlikely to contain loops, its type/definition is necessary to ensure the assignment does not involve macros or inline functions that could expand into for-loops or modify loop-related objects.\n\n- strlen (declaration/inline definition)\n  Reason: strlen is called in the conditional. Some implementations provide strlen as a macro or inline function; if so it could include loops. To be sure the target function itself contains no for-loop (or that any loops are acceptable), inspect the actual strlen implementation used.\n\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro)\n  Reason: The numeric limit appears in the conditional. If this macro expands to an expression (or function-like macro) with side effects or uses identifiers that interact with loop logic, it could affect MISRA analysis.\n\n- EINVAL (macro)\n  Reason: The return value is a macro; include for completeness to confirm it does not expand to code with side effects. (Unlikely, but included to be exhaustive.)\n\nSummary: The crucial items are the full definitions/expansions of metal_list_add_tail and the list/list-node/_metal types because they can be macros/inline routines that become part of the target function body and could introduce for-loops or modify loop counters/flags. The other symbols ensure no hidden macros/inline code in standard functions or macros introduce for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA Rule compliance."
