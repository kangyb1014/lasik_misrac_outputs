  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the parameter pointer 'device' itself. The function only reads fields (device->name, device->num_regions) and modifies objects pointed to by the parameter (device->bus = &metal_generic_bus; and passing &device->node to metal_list_add_tail which may update the node structure). Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer value (e.g., assigning to 'device' or changing the pointer). There is no assignment to 'device' nor any operation that changes the pointer value in this function, so no fragments need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
