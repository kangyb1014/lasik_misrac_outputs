  "explanation": "1) metal_irq_get_controller: Needed to confirm its prototype and behavior. Although it takes irq by value, reviewing its declaration/definition ensures it is not a macro or inline that could somehow modify the caller's parameter (via weird macro expansion or by reference through global variables).  \n\n2) struct metal_irq_controller (full type/definition): Required to see the exact declaration of the member irq_set_enable (its type and signature). The MISRA rule concerns modifying function parameters; to decide if passing irq and state to irq_set_enable could violate the rule we must know the member's type.  \n\n3) metal_irq_controller::irq_set_enable (the member function-pointer declaration/type): You must confirm the parameter types of irq_set_enable (e.g., whether it takes int/unsigned int by value or pointers). If it expects pointers (or is a macro that takes addresses), then passing the local parameters might enable modification of the original objects and change the analysis. If it takes values, it cannot modify the caller's formal parameters.  \n\n4) implementations/assignments of irq_set_enable (the functions assigned to that function-pointer): If the function-pointer can point to different implementation functions, inspect those implementations to ensure none rely on non-standard calling conventions or macros that could indirectly modify the caller's parameters (or rely on side effects that would be relevant to the MISRA check).  \n\n5) any macros that expand to irq_set_enable or that rename/replace the call: A macro could expand in a way that writes to local parameter names or uses them as l-values; checking for such macros ensures the invocation in this function is not secretly performing an assignment to the formal parameters.  \n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether irq or state are directly or indirectly modified within _metal_irq_set_enable, and therefore whether the function breaches the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified."
