  "explanation": "The function _metal_irq_set_enable contains no calls to any of the string.h functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). It only calls metal_irq_get_controller and then invokes a controller function pointer cntr->irq_set_enable after a NULL check. There are no buffer accesses, pointer arithmetic, array indexing, or explicit memory/string operations in this fragment that could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to string.h usage. The only indirect call (cntr->irq_set_enable) could, in its own implementation elsewhere, use string functions incorrectly, but that code is not present in this fragment and therefore is outside the scope of this inspection. For these reasons, there are no code fragments in the provided function that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
