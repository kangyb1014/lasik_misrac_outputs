  "explanation": "- metal_irq_get_controller: The target calls this function and it is the first place to search for any use of memcmp (or other string comparisons). If metal_irq_get_controller uses memcmp to locate a controller by name, that could violate the rule. Include its full definition and any helper functions it calls.\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition): The structure declares the irq_set_enable function pointer. You need the type and definition to find where and how irq_set_enable is assigned and to identify candidate implementations.\n- irq_set_enable implementations (all functions assigned to metal_irq_controller->irq_set_enable): The target invokes this function pointer (cntr->irq_set_enable). Any implementation reachable here might call memcmp incorrectly (e.g., comparing NUL-terminated strings with memcmp). Include every function that can be assigned to irq_set_enable so they can be inspected for memcmp usage.\n- metal_irq_register: It appears in the call graph related to controller lookup/registration. Registration/initialization code often contains string comparisons or assignments of irq_set_enable; include it to discover assignments and any memcmp use.\n- memcmp (standard library function): Include the declaration/usages (or search symbol) so the analyzer can identify every occurrence and determine whether memcmp is applied to NUL-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n- any controller-registration/initialization functions that assign irq_set_enable pointers: If controller instances are created elsewhere, those functions must be inspected to find irq_set_enable assignments and any string comparisons (memcmp) performed during registration.\n\nInclude the full source bodies for the above symbols so the next agent can determine whether memcmp is used and, if so, whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (a MISRA violation)."
