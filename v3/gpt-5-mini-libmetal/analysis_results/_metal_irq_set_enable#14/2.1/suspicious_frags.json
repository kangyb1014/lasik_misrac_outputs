  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Control flow is straightforward: cntr is assigned from metal_irq_get_controller(irq); if cntr is NULL the function returns (reachable), otherwise the call cntr->irq_set_enable(cntr, irq, state) is executed (also reachable). There are no statements placed after an unconditional return, no mutually exclusive branches that render code textually unreachable, and no dead code introduced by preprocessor conditions in the supplied fragment. Note: a NULL irq_set_enable function pointer would cause a runtime fault but does not make the call site unreachable, so it is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) and therefore does not require reporting here."
