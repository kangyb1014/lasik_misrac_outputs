  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. The three selected fragments are the only places in this snippet where a pointer to a metal_irq_controller is declared, obtained, and passed to another function \u2014 these are the relevant locations to check whether the pointer (or the pointee type) could/should be const-qualified. Other lines in the snippet (the function signature, the NULL check 'if (cntr == NULL) { return; }', and the return statement) do not introduce or use pointer types in a way that bears on Rule 8.13, so they need not be investigated here. The definitions/signatures of metal_irq_get_controller and irq_set_enable are external to this snippet and should be reviewed separately to determine whether their parameter types require const qualification; they are not part of the provided code fragment and therefore are not included above."
