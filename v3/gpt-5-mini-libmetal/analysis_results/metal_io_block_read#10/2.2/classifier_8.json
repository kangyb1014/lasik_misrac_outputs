  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_block_read:\n```c\nint metal_io_block_read(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       void *restrict dst, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tunsigned char *dest = dst;\n\tint retlen;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_read) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_read)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, dst, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t\twhile ( len && (\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)dest % sizeof(int)) ||\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)))) {\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)dest =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)ptr;\n\t\t\tdest++;\n\t\t\tptr++;\n\t\t\tlen--;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); dest += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)dest = *(const unsigned int *)ptr;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; dest++, ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)dest =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)ptr;\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_io_block_read:\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nretlen = (*io->ops.block_read)( io, offset, dst, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to (*io->ops.block_read)(...) is executed only when io->ops.block_read is non-NULL and returns/produces the block read result into retlen; it can perform device-specific I/O, side-effects and timing important in embedded systems, and changing/removing it would change program behaviour. Only if it could be proven across the whole project that io->ops.block_read is never set or is a no-op identical to the else branch would it be dead code, but no such proof is present here."
