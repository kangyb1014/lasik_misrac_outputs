  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required to check for direct/indirect recursion:\n\n- metal_io_virt: metal_io_block_read calls metal_io_virt. To determine whether a recursive cycle exists we must examine metal_io_virt's body to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_io_block_read or any function that leads back to it.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (definition): metal_io_block_read accesses io->size and io->ops. Knowing the exact struct layout and types is necessary to identify the ops field and the block_read pointer, and to locate all places that assign callbacks into that ops structure.\n\n- io->ops type / ops struct definition (block_read function-pointer declaration): The type and declaration of the ops struct (the block_read function-pointer signature) are required to enumerate and identify which functions can be used as block_read callbacks and to find their definitions for recursion analysis.\n\n- all implementations assigned to ops.block_read (block_read callbacks): metal_io_block_read may call a callback via io->ops.block_read. Any implementation assigned to that pointer could call back into metal_io_block_read (indirect recursion). You must inspect every concrete implementation that can be assigned to block_read to ensure none call metal_io_block_read (directly or via other calls).\n\n- metal_io_block_write, metal_io_block_set, shmem_child: These functions are listed as callers of metal_io_virt in the static graph. Even though metal_io_virt currently shows no callees, to be safe you must inspect these related functions (and any code paths involving them) to ensure there is no transitive path that could create a cycle back to metal_io_block_read.\n\n- any functions called by metal_io_virt (its callees): If metal_io_virt calls other functions, those callees must be examined for paths that could reach metal_io_block_read. The presence of any such path constitutes indirect recursion.\n\nIn short: inspect metal_io_virt and the ops.block_read callback implementations (and any functions reachable from metal_io_virt) plus the ops/region type definitions. These are the minimal additional symbols needed to determine whether metal_io_block_read can end up calling itself (directly or indirectly)."
