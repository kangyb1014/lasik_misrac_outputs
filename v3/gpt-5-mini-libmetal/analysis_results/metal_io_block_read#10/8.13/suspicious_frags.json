  "explanation": "Only pointers that are used purely for reading or otherwise never modified should be considered for qualification with const. The code uses 'ptr' only as a source (reads from it) and the code repeatedly casts its dereferences to const, which suggests the underlying pointer or the value returned by metal_io_virt might be a candidate for const qualification\u2014hence those fragments are flagged. The function parameter 'io' is also flagged because the function does not modify the region object and could plausibly take a pointer to const; this requires investigation because changing it could affect API usage (e.g. callbacks). Other pointers and expressions do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'dst' / 'dest' are write targets and therefore must be non-const; casts of 'dest' to unsigned char*/unsigned int* are used to perform writes and alignment-specific copying and so are not candidates for const qualification; integer variables, arithmetic, fence and loop constructs are unrelated to pointer const-qualification and thus need not be investigated for Rule 8.13."
