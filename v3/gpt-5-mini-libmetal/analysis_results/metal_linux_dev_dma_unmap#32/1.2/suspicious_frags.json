  "explanation": "The remaining code uses standard C features only: function declarations/definitions, pointer dereferencing, structure member access, standard fixed-width integer type (uint32_t), and a regular function-pointer call. There are no visible inline assembly blocks, GCC/clang-specific attributes, statement expressions, typeof usages, nested functions, zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific language extensions in the shown fragments (other than the two metal_container_of invocations, which are flagged for inspection because container_of-style macros commonly rely on compiler extensions). Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
