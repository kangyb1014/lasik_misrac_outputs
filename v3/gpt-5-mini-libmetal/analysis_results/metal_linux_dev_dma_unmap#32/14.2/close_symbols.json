Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- to_linux_device (definition/macro): The target calls this helper to obtain 'ldev'. Its implementation could contain for loops (or side effects) relevant to the MISRA for\u2011loop rule; we must inspect it to ensure no ill-formed for loops or persistent side effects violating the rule.\n\n- to_linux_bus (definition/macro): Same reason as above for obtaining 'lbus' \u2014 its body may contain for loops or side effects that must be checked.\n\n- struct linux_device (definition): The target dereferences 'ldev->ldrv'. We need the struct layout to confirm the type and presence of the 'ldrv' member and to know the exact type to inspect its members for loops.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): The object 'lbus' is passed into the driver callback; its definition may reveal inline functions, macros, or operations used by callees that include for loops or modify objects relevant to loop clauses.\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition) / type of ldev->ldrv: This is the type of the 'ldrv' field. We must see this definition to find the 'dev_dma_unmap' member and its declared type (function pointer) and to understand ownership/semantics that affect whether loop counters/objects may be modified.\n\n- declaration of ldrv->dev_dma_unmap (function\u2011pointer type/signature): The target invokes this function pointer. Its signature is required to locate implementations and to reason about side effects and whether any for loops inside it (or in functions it calls) violate MISRA rules. Also needed to know which parameters are passed (so we can determine which objects may be modified inside the callee).\n\n- implementations assigned to ldrv->dev_dma_unmap (driver-specific functions): The actual code executed at runtime is in driver implementations assigned to this pointer. Those implementations (and their callees) must be inspected for any for loops and to check the three clauses and loop\u2011counter usage per MISRA. Because this is an indirect call, the implementations are essential for a complete analysis.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): Provided as a parameter; its definition can reveal casts, inline helpers, or macros used by to_linux_bus/to_linux_device or by driver code that may contain for loops or modify loop variables.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): Provided as a parameter and used to derive 'ldev' via to_linux_device; its layout or helpers/macros could contain for loops or side effects relevant to the rule.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): Passed through to the dev_dma_unmap callback; its definition and any helper functions/macros that operate on it might contain for loops that must be checked under MISRA rules.\n\nNotes: The target function itself has no for loop, but MISRA requires that the behaviour of called functions be considered (the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement). Therefore, to determine compliance for the target function we must examine the definitions/implementations of the two helper conversions and especially the driver callback (ldrv->dev_dma_unmap) and any types/helpers they use. Inspecting these symbols will allow checking for ill\u2011formed for loops, improper loop counters, persistent side effects in second clause, and modifications of loop counters inside bodies."
