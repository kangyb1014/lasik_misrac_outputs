  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap:\n```c\nstatic void metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t      uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t      int nents)\n{\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\n\tldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(lbus, ldev, dir, sg,\n\t\t\t\t       nents);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap:\nstruct linux_device {\n\tstruct metal_device\t\tdevice;\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_name[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tdev_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tchar\t\t\t\tcls_path[PATH_MAX];\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\t\tregion_phys[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS];\n\tstruct linux_driver\t\t*ldrv;\n\tstruct sysfs_device\t\t*sdev;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute\t\t*override;\n\tint\t\t\t\tfd;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t      uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t      struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t      int nents)\n{\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\n\tldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(lbus, ldev, dir, sg,\n\t\t\t\t       nents);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the function performs useful operations (casts device and bus to linux types and calls the driver unmap routine). The local assignments are used and the call is executed when this function is invoked, so removal would affect behaviour. Therefore, based on the provided code alone Rule 2.2 is not violated. (Note: if elsewhere in the project this function is never referenced/called, the function would be dead code \u2014 that situation cannot be determined from the fragment.)"
