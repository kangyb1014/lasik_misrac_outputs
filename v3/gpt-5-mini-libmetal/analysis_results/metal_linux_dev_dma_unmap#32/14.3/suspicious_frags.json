  "explanation": "No control statements are present in the provided function (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) operator). Therefore there are no controlling expressions to be invariant and MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not applicable. The function contains only local declarations and a single function pointer call (ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap), which is not a controlling expression. No infinite-loop or do-while constant-expression exceptions apply because no loops are present."
