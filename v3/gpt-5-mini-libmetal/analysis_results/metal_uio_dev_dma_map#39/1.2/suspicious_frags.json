  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 1.2 concern is use of compiler language extensions. The only constructs in this function that rely on a known compiler extension are pointer arithmetic operations performed on void * objects (pointer +/- integer). ISO C does not allow arithmetic on void *; many compilers (e.g. GCC) treat it as an extension. Other code constructs in the function do not constitute language extensions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 1.2: casts like (void)lbus and (void)dir, pointer comparisons, use of __func__, standard library calls (memcpy, metal_log), loop and indexing constructs, integer casts (e.g. (int)ldev->device.num_regions), and the return of -EINVAL are all standard C usage or project/library macros. Note: format-string/type mismatches (passing a pointer with %x) or potential runtime/semantic issues are not language extensions and are outside the scope of Rule 1.2, so they were not flagged here."
