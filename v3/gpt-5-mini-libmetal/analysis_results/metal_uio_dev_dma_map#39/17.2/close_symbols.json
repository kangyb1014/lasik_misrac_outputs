  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_uio_dev_dma_map violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion we must examine all functions it calls and their transitive callees to see if any path leads back to metal_uio_dev_dma_map. Specifically:\n\n- metal_log: This function is called directly by the target. You need its declaration and implementation or its call graph to determine whether metal_log (or something it calls) could call back into metal_uio_dev_dma_map, causing indirect recursion.\n\n- memcpy: Although typically a library routine that does not call application code, you must include its implementation or call graph (or a guarantee that it is a leaf routine) to rule out a call-back into the target.\n\n- vprintf / vsnprintf / printf / write (standard I/O functions): These are common callees of logging implementations. If metal_log uses any of these, their behaviours/call graphs must be known to ensure they do not invoke application callbacks that could lead to recursive calls.\n\n- struct linux_device, struct linux_bus, struct metal_sg, struct metal_io_region (declarations): While the structures themselves do not create recursion, any function pointers or callbacks stored in these structures (or in related registration code) could create indirect call paths back to the target. Their declarations help identify possible callback fields and where implementations may exist.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by metal_log and memcpy (transitive callee set): For full recursion analysis you must examine the entire transitive closure of callees starting from these two functions to ensure no path returns to metal_uio_dev_dma_map.\n\n- Any registered callbacks / function pointers stored in linux_device / linux_bus that can be invoked from other codepaths (declarations + implementations): Indirect recursion can occur through callbacks registered elsewhere in the system. You must include the implementations of any callbacks that could be invoked by the functions above or by other code reachable from them.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations/implementations or an accurate call graph) is necessary and sufficient to check whether any direct or indirect call chain beginning at metal_uio_dev_dma_map can lead back to itself."
