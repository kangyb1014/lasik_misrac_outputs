This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct metal_sg\n   - The function uses sizeof(struct metal_sg) to compute the byte count passed to memcpy and it indexes sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len. You must know the exact layout and size of struct metal_sg to determine the number of bytes copied and whether the computed size can cause memcpy to access beyond sg_out. Also the meaning of the virt/len fields can affect alias/overlap reasoning.\n\n2) struct linux_device\n   - The code reads ldev->device.num_regions and ldev->device.regions and uses ldev->dev_name in diagnostics. Knowing the layout of struct linux_device (especially where device and dev_name live) is required to reason about whether any of the memory referenced by sg_in/sg_out might alias or overlap device-owned regions, and to confirm that the MMIO checks do not affect the memcpy source/destination bounds.\n\n3) struct metal_io_region\n   - The function compares sg_in element addresses against io->virt and io->size. The types and sizes of io->virt and io->size (and their alignment/representation) are needed to verify the correctness of the bounds checks applied to sg_in and to reason about possible overlap between sg_in memory and other regions that could affect memcpy safety.\n\n4) memcpy (prototype / behavior from <string.h>)\n   - MISRA's rule targets use of string.h functions. You must have the standard definition/semantics of memcpy (notably that it copies exactly N bytes and that overlapping source/destination causes undefined behavior) to judge whether this call can violate the rule (out-of-bounds access or UB due to overlapping buffers). Include the standard prototype and the non-overlap requirement.\n\n5) API contract / callers' allocation guarantees for sg_in and sg_out (buffer sizes & ownership)\n   - The function assumes it is safe to copy nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) bytes into sg_out when sg_out != sg_in. Static analysis requires the callers' contract or the allocation sites that allocate sg_in and sg_out (or header documentation for this API) to determine whether sg_out is guaranteed to have at least nents_in elements, or whether partial/overlapping buffers could be passed. Without that contract or caller/allocation information you cannot determine if memcpy will access beyond the destination object or if overlapping copies could occur (which would also violate the rule)."
