  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" analysis:\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - Needed to see the exact types and qualifiers of members used (especially the virt member and len). The decision whether sg_in should be declared const struct metal_sg * depends on whether any fields are modified in this function and on the declared qualifiers of those fields (e.g., if virt is already const void *). Also required to determine whether assigning sg_in[i].virt to a local void * (vaddr_sg_lo) is type-compatible.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Required to know the types and qualifiers of io->virt and io->size. The function compares and does pointer arithmetic between sg_in[].virt and io->virt; whether those members are const-qualified affects whether the pointers in this function should be const-qualified and whether the current assignments are valid.\n\n- struct linux_device (including its embedded device member, num_regions and regions)\n  - Needed to see how regions is declared (pointer/array type and any const qualifiers) and the exact type of num_regions. If regions is declared as const struct metal_io_region * or similar, that constrains what pointer/qualification the code should use when reading region entries and comparing addresses. Also dev_name type affects logging but is less relevant to constness.\n\n- memcpy (prototype)\n  - The standard memcpy has signature void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n). Knowing that the source parameter is const void * is essential to decide whether passing sg_in as the source would be compatible if sg_in were declared const struct metal_sg *. It also helps determine whether copying sg_in->virt pointers would require casts if qualifiers differ.\n\n- metal_log (prototype)\n  - The logging call passes pointer values (vaddr_sg_lo) and the device name. Knowing metal_log's parameter types (e.g., whether it accepts const char * for format and variadic args) helps determine whether passing pointers that might be const-qualified would require casts. It also identifies whether the log call writes/changes any of the pointer arguments (unlikely, but must be confirmed).\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The macro/value used as the log level; included so the log call's prototype and invocation can be fully resolved (mainly to check type matching with constness of parameters passed to metal_log).\n\n- EINVAL\n  - The error macro value is referenced as a return; include to confirm it is an integer macro and does not affect pointer qualification analysis (mostly for completeness of semantic analysis).\n\nRationale for minimality: the const-qualification question pivots on the declarations of the structs and on the signatures of functions that accept pointers (memcpy, metal_log). With the exact definitions of struct metal_sg, struct metal_io_region and the device/regions declaration, plus memcpy/metal_log prototypes, an analyzer can determine whether sg_in (and/or sg_out, device.regions, and struct members like virt) should be declared pointing to const-qualified types and whether current uses violate MISRA's guideline."
