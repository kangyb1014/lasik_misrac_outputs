  "explanation": "To decide whether any executed operation in metal_dma_map is dead code, the analyzer must know the exact types, semantics and implementations that affect whether removing those operations would change program behaviour (including timing and concurrency effects). Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- struct metal_device: needed to determine the layout and semantics of dev, whether any fields (e.g. bus) can be null implicitly, and whether reading dev->bus has side-effects or undefined behaviour that would make the read non-removable.\n\n- struct metal_bus (type of dev->bus): required to know the bus object layout and whether accessing dev->bus (and its ops pointer) is observable or has side-effects; also to locate the ops pointer and its type.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (bus->ops) / dev_dma_map function pointer declaration: to know the exact prototype and calling conventions of dev_dma_map, and whether calling it has observable side-effects that prevent removal. Also used to determine whether the earlier null-check of dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map is sufficient and whether the function pointer could alias other effects.\n\n- dev_dma_map (implementation(s) or signature used at runtime): removing the call would be dead code only if the call has no observable effect. You must inspect the actual implementation(s) to decide if the call produces side-effects (DMA mappings, I/O, memory updates, synchronization, callbacks, etc.) or timing effects \u2014 so include the real runtime implementations or descriptions.\n\n- struct metal_sg: to understand whether passing sg_in/sg_out by pointer has observable side-effects (e.g. overlapping buffers, internal invariants) and whether reads/writes to these buffers matter for program behaviour; also to check whether any fields contain volatile/IO memory accesses that make operations non-removable.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: the constant that selects which memory fence is executed; its value and meaning are needed to know which branch runs and whether one branch may be unreachable or always taken (affecting whether the other fence is dead code).\n\n- atomic_thread_fence (project/platform implementation): central to the question \u2014 the fences are executed in the function. To decide if those fence calls are dead code you must know how atomic_thread_fence is implemented for the target (e.g. expands to a processor memory barrier instruction, a compiler barrier, or a no-op). If it is a no-op on the platform/configuration, the call may be dead; if it emits instructions or affects ordering with other threads/hardware, it is not dead.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: the fence semantics depend on these memory order enums/definitions. Their values and meaning (as defined in the project's atomic implementation) determine whether the chosen fence actually enforces ordering relevant to program behaviour.\n\n- stdatomic.h / project atomic implementation (headers/macros that define atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_*): in many embedded projects atomic_thread_fence may be provided via project-specific headers or macro wrappers; include the actual header/implementation used so the analyzer can see whether fences are real instructions, compile-time no-ops, or depend on build-time options (single-threaded build, optimization flags, architecture support).\n\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: include the error macros so the analyzer can confirm the return values and determine whether the early-return paths are meaningful/used by callers (this helps assess whether those return branches are reachable/useful or effectively dead in the application context).\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions lets the next analyser determine whether the fence calls, the dev_dma_map call, or any branch/return in metal_dma_map are operations whose removal would not change program behaviour (including concurrency and timing), and therefore whether they constitute dead code under the MISRA rule."
