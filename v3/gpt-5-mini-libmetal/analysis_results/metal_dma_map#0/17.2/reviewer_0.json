Example: somewhere dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map = metal_dma_map; then metal_dma_map -> dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map(...) -> metal_dma_map ... => indirect recursion (Rule 17.2 violation).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s scenario is theoretically possible in C (a function pointer call can produce indirect recursion if the pointer points back to the same function or to a chain that returns to it). However, in this code the call is through dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map that is expected to have a different prototype (it is invoked with dev->bus as the first argument) than metal_dma_map. Assigning metal_dma_map to that bus op would therefore be a type-mismatch (requiring an explicit cast or undefined behaviour). MISRA compliance requires proving there is no possible call-cycle; merely pointing out a speculative runtime assignment is not sufficient. In short: the code as written does not itself create a recursive call; an indirect recursion would only occur if the function pointer were intentionally (and incompatibly) set to point back to metal_dma_map (or to a function that leads back to it), which would itself violate other rules/assumptions. Therefore the report that this code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.2 is not correct in this context."
