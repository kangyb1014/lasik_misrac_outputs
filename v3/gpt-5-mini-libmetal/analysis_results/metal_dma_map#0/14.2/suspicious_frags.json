First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements or loop-like constructs in the provided function. The code contains: the function signature and local variable declaration, null and capability checks (if (!dev || !sg_in || !sg_out), if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map)), two conditional calls to atomic_thread_fence, a call through the dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map function pointer, and returns. None of these are for statements, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (requirements about the three clauses and loop counters of a for loop) cannot apply to any fragment in this code. Note: the called function via dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map is outside the provided code; any for loops it contains would need to be inspected in that target implementation, but those loops are not present in the supplied code and therefore are not included here for investigation."
