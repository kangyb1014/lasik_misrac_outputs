Therefore it should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const struct metal_sg *sg_in). Leaving it non-const violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (sg_out is an output and should remain non-const; dev cannot be safely made const here because it is forwarded to dev_dma_map which may modify it.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_map:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although metal_dma_map does not modify sg_in locally, sg_in is forwarded unchanged to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map, whose parameter type is (apparently) struct metal_sg * (non-const). You cannot safely change metal_dma_map's prototype to take const struct metal_sg *sg_in without also changing the bus callback and all callers; that makes const-qualification not \u201cpossible\u201d in the whole program context. MISRA Rule 8.13 requires const when feasible; in this case the non-const callback interface prevents applying const. Therefore flagging metal_dma_map as violating 8.13 is incorrect (unless the dev_dma_map prototype is changed to accept const, in which case both should be updated)."
