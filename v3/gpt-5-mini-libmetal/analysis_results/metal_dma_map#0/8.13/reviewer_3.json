For input-only scatter-gather entries (e.g. sg_in) the CPU buffer is not intended to be modified by the mapping operation, so the pointee should be const-qualified (const void *) or separate types should be used for input vs output.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA R8.13 encourages use of const where a pointer never modifies the pointee, but you must show that the pointee is in fact immutable for all uses. In the code shown, struct metal_sg::virt is part of a single SG type used for both input and output mappings (sg_in and sg_out) and the function forwards the entries to a bus-specific dev_dma_map callback. There is no evidence that the mapping operation never modifies the virt/len fields (or that the type is used only for read-only data). Making virt a const void * could be incorrect or too restrictive for callers that need writable buffers or that update the SG entries during mapping. Therefore the agent\u2019s claim (that this is a direct violation of R8.13) is not supported by the provided code/usage and is not correct. If you can show that sg_in entries are always treated as immutable across the whole API, then qualifying the appropriate parameter/field with const (or providing separate in/out types) would be the right action."
