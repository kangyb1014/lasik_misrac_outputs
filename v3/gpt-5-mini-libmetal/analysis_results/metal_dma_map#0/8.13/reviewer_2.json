True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function metal_dma_map takes 'struct metal_sg *sg_in' (an input scatter-gather list) and only reads/passes it to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map; metal_dma_map does not modify sg_in. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer used only for input should be const-qualified. In this fragment the input SG pointer is not const-qualified (and so should be declared as 'const struct metal_sg *sg_in' and the callee prototype updated accordingly). Therefore the code violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_map:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's reasoning (sg_in is only used as an input in this function and therefore should be declared const) is plausible, but incomplete. In metal_dma_map the sg_in pointer is forwarded to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map; we do not have the prototype for that callback. If that callback expects a non-const struct metal_sg * or may legally modify the scatter/gather entries, then metal_dma_map must use the same non-const type to match the API and avoid casting. MISRA Rule 8.13 is a \"should\" for const-correctness where possible, but it does not force changing signatures when doing so would be incompatible with the required API. Given the provided code alone there is insufficient evidence that sg_in could be safely changed to const (or that the callback does not modify it). Therefore the report is not provably correct. Recommendation: inspect the declaration of dev_dma_map (dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map) and all callers \u2014 if they never modify sg_in, change the API and this function to accept const struct metal_sg *sg_in; otherwise keep the current signature."
