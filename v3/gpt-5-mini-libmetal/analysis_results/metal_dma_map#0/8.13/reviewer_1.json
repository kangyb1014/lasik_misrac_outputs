  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not supported by the evidence. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to point to a const-qualified type when the pointer is used only to observe (not modify) the pointed-to object. The provided metal_dma_map function and the nearby type definitions do not show that the pointed-to objects are immutable or that the pointers are used only for observation. In particular:\n\n- irq_info is declared void *irq_info; but there is no use-site shown that demonstrates irq_info is never used to modify the pointed-to object. The comment \"IRQ ID\" suggests it may be used as an opaque handle or storage (possibly writable), so making it const may be incorrect. Without inspecting all uses of irq_info, you cannot claim a Rule 8.13 violation.\n- The metal_dma_map parameters (struct metal_device *dev, struct metal_sg *sg_in, struct metal_sg *sg_out) are non-const for good reason: the bus operation dev_dma_map is called and may legitimately modify device or scatter-gather structures (or internal state). Changing them to const would be incorrect unless the implementation guarantees no modifications and all callers adhere to that.\n\nTherefore there is insufficient evidence to say the code violates Rule 8.13. If you want to enforce Rule 8.13, audit all use-sites: if a pointer is never used to modify the pointee, add const; otherwise leave it non-const or justify the exception."
