True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe member is declared as a pointer to a non-const struct: \"struct metal_io_region *io;\". If the intended use of the IO region is read-only (which is typical for scatter/gather descriptors that just reference region metadata), the pointer should be declared const-qualified (\"const struct metal_io_region *io\"). As written, the pointer is not const-qualified, so it violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Example scenario: functions that only read region information (e.g. base address/size) could accept/read sg->io but the current declaration allows accidental modification of the region through sg->io; changing it to \"const struct metal_io_region *io\" would enforce read-only access.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_map:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence provided. Rule 8.13 concerns the declaration of pointers themselves (they should point to const-qualified types when possible). The code shown (metal_dma_map) does not dereference or modify sg->io; it merely passes the scatter/gather arrays through to a bus op. The additional struct definitions show metal_sg.io is declared as \"struct metal_io_region *io;\" but no usage is shown that proves the pointee is never modified. Without reviewing the rest of the codebase you cannot determine whether the pointer could safely be declared \"const struct metal_io_region *io\". Therefore the claim that metal_dma_map (and the shown declaration) violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is not provably correct from the supplied snippets.\n\nIf, in the full codebase, the metal_io_region data are never modified after device setup and all users only read via sg->io, then changing the member to \"const struct metal_io_region *io\" would be appropriate and would satisfy Rule 8.13. Conversely, if any code writes through this pointer (or needs to), then the current non-const declaration is required and no violation exists. To confirm a true MISRA violation, examine all uses of metal_sg.io and the API contract to see whether it could be const-qualified; if it can, the code should be changed or a documented deviation provided."
