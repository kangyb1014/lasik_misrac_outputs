  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: needed to resolve dev->bus and any string/char* members of the device that might be compared by downstream code.\n- struct metal_bus: needed to resolve the bus pointer and access to its ops structure.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (member: dev_dma_map): required to see the prototype/type of the dev_dma_map callback (so we know its parameters and whether it can receive/compare strings).\n- implementations of dev_dma_map (all functions assigned to metal_bus_ops->dev_dma_map): the target function delegates to this callback; any memcmp usage that violates the MISRA rule would occur in these implementations, so they must be inspected.\n- struct metal_sg: the scatter/gather descriptors passed into dev_dma_map could carry pointers/lengths; knowing their layout is necessary to determine if memcmp is being used on null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp (the C library function) and any local wrappers/macros that call or wrap memcmp: to detect direct uses of memcmp and determine whether the arguments are null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation).\n- transitive callees of dev_dma_map (any functions called by those implementations): memcmp may be called indirectly; all transitive callees must be examined to ensure no memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nIn short: because metal_dma_map itself does not call memcmp, the analysis must inspect the callback (dev_dma_map), its implementations and their callees, and the relevant data types (metal_device, metal_bus, metal_sg) and memcmp usages to decide whether any memcmp is comparing null-terminated strings."
