  "explanation": "I inspected the function metal_dma_map and the related type and macro definitions provided. I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. In particular:\n- There are no occurrences of compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC extension), statement-expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions (GCC extension).\n- There is no inline assembly, no use of pragmas that are compiler-specific, and no use of vendor-specific extensions documented as such (e.g., Microsoft __forceinline, GCC\u2019s __extension__, etc.).\n- The atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_release / memory_order_acq_rel identifiers are standard C11 <stdatomic.h> features, not compiler extensions.\n- Use of fixed-width integer types (uint32_t), function pointers in structs, pointer types, and errno-like macros (-EINVAL, -ENODEV) are standard C/C/POSIX usage, not compiler extensions.\n- Struct definitions and function prototypes use standard C syntax only; there are no flexible array members, variable-length arrays, or other implementation-defined constructs present here that would be considered an explicit compiler extension in common compiler documentation.\n\nBased on the provided code fragments, there are no language extensions to report for investigation."
