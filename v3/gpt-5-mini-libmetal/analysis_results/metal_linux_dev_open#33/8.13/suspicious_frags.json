  "explanation": "The above fragments involve pointers that are only read in this function (ldrv and lbus, and accesses to ldrv->sdrv and the driver callbacks). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 these should be checked to see if they can be declared to point to const-qualified types. Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule: dev_name is already const (const char *dev_name); ldev is written to (memset, strncpy, field assignments) so it cannot be a pointer-to-const; bus is modified (metal_list_add_tail(&bus->devices,...)) so it cannot be const; the out parameter struct metal_device **device is assigned/modified and thus must be non-const; malloc/free usage and integer variables do not pertain to pointer-to-const qualification. Therefore only the listed pointer-related fragments require further investigation."
