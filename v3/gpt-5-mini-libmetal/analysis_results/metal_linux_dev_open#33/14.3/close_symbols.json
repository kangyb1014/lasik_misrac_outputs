  "explanation": "for_each_linux_driver (macro/iterator): The loop controlling expression is the primary candidate for an invariant. You must see the macro expansion and how it obtains/advances the driver iterator (e.g. which field of linux_bus it reads) to determine whether the loop condition can be a compile-time or run-time invariant (empty list, infinite loop, or always-false).\n\nstruct linux_bus (definition): The iterator macro will reference fields inside linux_bus (driver list/head). Knowing the bus layout determines whether the loop control depends on mutable state or a constant expression.\n\nstruct linux_driver (definition: includes sdrv, dev_open, dev_close): The test if (!ldrv->sdrv || !ldrv->dev_open) is a controlling expression that depends on members of linux_driver. You need the struct layout and types to judge whether those members are constant/invariant for the loop or can vary between iterations or runs.\n\nprototype/type of linux_driver::dev_open: dev_open is invoked and its presence is tested in a controlling expression. Its prototype (parameters, return convention) is needed to reason whether calls to dev_open could change local variables used in controlling expressions (e.g. could it set or clear pointers accessible to the caller) and whether its return value makes subsequent tests invariant.\n\nprototype/type of linux_driver::dev_close: dev_close is called when dev_open fails. To determine if the inner check if (!ldev) can ever become true during iteration you must know whether dev_close could modify the caller's ldev (it cannot change the caller's local pointer unless prototype permits pointer-to-pointer). The prototype proves whether dev_close can make the controlling tests invariant (or create side-effects that do so).\n\nstruct linux_device (definition): ldev's type and member layout are used in the function and relevant when reasoning about whether operations on the device (via dev_open/dev_close) could alter the pointer value or make pointer tests invariant. Also useful to confirm that freeing the pointed object would not change the pointer value (so the test if (!ldev) remains invariant)."
