Therefore the subsequent test and allocation inside the loop: if (!ldev) ldev = malloc(...); if (!ldev) return -ENOMEM; can never be reached in the shown flow \u2014 the inner check/allocation is redundant dead code. Removing those two lines would not change program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown function ldev is allocated immediately before the loop (ldev = malloc(...); if (!ldev) return -ENOMEM;) and nowhere in the snippet is ldev ever set to NULL before the inner test. Therefore the inner branch\n    if (!ldev) ldev = malloc(...);\n    if (!ldev) return -ENOMEM;\ncan never evaluate to true and removing those lines would not change the observable behaviour \u2014 they are redundant and thus constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The only caveat would be if external code reachable from the loop somehow set the local ldev variable to NULL before the check, which is not possible in C without explicitly assigning it; freeing the memory via a driver routine would yield a dangling pointer, not a NULL, so it would not make the inner allocation necessary.)"
