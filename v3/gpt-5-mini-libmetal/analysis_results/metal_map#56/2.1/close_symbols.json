  "explanation": "To decide whether any branch in metal_map is statically unreachable we must know the values, semantics and return behavior of all external symbols that affect control flow and conditional checks: \n\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: determine prot value used by mmap; while they don't affect branching here, include to be complete when reasoning about MAP/Mmap return behavior that could influence later code paths.  \n- MAP_SHARED: used in flags |= MAP_SHARED; if this macro were 0 or had unusual semantics it could affect whether flags changes and thus whether later code is meaningful.  \n- MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: assigned when fd < 0; need their definitions to reason whether the fd<0 branch is meaningful and whether flags manipulation could make other branches constant.  \n- MAP_FAILED: sentinel value compared against mmap return; its definition (typically (void *)-1) is required to determine whether the mmap failure test can ever be optimized away or is reachable.  \n- mmap: its prototype and runtime semantics (return value on success/failure and possible side effects) are required to know whether the mmap(...) call can fail and thus whether the subsequent if (mem == MAP_FAILED) branch is reachable.  \n- flock, LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN: flock call and lock constants are used in the expand path; need flock behavior (return values and errno setting) to determine whether the expand branch can fail early or always succeed; also required to reason about whether flock-related code is reachable.  \n- fstat and struct stat (stat.st_size): fstat populates stat.st_size which is used to decide whether ftruncate is called; both the presence/type of struct stat and fstat semantics are required to evaluate reachability of the ftruncate branch.  \n- ftruncate: its return behavior determines whether the code returns early from metal_map inside the expand-handling sequence (and whether those return statements are reachable).  \n- errno: used to convert failing system calls into negative error codes and returned values; must know that errno is a modifiable global and how it is set by syscall wrappers to determine the values assigned to error and whether the return -errno can ever be compiled into a constant.  \n- off_t, size_t, NULL: types and NULL macro are required to ensure type-based reachability considerations (e.g., whether offset+size overflows off_t, or whether NULL could equal MAP_FAILED in some weird platform) are accounted for.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow a precise determination of whether any conditional (fd < 0, else if (expand), checks on flock/fstat/ftruncate results, and the mmap failure test) can be proved always true or always false (i.e. statically unreachable) under platform/macro definitions. Without them one cannot conclude that any branch is unreachable for purposes of the MISRA rule."
