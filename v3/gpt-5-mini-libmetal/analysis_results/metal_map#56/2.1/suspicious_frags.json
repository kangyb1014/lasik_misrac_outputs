  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected. The function's control flow has three mutually exclusive, reachable paths: (1) fd < 0 branch (sets fd = -1 and flags to MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS) then proceeds to mmap; (2) fd >= 0 and expand true branch (performs flock, fstat, ftruncate, unlock and may return on error); (3) fd >= 0 and expand false branch (skips the expand block and proceeds to mmap). There are no statements placed after an unconditional return, no cases of code behind constant-false conditions, and no constructs that can never be reached at runtime given the function parameters. Notes that some assignments are overwritten (Flags OR then later assigned for fd < 0) or that error is only referenced inside the expand branch (so it is not used uninitialized) \u2014 these are not unreachable-code issues and therefore do not require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
