  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to decide const-qualification for pointer parameters/returns:\n\n- mmap: The function returns the pointer stored in *result via mmap. You must inspect mmap's prototype (returns void *) and semantics to know whether the pointed-to memory is intended to be mutable or immutable and therefore whether the public pointer type should be const-qualified.\n\n- MAP_FAILED: Used to detect mmap failure; relevant to the control flow and to confirm that a valid mapping (non-const) is returned on success.\n\n- PROT_READ / PROT_WRITE: These protection flags determine whether the mapping is writable (PROT_WRITE present). If the mapping is writable, the pointer returned should not be to const-qualified data. These macros are therefore essential to determine whether const qualification is appropriate.\n\n- MAP_SHARED / MAP_PRIVATE / MAP_ANONYMOUS: These mapping flags can affect intended usage semantics (shared vs private anonymous mappings). Callers may have different expectations about mutability depending on these flags; include them to understand whether the API intends to return writable memory (affecting const qualification).\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open: One of the callers. You must inspect its prototype and how it passes the result pointer and how it subsequently uses the mapped memory (reads vs writes). That usage informs whether metal_map's out-parameter should point to const data or mutable data.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: The other caller. As with metal_uio_dev_open, examine how it passes the result argument and how it uses the mapping (including any writes). Also inspect whether it subsequently calls metal_unmap with the obtained pointer. Caller usage determines whether const qualification is possible.\n\n- metal_unmap: Caller/related function that consumes mappings. Its parameter types and usage (does it accept a void * or const void *) help establish whether mappings returned by metal_map are treated as mutable or const by the API as a whole.\n\nIn short: to decide if 'void **result' (and related pointer types) should point to const-qualified data you need (1) the mmap semantics/protection flags (PROT_WRITE etc.) to know if mapped memory is writable and (2) the caller signatures and call-sites (metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_try_map, metal_unmap) to see how the returned pointer is passed around and whether callers ever mutate the pointee. These symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether const-qualification is possible without breaking intended use."
