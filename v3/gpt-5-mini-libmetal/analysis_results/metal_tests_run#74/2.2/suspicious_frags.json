  "explanation": "All other code fragments are standard control-flow, variable usage or error-handling operations that are obviously executed and whose removal would change program behaviour: the loop over test_cases (metal_list_for_each) drives test execution; test_case = metal_container_of(...) and error = test_case->test() invoke the tests and capture results; the initial declarations of test_case, node, error, and errors are used later; the early return on metal_init failure affects control flow; the metal_log(\"running [...]\") call performs observable logging (and can affect timing); updating errors and the final return errors deliver the aggregated outcome. These operations are therefore not candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 and do not need further investigation."
