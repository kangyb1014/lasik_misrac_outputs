  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are evidently invariant and requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All control statements in the provided function depend on runtime values:\n\n- if (irq < irq_cntr->irq_base || irq >= irq_cntr->irq_base + irq_cntr->irq_num)\n  - The expression depends on the parameter irq and on fields of the irq_cntr pointer, which are runtime values; it is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- if (state == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE)\n  - The expression depends on the state parameter passed at runtime; it is not invariant.\n\n- if (ret < 0)\n  - ret is assigned from the function call metal_linux_irq_notify(); its value is determined at runtime, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\nThere are no loops in this function (no while/for/do-while) that would create a potential invariant controlling expression, and none of the above conditionals are constant expressions or compile-time invariants. Therefore no code fragments need to be flagged for investigation under Rule 14.3."
