Because the pointer is never used to modify the pointed-to object, it should be declared 'const void *arg'.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The agent's claim hinges on the struct member void *arg being never used to modify the pointee and therefore being convertible to const void *. The target function metal_linux_irq_set_enable does not touch arg, but the snippet does not prove arg is never used elsewhere or that controller callback prototypes do not expect a non-const pointer. MISRA Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified only when it is possible to do so; whether that is possible must be determined by the entire API and all uses of the member. Here arg is an opaque context passed into controller callbacks (and the comment says \"Argument to pass to interrupt controller function\"), so the API may intentionally allow mutable contexts. Without evidence that all users and callback prototypes treat the pointee as immutable, you cannot conclude there is a violation. To establish a true MISRA 8.13 violation you would need to show that arg is never used to modify the pointee anywhere and that all callbacks accept (or could accept) a pointer-to-const. Because that proof is not present, the reported violation is not demonstrated."
