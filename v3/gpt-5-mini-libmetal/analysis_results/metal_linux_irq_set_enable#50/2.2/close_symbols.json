  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- linux_irq_cntr\n  Required to know the actual global controller instance used in the offset calculation (linux_irq_cntr.irq_base). If linux_irq_cntr is invalid/unused or identical to irq_cntr, the offset calculation (and thus the bit operations) might be dead.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (members: irq_base, irq_num)\n  Needed to determine the validity/range check semantics (irq_base, irq_num), possible integer overflow/underflow in the range test and offset computation, and whether those members are compile-time constants or modifiable at runtime (affects reachability of branches).\n\n- irqs_enabled\n  The bitmap being modified. To decide if the set/clear operations are dead you must know whether this storage is observed elsewhere (volatile/atomic qualifiers, placement, or never-read). If writes to this bitmap have no observable effect elsewhere then those operations are dead.\n\n- irq_lock\n  The mutex object used for synchronization. If the lock operations are no-ops (e.g. single-threaded build) then acquire/release may be dead; conversely if they provide essential synchronization then they are not dead. Knowledge of the lock object/type is required.\n\n- metal_bitmap_set_bit\n  Implementation is needed to know whether it actually mutates irqs_enabled or is a stub/no-op in some configurations; also to check for side effects (returns, logging) that would make the call non-dead.\n\n- metal_bitmap_clear_bit\n  Same reasons as metal_bitmap_set_bit: must know if it performs observable work.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire\n  Implementation (and build-time configuration) is needed to determine whether calling it has observable effects (blocking, scheduler interaction) or is a no-op; a no-op would affect whether those calls are dead or not.\n\n- metal_mutex_release\n  Same as metal_mutex_acquire: must know if release does observable work.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_notify\n  The notification call may be the only observable side effect of changing the bitmap. If notify is a no-op or always returns success without side effects, the notify+log paths could be dead. Its implementation and side effects are essential.\n\n- metal_log\n  The logging call used for invalid irq and notify failure paths. If metal_log is compiled out/disabled or is a side-effect-free stub, the log calls could be dead; conversely, if it writes to I/O they are observable.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR\n  The logging severity/macro may be configuration-dependent (compiles out certain levels). Needed to know whether those log calls are present in the build.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE\n  Macro/value used in the comparison of state. If its value makes the condition always true/false for all callers or configurations, one of the two bitmap operations would be dead.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_handling (reader of irqs_enabled)\n  Any code that reads irqs_enabled (e.g. the IRQ handling thread) makes the set/clear operations observable. You must examine those readers to decide if modifying irqs_enabled affects program behaviour (thus not dead).\n\n- call sites / registration points that take &metal_linux_irq_set_enable (function-pointer assignments)\n  The function may be unreachable (dead) if it is never referenced/registered. To determine whether the function itself or its internal operations are dead you must locate where (if anywhere) it is assigned to IRQ controller ops or invoked; absence of callers would make the whole function dead code.\n\nSummary: determining whether operations in metal_linux_irq_set_enable are dead requires the definitions and build-time configuration of the globals it touches (linux_irq_cntr, irqs_enabled, irq_lock), the implementations/configuration of called functions (bitmap ops, mutex ops, notify, log), the macro values used in comparisons, and the presence of any readers or call-sites that make the writes and notify observable. Without these symbols you cannot conclude whether the instructions are removable without changing program behaviour."
