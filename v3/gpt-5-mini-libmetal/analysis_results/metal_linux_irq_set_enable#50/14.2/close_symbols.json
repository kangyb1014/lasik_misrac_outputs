Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "To decide if metal_linux_irq_set_enable (or any function it invokes) violates the MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' rule we must examine any for\u2011loops in the target and in the called code and any objects those loops read or modify. The following symbols are therefore required: \n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: to know the types and semantics of irq_base and irq_num (are they modifiable, their integer types) so we can determine whether they can act as loop counters or be modified in loop bodies. \n- linux_irq_cntr: target uses linux_irq_cntr. Its definition/value could be referenced by loops in callees; we must know whether it is modified elsewhere or used as a loop counter. \n- irqs_enabled: the bitmap object modified here via bitmap_set/clear. If any for loop in called code iterates over or uses this object in its loop condition, MISRA rules about objects modified in the loop body apply. We must know its type and visibility. \n- irq_lock: the mutex object acquired/released here. Mutex implementation or functions using it may contain loops or blocking waits; we must inspect those to ensure any for loops they contain are well\u2011formed and do not rely on objects modified in loop bodies. \n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: value/definition used in the conditional; necessary to check any compile\u2011time constructs or macros that may expand into loops. \n- metal_bitmap_set_bit / metal_bitmap_clear_bit: implementations must be inspected for any for loops they contain (loop counters, loop conditions, side effects) and for use of objects that target modifies (irqs_enabled). The body of any for loop in these functions may call other functions or modify external objects. \n- metal_mutex_acquire / metal_mutex_release: implementations may contain loops (spinning, waits). Those loops must be examined for well\u2011formedness and for interaction with objects modified in this function. \n- metal_linux_irq_notify: implementation must be checked for for\u2011loops and for use/modification of objects that interact with this function (e.g., irqs_enabled, linux_irq_cntr). The rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside a loop as part of the loop body, so any loops here (or loops here that call back) are relevant. \n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_ERROR: logging routines/macros can expand to helper functions or macros that might contain loops or side effects; include them to be safe when inspecting for loops introduced via logging macros. \n\nExamining the source/definitions of these symbols lets the analyzer find any for loops, determine their loop counters and conditions, and check whether the loop conditions or increment expressions improperly depend on or are modified by objects that are changed in the loop body (including via called functions), as required by the MISRA rule."
