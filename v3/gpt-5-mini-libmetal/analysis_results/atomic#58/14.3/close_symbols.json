  "explanation": "- metal_run: atomic() uses the return value of metal_run in the controlling expression if (!error). You must know metal_run's semantics (does it ever return a constant/compile-time-invariant value, or under what conditions it changes) and whether it actually runs atomic_thread instances that modify shared state. - atomic_thread: threads started by metal_run execute atomic_thread; to determine whether the computed \"value\" can change (so that the controlling expression if (value) is not invariant) you must know what atomic_thread does (whether it updates the counter or atomic_test_count). - atomic_load: value is obtained by calling atomic_load(&counter). The semantics of atomic_load (what it can return given concurrent updates, memory-order effects, and whether it can be treated as non-volatile for invariance analysis) is required to decide if the loaded value is invariant. - atomic_test_count: the expression value -= atomic_test_count * threads uses this symbol; if atomic_test_count is a compile-time constant or never changed by threads, the product could be invariant. You must know whether this symbol is mutable and possibly updated by atomic_thread (or others). - atomic_int and ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: these define the type and initialisation of counter (atomic_int counter = ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(0)). You need their definitions to know the initial state of counter and whether the counter variable has atomic semantics that allow concurrent modification (hence non-invariant reads)."
