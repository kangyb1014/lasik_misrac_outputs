  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function 'atomic' violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be sure (a) that 'atomic' itself has no parameters to be modified, and (b) that nothing called or expanded in the body is actually a macro or inline construct that would modify a parameter of 'atomic' or otherwise hide parameter modification through macro expansion. The listed symbols are required for those checks:\n\n- metal_run (declaration and definition): atomic calls metal_run; we need the prototype/definition to verify whether metal_run is a normal function (so its parameter modifications would be confined to metal_run) or a macro/inline that could expand into code that changes/assigns something in the caller scope (which might affect whether 'atomic' modifies a parameter). Also inspect metal_run's own source to see whether it assigns to its parameters (a violation in metal_run itself) or mutates pointers passed by callers in a way that could be misinterpreted.\n\n- atomic_thread (declaration/definition): this function pointer is passed into metal_run. We need its signature and implementation to confirm it is a standalone function (and to check whether it modifies its own parameters). If atomic_thread is a macro or inline that could expand into code in the caller, that could affect the MISRA analysis of 'atomic'.\n\n- metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads (declaration/definition): transitive callees of metal_run. If metal_run is a wrapper or macro that forwards to these, their definitions may be needed to fully understand whether any parameter-modifying code is introduced via metal_run call paths or macro expansions.\n\n- atomic_load (declaration/definition): atomic calls atomic_load(&counter). We need the prototype/definition to confirm it is a normal function (or an inline/macro) and to ensure no macro expansion modifies parameters in caller scope. Also to confirm that atomic_load's parameter behavior conforms to the rule (pointer parameter object may be modified but the pointer itself must not be reassigned inside atomic_load).\n\n- atomic_int and ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: the type and initializer are used to define 'counter'. The analyzer must see whether these are macros or typedefs that expand into something affecting parameters or introduce hidden parameters/side-effects.\n\n- atomic_test_count (declaration/definition): used in the arithmetic that follows atomic_load; include to ensure no macro redefinition or side-effecting macro that could mask parameter modification.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_DEBUG: logging call used when mismatch detected. Include to verify it is not a macro that expands into code affecting parameters of 'atomic' (rare but possible in embedded codebases).\n\n- EINVAL: included since it is returned as an error; include to complete understanding of control flow and any macros that might interfere with analysis.\n\nIn short: retrieve the function prototypes/definitions and related macros/types for all identifiers used in atomic and the transitive callees of metal_run so the next analysis can confirm (1) atomic truly has no parameters to be modified and (2) no called function or macro expands into code that would constitute modifying a function parameter in the context of 'atomic'."
