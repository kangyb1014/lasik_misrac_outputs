  "explanation": "I inspected the provided functions (atomic and metal_run). Neither function has parameters that are assigned to, incremented, decremented, or otherwise modified within the function body. atomic() has no parameters. metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg) uses its parameters only as inputs: threads is used to size a VLA (pthread_t tids[threads]) and is not assigned to; child and arg are forwarded to metal_run_noblock without being modified; the cast (void *)tids only converts the array address for passing to metal_finish_threads and does not modify any parameter. No code fragment in the supplied code performs an assignment to a function parameter or rebinds a pointer parameter, so there are no instances that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
