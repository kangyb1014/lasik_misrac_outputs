  "explanation": "Include these symbols to decide whether any executed operations in atomic() are dead code:\n\n- metal_run: atomic() calls metal_run and its return determines whether the subsequent check/log/error path is executed. Need metal_run implementation/semantics to know when atomic() continues and whether removal of later code would change behavior.\n- metal_run_noblock / metal_finish_threads: metal_run calls these; their behavior (e.g. thread creation, synchronization, join/cleanup) can produce side effects that affect the counter or error handling. Understanding them is required to see if the later load/test/log/error are necessary.\n- atomic_thread: passed to metal_run as the thread entry; its behavior (does it increment the counter, modify atomic_test_count, have other side effects?) determines whether the counter value and the subtraction produce any meaningful effect \u2014 crucial to decide if the test and logging are dead.\n- atomic_test_count: global used in the subtraction (value -= atomic_test_count * threads). Its value and use pattern (constant, modified by threads, or zero) determine whether the subtraction and the subsequent conditional ever change behavior.\n- atomic_int / ATOMIC_VAR_INIT / atomic_load: these define the atomic counter type, its initialization and read semantics. Knowing whether atomic_load has side effects or ordering guarantees is needed to judge whether the load and comparison are necessary or removable without changing behavior.\n- metal_log / METAL_LOG_DEBUG: logging may be considered a side effect. To determine if the logging call (and the surrounding conditional) is dead code, you must know if metal_log performs observable actions (I/O, state changes) and how METAL_LOG_DEBUG controls that behavior.\n- EINVAL: used to set error when mismatch detected. To decide whether assigning error = -EINVAL (and thus changing atomic() return) is meaningful, the actual error code and its use by callers must be known (include the macro to trace semantics).\n\nProviding these symbols (and then inspecting their implementations/globals) lets the analyzer determine if removing the load/test/log/error sequence would alter observable program behavior (i.e. whether it is dead code under MISRA's definition)."
