  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in atomic() should be const-qualified we must inspect the declarations/definitions that determine pointer parameter types and whether the pointed-to objects are mutated:\n\n- metal_run: its prototype (especially the type of the 3rd parameter) is needed to know whether the function expects a void * or a const void * (i.e. whether passing &counter could/should be const-qualified). Also the type of the 2nd parameter (thread function pointer type) is needed to match atomic_thread.\n\n- atomic_thread: the thread function\u2019s prototype and implementation are required to determine whether it mutates the object passed via its argument. If atomic_thread modifies the counter via its argument then the pointer cannot be const; if it only reads it, a const-qualified pointer might be appropriate.\n\n- atomic_load: the declaration is required to see what qualification the function expects for the pointer argument (e.g. const atomic_int * or atomic_int *). This determines whether the call atomic_load(&counter) conforms to a const requirement or not.\n\n- atomic_int: the typedef (or _Atomic definition) is needed to understand the exact type being pointed to and how atomic_load/other atomic APIs expect qualifiers to be applied (e.g. const _Atomic int * vs _Atomic const int * semantics).\n\n- ATOMIC_VAR_INIT: the macro/initializer declaration helps confirm the declared type and initialization semantics of counter; this can influence whether counter should be an object treated as mutable by threads or could be considered immutable for some uses.\n\n- metal_log: its prototype (format string parameter type) is needed because a string literal is passed; MISRA expects format strings to be const char * when possible. If metal_log is declared to take a non-const char * that would be relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary type and mutability information to determine whether any pointer in atomic() should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
