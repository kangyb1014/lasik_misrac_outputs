  "explanation": "I selected the above fragments because they involve pointer parameters or argument passing where the pointed-to type is not const-qualified at the API boundary and should be reviewed for possible const qualification per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other pointer usages in the provided code were not flagged because they legitimately require a mutable (non-const) pointee or do not involve a pointer-to-data that could be const-qualified:\n\n- atomic_thread(void *arg) and the local assignment atomic_int *c = arg are not suspicious: atomic_thread modifies the object via atomic_fetch_add(c, 1), so the pointee must be mutable and cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- The &counter argument in the atomic() function is used to supply a mutable atomic_int to threads; that object is intentionally modified by the thread function, so the pointee cannot be const.\n\n- The metal_log usage passes a format string literal; string literals are effectively const char[], and the macro/log handler signatures are not provided, but typical log handlers accept const char*. There is no evidence here that a pointer-to-data that is not modified could be const-qualified better than it currently is.\n\n- Conversions between void * and specific pointer types (e.g., atomic_int *) are required by the threading API callback convention; those conversions themselves are acceptable provided the actual mutation semantics are needed (as in atomic_thread).\n\nReview the highlighted fragments to determine whether the API and internal functions should use const-qualified pointer types (for example, changing metal_run's parameter from void *arg to const void *arg) or whether their current non-const signatures are justified by downstream mutation (e.g., by thread functions)."
