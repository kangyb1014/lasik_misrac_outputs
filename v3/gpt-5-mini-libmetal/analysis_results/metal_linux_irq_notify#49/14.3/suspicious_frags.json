  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found. The only controlling construct is the if statement: if (ret < 0) { ... } \u2014 ret is assigned immediately beforehand from the call to write(irq_notify_fd, &val, sizeof(val)) and therefore is a runtime value, not an invariant compile-time constant. There are no loops (while, do-while, for) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions, and none of the MISRA-allowed exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the specific do-while constant-false case) apply. Consequently, no code fragments require investigation under Rule 14.3."
