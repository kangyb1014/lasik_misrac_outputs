  "explanation": "The write(irq_notify_fd, &val, sizeof(val)) call is a POSIX I/O call, not one of the <string.h> functions listed by Rule 21.17, and it writes a fixed-size integer using its address and sizeof, so it does not present a string.h bounds concern. The local variable declarations (uint64_t val, int ret) and the irq_notify_fd declaration are not uses of standard string handling functions. The only fragments that could involve the string.h API are the logging macro and its use because they invoke metal_fmt(fmt) and the log_handler; those functions (not shown) may call string.h routines and therefore must be inspected. No other occurrences of memcpy/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/memset/memmove/memcmp/strlen/strspn are present in the provided code, so nothing else needs investigation for Rule 21.17."
