  "explanation": "Other parts of the provided code do not introduce pointers that are candidates for const-qualification in the shown context: irq_notify_fd is an integer (not a pointer), the return statement contains no pointer use, and the metal_log macro expansion and its surrounding usage do not show any pointer declarations or pointer arguments in this snippet that would be subject to Rule 8.13 without additional context (the macro and log handler signature are not provided). Therefore they do not need investigation for this rule based on the available code."
