  "explanation": "All other code in the provided snippets uses standard C or standard library/POSIX interfaces: the function signature, uint64_t usage, assignment and call to write(), the static variable declaration, and use of the identifier __func__ are not compiler language extensions. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2. The only places that may employ compiler-specific extensions are the macro definition and its invocation shown above; no other fragments in the supplied code use constructs that are known compiler language extensions."
