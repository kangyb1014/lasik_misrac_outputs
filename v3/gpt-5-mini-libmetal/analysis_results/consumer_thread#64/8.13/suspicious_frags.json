  "explanation": "The other pointer usages in the function (e.g. &lock, &nempty_condv, &nfull_condv passed to metal_mutex_acquire/metal_mutex_release/metal_condition_wait/metal_condition_signal) refer to synchronization objects that are expected to be modified by those APIs (lock/unlock, wait/signal). Such parameters therefore cannot sensibly be const-qualified and need not be investigated for Rule 8.13. Also, the thread entry/return type must match the platform/thread API (commonly void *(*)(void *)), so the returned NULL and the function return type should be treated in light of that API; only the parameter's pointed-to constness (and its unused cast) warrant inspection under Rule 8.13."
