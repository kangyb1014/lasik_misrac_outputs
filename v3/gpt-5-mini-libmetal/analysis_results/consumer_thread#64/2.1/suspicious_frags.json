  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are necessarily unreachable (i.e., statically or logically impossible to reach) in the provided code. Reasoning by function:\n\n- consumer_thread / producer_thread: Each thread acquires the mutex, enters a conditional while loop that calls metal_condition_wait only while the condition holds, performs the counter update, signals the other condition variable, releases the mutex, and returns. None of these statements are after an unconditional infinite loop or unconditional return that would make following code unreachable. The while loops are conditional and may block at runtime, but blocking is not the same as compile-time unreachable code.\n\n- metal_condition_wait: All branches are reachable depending on runtime conditions. The early return on invalid parameters or if the mutex is not acquired (return -EINVAL) is reachable if callers pass invalid arguments or misuse the API. The atomic_compare_exchange_strong call can both succeed and fail; if it fails it updates tmpmptr, and the subsequent inner if (tmpmptr != mptr) may be true (causing return -EINVAL) or false (allowing execution to continue). The code that releases the mutex, calls futex wait, and reacquires the mutex is executed on the normal wait path and is therefore reachable. The final return 0 is reachable on the normal successful path.\n\nNo statements in the supplied fragments are syntactically unreachable (e.g., code after an unconditional goto/return/break that can never be executed), nor are there branches that are provably impossible given the visible code. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the supplied code."
