  "explanation": "To determine if consumer_thread calls itself (directly or indirectly) we must examine every function it calls and those functions' callees (the reachable call graph). Each listed symbol is required because:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: Called directly by consumer_thread. We must inspect its body to see if it (directly or indirectly) invokes consumer_thread.\n\n- metal_condition_wait: Called directly by consumer_thread. It itself calls other functions (metal_mutex_is_acquired, metal_mutex_release, metal_mutex_acquire); we must examine it to see if it (or any function it calls) can call back into consumer_thread.\n\n- metal_condition_signal: Called directly by consumer_thread. We must inspect it to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call consumer_thread.\n\n- metal_mutex_release: Called directly by consumer_thread and indirectly via metal_condition_wait. We must inspect its implementation for any call paths that might lead back to consumer_thread.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: Called by metal_condition_wait. Include it because any callee of a callee could provide an indirect path back to consumer_thread.\n\nNo other symbols are necessary because the static call graph shows these are the only functions reachable from consumer_thread; none of them have further callees (beyond those listed) that would expand the reachable set. Examining the bodies of these symbols is sufficient to determine whether any call chain from consumer_thread can lead back to consumer_thread (thereby violating the MISRA recursion rule)."
