  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code. consumer_thread calls metal_condition_wait and metal_condition_signal, neither of which (based on the provided metal_condition_wait implementation) calls consumer_thread back. A violation would occur only if metal_condition_signal (or some function it calls) directly or indirectly invoked consumer_thread (for example if metal_condition_signal called a helper which eventually re-entered consumer_thread), but there is no evidence of such a call chain in the provided code."
