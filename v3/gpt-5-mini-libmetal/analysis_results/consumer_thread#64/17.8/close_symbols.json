  "explanation": "To determine whether consumer_thread violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" you must not only inspect the function body but also any callees or macros that could lexically or semantically modify the parameter identifier 'arg' (or expand into code that assigns to it). Explanations per symbol:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (definition or macro): the call could be a macro that expands using the identifier 'arg' or contains code that assigns to local identifiers; the actual definition is required to rule out any lexical modification of the parameter.\n\n- metal_condition_wait (definition or macro): this callee is the most likely place for a macro/inline expansion that could reference or assign to 'arg' (and it also calls other mutex helpers). Its body or macro form must be checked to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable.\n\n- metal_condition_signal (definition or macro): although this call does not take 'arg', if it is macro-expanded it could still reference/modify identifiers in the caller scope; verify its definition.\n\n- metal_mutex_release (definition or macro): same rationale as metal_mutex_acquire; needed to exclude any macro or inline code that touches the 'arg' identifier.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired (definition or macro): called by metal_condition_wait (per call graph); include its definition because it could be part of an expansion chain that affects the caller's tokens.\n\n- lock, nempty_condv, nfull_condv, counter (declarations/definitions): these identifiers appear in the function; their declarations show whether they are plain variables or macros/inline constructs. If any are macros that expand into code using 'arg' or performing assignments at the call site, that could imply modification of the parameter name. Also, confirming they are ordinary globals clarifies that the function only modifies globals/pointees (allowed) and not the parameter variable itself.\n\n- Relevant preprocessor macros from included headers (any macro named 'arg' or macros that expand to code used in this function): because macro expansion happens before compilation, a macro named 'arg' or macros that expand the calls in this function could rewrite or introduce assignments to the token 'arg'. You must examine headers/preprocessor definitions in scope to guarantee the parameter token is not altered by macros.\n\nCollecting the above symbol definitions (source or header-level macros) allows a sound determination whether the token 'arg' is ever assigned to or otherwise modified by expansions or callees; if none of these definitions assign to the parameter identifier, the function complies with the MISRA requirement (the cast (void)arg; does not modify the parameter)."
