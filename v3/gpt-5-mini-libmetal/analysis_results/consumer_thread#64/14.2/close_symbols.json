The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "MISRA rule requires inspecting every for-statement in the target function and in any functions whose behaviour is part of the for-loop body. Although consumer_thread itself has no for loop, each callee (and transitive callee) must be inspected for for-loops and for usage of loop counters/control flags or objects that could be modified inside such loops. Explanations per symbol:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: implementation/prototype is required because it is directly called by consumer_thread; it may contain for-loops or modify objects that could be used as loop counters/control flags.\n- metal_condition_wait: required because consumer_thread calls it and its behaviour is part of the caller's execution; it is likely to contain waiting loops and may use/modify objects relevant to for-loop well-formedness.\n- metal_condition_signal: required to check whether it contains for-loops or modifies objects that could be used as loop counters or loop-control flags in any enclosing for loop.\n- metal_mutex_release: required because it is called by consumer_thread (and by condition wait); its implementation could contain for-loops or side-effects relevant to loop analysis.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: transitive callee of metal_condition_wait; include its definition because it may be used inside loops in condition wait or elsewhere and thus affects validity of for-loop clauses.\n- lock: the mutex object passed to the mutex functions; its type and semantics may influence whether functions acquire/release or modify other objects used in loops. Knowledge of this symbol is needed to understand side-effects of called functions.\n- nempty_condv: the condition-variable object waited on by consumer_thread; include its declaration/type because condition wait/signal implementations operate on it and may contain loops that use or modify shared objects.\n- nfull_condv: the condition-variable object signalled by consumer_thread; include its declaration/type for the same reasons as nempty_condv.\n- counter: the global/shared variable read/decremented by consumer_thread; include its declaration/type to determine if it could serve as a loop counter elsewhere or be used in for-loop clauses and whether it is modified in loop bodies (rule forbids using objects modified in the loop body in the loop second/third clauses).\n- metal_mutex_t: the mutex type definition is needed to analyse mutex functions' implementations and side-effects (possible internal loops, counters or flags).\n- metal_condition_t: the condition-variable type definition is needed to understand the implementation of condition wait/signal and any loops they contain.\n\nProvide the source/definitions for the listed functions and the declarations/types for the listed globals so the next analyst can check every for-statement and determine whether any loop counters or flags violate the MISRA well-formed for-loop requirements."
