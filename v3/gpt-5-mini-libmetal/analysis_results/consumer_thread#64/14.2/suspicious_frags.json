  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided consumer_thread function and the related code fragments (metal_condition_wait, mutex/condition declarations and counter). There are no for statements in any of the supplied code. The only loop present is a while (!counter) ... which is not subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (which specifically concerns for loops). No for-loop-like constructs (including in the shown macros/initializers) were provided, so there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 14.2. If there are other source files or macro definitions (e.g., METAL_CONDITION_INIT or METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE) not shown, those should be supplied\u2014only then can they be checked for for-loops that might violate Rule 14.2."
