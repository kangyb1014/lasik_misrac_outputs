  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not present pointer targets that could be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The assignment irq_handling_stop = true; involves a scalar boolean control variable, not a pointer. - metal_linux_irq_notify(); is a call with no arguments and thus no pointer parameters to check. - The if (ret) { ... } block and the metal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, ...) call only use integer values (ret) and format strings, not pointer targets requiring const qualification. - close(irq_notify_fd); operates on an integer file descriptor, not a pointer. Other pointer uses in the listed suspicious fragments should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified."
