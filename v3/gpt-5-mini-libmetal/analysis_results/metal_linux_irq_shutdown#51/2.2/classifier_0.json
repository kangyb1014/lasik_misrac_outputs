Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\n```c\nvoid metal_linux_irq_shutdown(void)\n{\n\tint ret;\n\n\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"%s\\n\", __func__);\n\tirq_handling_stop = true;\n\tmetal_linux_irq_notify();\n\tret = pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL);\n\tif (ret) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"Failed to join IRQ thread: %d.\\n\",\n\t\t\t  ret);\n\t}\n\tclose(irq_notify_fd);\n\tmetal_mutex_deinit(&irq_lock);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\nstatic bool irq_handling_stop\n...\nstatic pthread_t irq_pthread\n...\nstatic int irq_notify_fd\n...\nstatic metal_mutex_t irq_lock\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_linux_irq_notify();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to metal_linux_irq_notify() is intended to wake the IRQ thread after irq_handling_stop = true so that pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL) can complete; removing this call would change program behaviour (possible blocking or failure to terminate the thread). Therefore, in the presented context the call is not dead code. (A specific violation would occur if metal_linux_irq_notify() were implemented as a no-op or only performed logging \u2014 in that case removing the call would not affect behaviour and the call would be dead code.)"
