  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n1) struct metal_bus (definition; fields and types, especially 'name')\n   - Crucial to determine the type of bus->name (char * vs char[]), storage duration, and whether the name field has a fixed size. strlen can read past bounds if name is a non-terminated buffer or if its allocation size is smaller than the contents; only the struct definition tells you the exact representation and any implicit limit.\n\n2) metal_linux_register_bus\n   - This function is a direct caller of metal_bus_register (per the call graph). It's likely where struct metal_bus instances are created or their name field is assigned. To determine whether bus->name is guaranteed to be a null-terminated, valid string prior to the strlen call, you must inspect the code that constructs/initializes the bus (often in the immediate caller).\n\n3) metal_linux_probe_bus\n   - It is the caller of metal_linux_register_bus in the call chain. If bus objects or their name fields are created or inherited earlier in the probe path, their origin and guarantees (allocation, null-termination) may be visible only by following this caller chain up to probe. Include it to complete the trace that establishes how name is set.\n\n4) metal_bus_find\n   - Although metal_bus_find is only called after the strlen check, its declaration/definition is needed to confirm it does not modify the name pointer or its contents (which could affect whether a prior strlen was safe in other code paths). Also its prototype documents whether it expects a NUL-terminated string (const char *) which is relevant for correct usage of strlen.\n\n5) _metal (definition of the global _metal.common.bus_list) and declarations for metal_list_add_tail / metal_list_init\n   - These are not directly related to strlen safety but are required to fully understand side effects and lifetime semantics of the bus object (for example if list insertion or init change ownership or lifetime). Knowing object lifetime helps determine whether bus->name points to memory that remains valid and in-bounds at the time strlen is called.\n\nIn short: to judge whether strlen(bus->name) can access out-of-bounds memory you must know how 'name' is represented, where and how it is assigned/allocated (the caller chain: metal_linux_register_bus / metal_linux_probe_bus), and whether any other functions may mutate or free it (metal_bus_find, list helpers and ownership semantics). Inspecting these symbols will allow a precise MISRA C bounds-safety determination for the strlen use."
