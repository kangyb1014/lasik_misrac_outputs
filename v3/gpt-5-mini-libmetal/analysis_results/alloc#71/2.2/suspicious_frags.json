  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the if-block that tests the allocation result performs observable error handling (metal_log may have side effects and the function returns errno), so it is not dead; the return statements (return errno; and return 0;) are active control-flow and affect behaviour; the local declaration (void *ptr;) is used and therefore not dead; the metal_log invocation is an observable side-effect (logging) and thus not removable. The only operations that may be redundant (allocation immediately followed by free with no use of the allocated memory) are the allocation and the immediate free, which therefore have been reported for investigation."
