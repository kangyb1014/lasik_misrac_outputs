  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of alloc:\n```c\nstatic int alloc(void)\n{\n\tvoid *ptr;\n\n\tptr = metal_allocate_memory(1000);\n\tif (!ptr) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"failed to allocate memory\\n\");\n\t\treturn errno;\n\t}\n\n\tmetal_free_memory(ptr);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function alloc:\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n...\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nptr = metal_allocate_memory(1000);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The allocation call is used: the function checks ptr to detect allocation failure (logs and returns errno) and then frees the buffer. Removing the allocation (and associated ptr check and free) would change observable behaviour (it would no longer detect or log allocation failure, and it would change allocator state and timing). Therefore the statement ptr = metal_allocate_memory(1000); is not dead code in this context. (If, however, the allocator were proven to never fail, to have no observable side effects and the free fully negated any effect, then the pair could be considered redundant \u2014 but that is a property of the environment, not of the code shown.)"
