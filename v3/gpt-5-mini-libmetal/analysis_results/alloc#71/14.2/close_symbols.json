The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_allocate_memory (implementation): need the function body/definition to determine any persistent side effects, whether it modifies global/state objects (which could be used as loop counters elsewhere), and whether it itself contains for-loops whose clauses may violate the MISRA rule. The rule treats called functions\u2019 behaviour as part of the for-loop body.\\n- metal_free_memory (implementation): same reasons as metal_allocate_memory \u2014 must know if it changes objects visible to a surrounding for-loop or contains non-conforming for-loops.\\n- metal_log (declaration/implementation): alloc calls metal_log on allocation failure; its implementation could modify global state or objects that a for-loop might use as a counter/flag, or itself contain problematic for-loops.\\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG (macro/constant): the log-level symbol is used as an argument to metal_log; its definition may be a macro that expands to complex expressions or side-effecting constructs (rare but possible), so its expansion should be checked.\\n- errno (declaration/definition): alloc returns errno on failure. errno may be a macro that references thread-local storage or a function; its declaration/definition is required to know whether reading/returning errno has any side effects or aliases to objects that might be modified in a for-loop body.\\n\nThese symbols (implementations/declarations) are needed to reason about side effects, modifications of objects that might act as loop counters or flags, and any nested for-loops inside called functions \u2014 all of which are relevant to determining compliance with the MISRA requirement that a for loop be well-formed."
