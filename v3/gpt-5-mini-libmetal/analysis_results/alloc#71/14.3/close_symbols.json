  "explanation": "1) metal_allocate_memory (declaration + implementation or formal spec): The controlling expression in the function is if (!ptr). Whether that test is invariant depends entirely on what metal_allocate_memory can return (e.g. can it ever return NULL, or is it guaranteed to return a non-NULL/constant pointer, or is it a stub that always returns the same value). You need the function body or its formal contract to decide if the expression can vary at runtime. 2) NULL / null-pointer definition (relevant headers/platform docs): To correctly interpret the controlling expression !ptr you must know the platform/header definition/semantics of the null pointer constant used by the allocator (e.g. whether the allocator represents failure as NULL). 3) Allocator configuration macros / build-time stubs that affect metal_allocate_memory: In some builds metal_allocate_memory may be replaced by a macro or stub (compile-time configuration) that always returns a constant pointer (or always NULL). Those build-time symbols/configurations are required to determine whether the controlling expression is invariant under the intended build."
