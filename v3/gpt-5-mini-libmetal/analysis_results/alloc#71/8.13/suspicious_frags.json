  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers point to const-qualified types when possible. The only fragments that could affect the const-qualification of a pointer are the pointer declaration and the places where that pointer is assigned from an allocator or passed to functions. Other code fragments in the function (the function signature, the null check 'if (!ptr)', the logging call, and the return statements) do not declare or modify pointer types and therefore are not relevant to deciding whether a pointer should be const-qualified under Rule 8.13."
