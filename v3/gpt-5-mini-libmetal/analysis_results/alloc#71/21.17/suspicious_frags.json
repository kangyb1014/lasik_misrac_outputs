  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code and found no direct uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The alloc function only calls metal_allocate_memory and metal_free_memory (memory allocation/deallocation), which are not string.h functions in the shown code. The only locations that could potentially involve string-handling operations are the logging macro and its invocation because the macro expands to a call that passes metal_fmt(fmt) to a log handler; metal_fmt (not defined here) might employ string functions. Therefore I flagged the macro definition and its call site for investigation. All other fragments do not reference <string.h> functions and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
