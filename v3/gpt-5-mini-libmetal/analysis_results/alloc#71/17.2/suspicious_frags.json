  "explanation": "The function body contains no direct call to alloc, so there is no apparent direct recursion. The only places that could introduce indirect recursion are the external function calls; therefore those calls are reported for investigation. Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the local variable declaration (void *ptr;), the null check (if (!ptr) { ... }), the return statements (return errno; and return 0;), and the surrounding control structure do not by themselves create direct or indirect self-calls. There are no function pointer usages, no other function calls, and no additional code constructs in the snippet that could introduce recursion, so they are not suspicious for this rule."
