  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of iteration/selection statements (for/while/do-while/switch). The macro invocation for_each_linux_bus(lbus) is a control statement and must be checked to ensure the loop\u2019s controlling expression is not invariant (or that an allowed exception applies). The conditional expression in the loop body (metal_linux_probe_bus(lbus) ? 0 : 1) and the conditional expression in the return statement (valid ? 0 : -ENODEV) are included for investigation because they may be mistaken for controlling constructs or may hide constant-like behavior that affects control flow; they should be reviewed to confirm they are not used as invariant controlling expressions. Other fragments in the function \u2014 the function signature, the local declarations (struct linux_bus *lbus; int valid = 0;), the initialization of valid, and the fact that the loop body is a single statement \u2014 are not controlling expressions and therefore do not fall under Rule 14.3 and do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
