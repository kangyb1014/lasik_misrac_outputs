The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "for_each_linux_bus - The macro that appears in the source. You must see its expansion to determine the three for-clauses (init/condition/post), what is the loop counter, whether more than one counter is introduced, and which other objects (e.g. list head) are used in the loop condition or modification expressions.\n\nlist_for_each_entry, list_first_entry, list_next_entry, container_of - Typical helper macros used to implement for_each_linux_bus. Their expansions show whether the loop condition uses only the loop counter or also other objects, whether the post-clause modifies only the loop counter, and whether any hidden temporaries or multiple counters are introduced.\n\nlinux_buses - The global list head (or equivalent) that the iterator macro likely tests against in the loop condition. If this object is used in the loop condition and is modified in the loop body (directly or via callees), that can violate the MISRA requirement for the second clause.\n\nstruct linux_bus - The type of the loop counter (lbus). The structure definition reveals the list node member name used by the iterator macros and whether callees could reasonably mutate fields of the same object that control iteration.\n\nmetal_linux_probe_bus - The function called in the loop body. MISRA counts the behaviour of any functions called inside the for statement as part of the loop body; you must inspect this function to see whether it modifies the loop counter (lbus), the list head (linux_buses), or any other object used in the loop clauses.\n\nmetal_linux_probe_driver, metal_linux_bus_close, metal_linux_register_bus - Direct callees of metal_linux_probe_bus (per the static call graph). Any of these may remove, free, or otherwise modify the iterated node or list head; their implementations are needed to determine whether the loop body changes objects used by the loop clauses.\n\nlist_del, kfree - Common list-manipulation and deallocation primitives that, if called (directly or via the functions above), would modify the list structure or free the loop-counter object. Their use inside the loop body or in its callees is precisely the kind of behaviour that can make a for loop non well-formed under the MISRA rule.\n\n(Goal: obtain the macro expansion for for_each_linux_bus and the source of the listed functions/helpers so you can determine which objects appear in the for init/cond/post expressions and whether any of those objects are modified by the loop body or its callees.)"
