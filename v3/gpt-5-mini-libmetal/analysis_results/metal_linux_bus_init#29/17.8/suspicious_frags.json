  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in metal_linux_bus_init (signature: int metal_linux_bus_init(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function. The only identifiers in the body are local variables (struct linux_bus *lbus; int valid), and lbus is used as an iteration variable (for_each_linux_bus(lbus)) \u2014 any assignments performed by that macro affect a local variable, not a function parameter. The call metal_linux_probe_bus(lbus) passes the pointer by value; modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule, and any modification of the pointer parameter inside metal_linux_probe_bus would be an issue local to that function (not this one). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
