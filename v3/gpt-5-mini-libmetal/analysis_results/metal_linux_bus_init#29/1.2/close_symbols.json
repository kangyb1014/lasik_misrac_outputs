  "explanation": "You must inspect the macros/type definitions used by the for_each_linux_bus iteration to detect any compiler language extensions (e.g. GCC typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), or other non\u2011standard constructs). Explanation for each symbol:\n\n- for_each_linux_bus: This is the loop macro used in the target function. Its definition/expansion must be examined to see whether it itself uses any compiler extensions.\n- list_for_each_entry: Typical implementations of for_each_xxx rely on the generic list_for_each_entry macro. That macro historically uses typeof or statement-expressions; inspect its definition to detect such extensions.\n- list_entry: Often used by list traversal macros to compute container pointers; its implementation may use container_of/typeof patterns that are compiler extensions.\n- container_of: Common kernel macro that often uses typeof to infer the containing type. You need its definition to verify whether it employs the typeof extension or other non\u2011standard constructs.\n- struct linux_bus: The struct definition is needed because the macros may reference a member name (e.g. list node member) or rely on sizeof/offsetof patterns; knowing the layout helps locate which macro parameters are used and whether typeof/compound literals are invoked on this type.\n- struct list_head: The list macros operate on struct list_head; inspect its definition and how the macros manipulate it to determine whether any extensions are used (e.g. compound literals, typeof, statement expressions).\n\nCollect these definitions (the macro expansions and the struct declarations) so the next analyzer can determine if any language extensions are present in the code paths expanded by for_each_linux_bus."
