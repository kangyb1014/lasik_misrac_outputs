  "explanation": "Fragments not reported as suspicious: the field \"const char *bus_name\" is already const-qualified so it satisfies Rule 8.13; the field \"struct metal_bus bus;\" is not a pointer (so Rule 8.13 does not apply); the array \"struct linux_driver drivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\" is an array of structs (not a pointer type itself) and cannot directly be addressed as a non-const pointer without additional context; local variable \"int valid = 0;\" and the return expression are not pointer types. The listed fragments were chosen because they involve pointers or pointer usage in this code: (1) the local pointer declaration of lbus (could be const-qualified if the loop and callees do not modify the pointed data), (2) the loop macro that advances the lbus pointer, (3) the call site passing lbus into metal_linux_probe_bus (the prototype is not provided here, so this call-site should be checked to see whether the parameter could be a pointer-to-const), (4) the macro definition that uses/advances the pointer, and (5) the non-const pointer field \"struct sysfs_bus *sbus\" inside struct linux_bus. These are the locations that should be investigated to determine whether the pointers can and should point to const-qualified types."
