  "explanation": "1) metal_generic_dev_sys_open: You must inspect the body of this callee to determine if it calls metal_generic_dev_open (direct recursion) or calls itself (direct recursion). Without its definition you cannot prove there is no direct or immediate indirect recursion.\n\n2) All transitive callees of metal_generic_dev_sys_open: Even if metal_generic_dev_sys_open does not directly call metal_generic_dev_open, it may call other functions that eventually call metal_generic_dev_open (indirect recursion). You need the definitions of every function in the transitive call chain originating from metal_generic_dev_sys_open to determine whether any path returns to metal_generic_dev_open (or to metal_generic_dev_sys_open itself).\n\n3) Function-pointer members invoked by metal_generic_dev_sys_open (device/bus callbacks): If metal_generic_dev_sys_open invokes callbacks through function pointers stored in structs (for example device operation tables or bus callbacks), those function-pointer targets are potential indirect callees. You must resolve which concrete functions can be called via those pointers (their definitions) to see if any invocation path leads back to metal_generic_dev_open (or creates recursion).\n\nIn short, to verify compliance with the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion you must examine metal_generic_dev_sys_open and every function it can call (including indirect calls via function pointers) to ensure no call path returns to the target function."
