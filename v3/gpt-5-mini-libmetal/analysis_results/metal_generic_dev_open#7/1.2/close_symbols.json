  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each: This is almost certainly a macro; its expansion must be inspected to see if it uses compiler extensions (e.g. GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, implicit compound literals, or other non\u2011standard constructs).\n- metal_container_of: Commonly implemented as a macro that can use offsetof or compiler extensions like typeof or builtins; its definition must be checked for language\u2011extension usage.\n- struct metal_list: The layout/fields (e.g. anonymous unions/structs, bitfields, or compiler\u2011specific attributes) can hide use of extensions in the macros that iterate or index it; need its definition to understand how the iterator macro expands and whether non\u2011standard features are used.\n- struct metal_device: Required to verify the type of dev->name and dev->node and to check for anonymous members or compiler attributes (extensions) in the struct definition.\n- _metal (global) / its type that defines generic_device_list: The global and its type are referenced via _metal.common.generic_device_list; the type definition may use anonymous structs/unions or attributes (extensions) that would violate the rule.\n- generic_device_list (member): Inspecting this member\u2019s type/definition clarifies how metal_list_for_each is called and whether any extension is involved in its use.\n- strcmp: Although a standard library call, include its declaration context if the project replaces or wraps it with a macro or extension\u2011using implementation.\n- ENODEV: The error macro comes from errno headers; include to confirm it is the standard macro and not redefined via compiler\u2011specific constructs.\n\nThese symbols allow inspection of macro expansions, struct definitions, and global declarations to determine whether any non\u2011standard compiler language extensions are used in the target function\u2019s code paths."
