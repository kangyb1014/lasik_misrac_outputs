  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function appear to be invariant. Details:\n\n- The iteration macro expands to: for ((node) = (list)->next; (node) != (list); (node) = (node)->next)\n  - The controlling expression of the for loop is (node) != (list). This is not invariant because node is updated each iteration by the iteration expression (node) = (node)->next; therefore the condition depends on a changing value.\n\n- The selection statement uses strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0. The result depends on the runtime values of dev->name and dev_name, so it is not invariant.\n\n- The (void)bus; statement and the metal_container_of macro expansion do not introduce controlling expressions relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\n- No do-while or intentional infinite-loop constant controlling expressions are present that would fall under the rule exceptions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3."
