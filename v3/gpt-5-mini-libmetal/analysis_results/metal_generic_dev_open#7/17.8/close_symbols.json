  "explanation": "You need the listed symbols to determine whether any of the function's formal parameters are being modified (the MISRA rule prohibits modifying the pointer parameter itself; modifying the object pointed-to is allowed). Specifically:\n\n- metal_list_for_each: This macro expands into loop code that could (depending on implementation) assign to or otherwise modify identifiers in scope. Confirming its expansion ensures it does not assign to any of the formal parameters (bus, dev_name, device).\n\n- metal_container_of: This macro computes a pointer from a list node. Its expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameters or perform casts/assignments that would constitute modification of a formal parameter.\n\n- struct metal_device: You must know the types of members 'name' and 'node' to see that the code writes '*device = dev' (an assignment to the object pointed to by the parameter 'device', which is permitted) and that using dev->name with strcmp does not modify dev_name or the parameter itself.\n\n- struct metal_list: Needed to understand how nodes are traversed and whether the traversal code could alias or modify function parameters.\n\n- _metal (common.generic_device_list): The concrete type/definition of the list being iterated is needed to inspect the interaction with the loop macros and confirm no parameter modification occurs via global/list operations.\n\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open prototype: While the callee cannot change the caller's formal parameter variables, having the prototype confirms the argument passed (dev) is not the function's parameter variable 'device' itself; it also helps ensure there is no macro trickery that might mutate a formal parameter via the call expression.\n\n- strcmp prototype: To confirm it takes const char * arguments and does not modify dev_name; this supports the conclusion that dev_name (a const char *) is not modified.\n\nTogether these symbols allow inspection of macro expansions, type layouts and call semantics to decide whether any of the formal parameters (bus, dev_name, device) are directly assigned to or otherwise modified in violation of the MISRA rule."
