  "explanation": "struct metal_device: required to know the exact type and storage of the member 'name' (e.g. char * vs fixed char array and buffer length). The MISRA rule concerns comparing null\u2011terminated strings \u2014 you must confirm that dev->name is in fact a null\u2011terminated C string so that use of string comparison functions is appropriate.\n\nstrcmp: the target function uses strcmp to compare dev->name and dev_name. You must examine the declaration/implementation (and any project-specific macro or inline wrapper that replaces strcmp) to ensure strcmp is not implemented by or aliased to memcmp (or otherwise uses memcmp internally), because that would constitute a violation of the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nmemcmp: include the declaration/implementation and any macros that alias it so you can detect whether strcmp (or other wrappers) are implemented in terms of memcmp. If strcmp is implemented with memcmp, the target function would indirectly violate the MISRA rule.\n\nmetal_generic_dev_sys_open: although not used for the string comparison in the loop, it is the only callee of the target function (per the call graph). To be conservative, inspect its implementation for any memcmp usage that compares null\u2011terminated strings of the same data passed from the target function (or otherwise related string comparisons) so the overall behavior reachable from the target function does not violate the rule."
