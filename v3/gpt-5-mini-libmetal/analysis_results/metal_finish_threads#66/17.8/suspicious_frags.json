  "explanation": "No fragments in metal_finish_threads modify a function parameter. Analysis of each part: \n- The parameters are \"int threads\" and \"void *tids\". Neither parameter is assigned to after function entry (no statements like \"threads = ...\" or \"tids = ...\"), so the parameters themselves are not modified. \n- The line \"pthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids;\" only creates a local pointer initialized from the parameter; it does not modify the parameter object. Assigning the parameter value to a local variable is permitted; the rule forbids modifying the parameter, not reading or copying it. \n- The NULL check \"if (!tids)\" only reads the pointer value. \n- The loop and call \"(void)pthread_join(tid_p[i], NULL);\" use the object pointed to by the pointer (the thread identifiers) but do not change the pointer parameter itself. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule; in this code no write to the pointer parameter occurs. \n- The metal_log macro and its use do not alter the function parameters. \nTherefore there are no MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 violations in the provided function; no code fragments require further investigation for this rule."
