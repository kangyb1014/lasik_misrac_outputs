  "explanation": "- condition: This caller directly invokes metal_finish_threads (per the call graph). You must inspect its implementation to determine whether it ever calls metal_finish_threads with tids == NULL or with arguments that make the for-loop or the early-return path unreachable.\n- metal_run: Another direct caller. Its code is required for the same reason as above (to see if it ever passes NULL tids or otherwise prevents the loop from being executed).\n- metal_log: The target calls metal_log before returning when tids is NULL. If metal_log is non-returning (for example, it can abort/exit/longjmp), then the subsequent return statement would be unreachable. You must inspect metal_log to determine whether it can terminate control flow.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The log-level macro/constant used with metal_log may affect logging behaviour or be used by macros that alter control flow; include its definition to fully understand metal_log usage and any macros wrapping the log call.\n- pthread_join: The for-loop body calls pthread_join. While pthread_join itself normally returns, its implementation/behavior (or any platform-specific wrapper/macros) should be known to confirm that the loop body is reachable and does not implicitly abort or transfer control in a way that would make subsequent iterations or code unreachable.\n\nTogether these symbols let you determine whether the early-return path or the for-loop body in metal_finish_threads can or cannot be reached from real call sites, which is necessary to assess violation of the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
