  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- memcpy: The target function directly calls memcpy. To confirm the code uses memcpy (a copy operation) rather than memcmp (a comparison), and to check the exact prototype/semantics (e.g., pointer types) you must include memcpy's symbol/definition.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To determine whether the target function (or any of its callees) violates the rule, you must know whether memcmp is invoked directly or indirectly. Include memcmp so the analyzer can detect any use.\n\n- struct metal_sg: The function operates on arrays of struct metal_sg and accesses the fields virt and len. You need the struct definition to know the type of virt (char*/void*/other) and semantics of len (bytes/characters) to decide if the buffer(s) could be null-terminated strings and whether a comparison/copy would involve strings.\n\n- metal_cache_flush and metal_cache_invalidate: Both are called by the target function. Include their prototypes/definitions to ensure they do not call memcmp (or otherwise perform forbidden string comparisons) and to confirm they do not reinterpret virt as a C string.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_W: This macro/constant controls a conditional that changes behavior. Include its definition to verify the condition is not masking a memcmp usage or changing semantics relevant to string handling.\n\n- <string.h> (or the translation unit that defines memcpy/memcmp): Include the header/prototypes for standard string functions so the analyzer can unambiguously identify calls to standard memcmp/memcpy and detect any macro aliases or replacements that might turn memcpy into a comparator or vice versa.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the target function (or its immediate callees) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings or otherwise violates the cited MISRA rule."
