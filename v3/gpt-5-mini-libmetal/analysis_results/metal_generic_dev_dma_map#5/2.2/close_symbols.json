  "explanation": "To decide whether any operation in metal_generic_dev_dma_map is dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) the analyzer needs the actual definitions/semantics of the following symbols:\n\n- metal_cache_flush: need the implementation/prototype to tell if the call has observable side effects (I/O, memory-mapped register writes, timing effects) or is a no-op. If it has no side effects on the target, the conditional call could be dead; if it has side effects or timing implications, it is not dead.\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate: same reasoning as metal_cache_flush. Its implementation determines whether the unconditional call inside the loop is observable or removable.\n\n- memcpy: need the declaration/implementation semantics (usually standard memcpy) to confirm it performs memory writes that affect program state when sg_out != sg_in. If memcpy is a macro/alias or can be optimized out on this platform, that affects whether the memcpy statement is dead.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_W: the macro/enum value is required to determine when the conditional branch (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) is taken; this affects whether metal_cache_flush is executed and thus whether that call is ever executed (and therefore whether it could be dead).\n\n- struct metal_sg: need the struct definition (types and qualifiers for members virt and len). If virt is volatile or accesses through virt produce side effects, or if len type/semantics matter, that affects whether cache operations or memcpy change observable behaviour.\n\n- struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: need their definitions/qualifiers to judge whether the (void)bus; (void)device; statements are truly no-ops. If either parameter is declared volatile or has an overloaded accessor (unlikely in C but macros or attributes could matter), then casting to void might have observable effects; otherwise these statements are normal dead no-ops and removal would not change behaviour.\n\nSupplying these symbol definitions/implementations allows a precise determination of whether the statements in the function (the two (void) casts, the memcpy, and the cache maintenance calls) are executed operations whose removal would or would not affect program behaviour per the MISRA dead-code rule."
