  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tif (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) {\n\t\t\tmetal_cache_flush(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t}\n\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n#define METAL_DMA_DEV_W 2\n...\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The conditional memcpy is executed only when sg_out and sg_in point to different arrays; removing the memcpy would change behavior in that case (sg_out would not receive the contents of sg_in). Therefore the memcpy is not dead code. No operation in the shown fragment is executed whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
