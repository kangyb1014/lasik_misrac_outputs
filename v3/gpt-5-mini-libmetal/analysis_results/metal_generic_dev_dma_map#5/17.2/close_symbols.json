  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_generic_dev_dma_map violates the MISRA rule prohibiting direct or indirect self-calls, you must examine all functions it calls and any functions those may call (the transitive call graph). Specifically:\n\n- metal_cache_flush: required so we can inspect its implementation (or macro expansion) to see whether it calls back to metal_generic_dev_dma_map or calls other functions that eventually do. If it is a wrapper or macro that invokes other functions, those must be followed.\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate: required for the same reason as metal_cache_flush; if it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_generic_dev_dma_map or any function that leads back to it, that would create indirect recursion.\n\n- metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap: included because the static call graph shows it also calls metal_cache_invalidate. If metal_cache_invalidate (or its callees) calls metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap, and unmap in turn calls map, that would form an indirect cycle involving metal_generic_dev_dma_map. Inspecting unmap avoids missing such multi-step cycles.\n\n- transitive callees of metal_cache_flush and metal_cache_invalidate (if any): you must follow the full chain of calls from those functions to ensure no path returns to metal_generic_dev_dma_map. This includes any functions invoked via function pointers, macros, or indirect calls appearing in their implementations.\n\nProvide the full source/definitions (or at least prototypes plus bodies) of these symbols and any functions they call so the call graph can be resolved transitively and checked for cycles that include metal_generic_dev_dma_map."
