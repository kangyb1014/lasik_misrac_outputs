If code using metal_device only reads the bus and does not modify the bus object through this pointer, the pointer should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const struct metal_bus *bus) per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Similarly, 'void *irq_info' could be const-qualified if it is only read and never modified.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 R8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified through that pointer. However, the report is not correct for this code as presented for two reasons:\n\n1) The parameters of metal_generic_dev_dma_map (struct metal_bus *bus, struct metal_device *device) are currently part of an established API/signature (they are explicitly void-cast inside the function). If this function implements or matches an existing callback/function-pointer type, the parameter types cannot be changed without breaking the API. MISRA allows exceptions where const-qualification cannot be applied due to required interfaces.\n\n2) The agent's suggestion to change the field in struct metal_device from struct metal_bus *bus to const struct metal_bus *bus is unsafe without further analysis of the whole code base. The bus object is likely mutable (lists of devices, bus operations, etc.) and code elsewhere may legitimately modify the bus through that pointer (or assign to device->bus during initialization). Similarly, irq_info is a void* that may be written to; it cannot be assumed to be read-only. Therefore the struct field declarations as non-const are plausible and not demonstrably violating R8.13.\n\nIf, in a specific compilation unit, a pointer is provably only used for reading and not part of an API that forbids const, then qualifying it const would satisfy R8.13. But given the API/struct definitions shown and typical usage, there is no clear MISRA R8.13 violation here."
