True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe struct member metal_sg::virt is declared as void * (non-const) and is passed to metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate. These cache operations conceptually do not modify the pointed-to objects, so the pointer could and should be const-qualified (const void *). Therefore the use of a non-const pointer here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate actually modify the pointed-to memory or the API requires a non-const pointer, then this would not be a violation.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is plausible but not provably correct from the code shown. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointer types be const-qualified when they do not permit modification of the pointed-to object. The snippet shows metal_sg::virt declared as void * and passed to metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate. Whether this is a Rule 8.13 violation depends on additional facts not present here: if the pointed-at buffers are ever modified through virt (e.g. written to by the CPU or by APIs that take non-const pointers), or if metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate are declared to take a non-const void * (or otherwise require a modifiable pointer), then making virt const would be incorrect and there is no violation. Conversely, if none of the uses mutate the pointed-to data and the cache APIs accept const void *, then the member could and should be const-qualified and the code would breach Rule 8.13.\n\nTherefore, given only the provided code and without the prototypes/usages of metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate and other uses of metal_sg::virt, the report is not proven correct. To decide definitively, inspect: (1) the declarations of metal_cache_flush and metal_cache_invalidate (do they accept const void *?), and (2) all uses of metal_sg::virt to see whether any write-through or APIs requiring non-const pointers occur."
