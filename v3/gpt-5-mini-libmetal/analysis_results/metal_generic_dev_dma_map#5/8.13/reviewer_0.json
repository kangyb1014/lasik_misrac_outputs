  "explanation": "MISRA 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever doing so does not restrict needed mutability. Agent A flagged this function because struct metal_sg::virt is declared as void * while in this function it is only passed to cache operations (read-only semantics here). That local use alone does not prove the pointer can be const: the rule is evaluated at the declaration site (struct metal_sg) and across all uses. In typical DMA/IO code the virt field represents a CPU buffer that may be written to (by the CPU or device), mapped for I/O, or otherwise used by APIs that expect a non-const pointer; also the cache helper APIs may be declared to accept non-const pointers. Without examining all uses and the APIs that take metal_sg, you cannot conclude making virt const is safe. Furthermore, the alleged violation would be at the struct metal_sg definition, not in metal_generic_dev_dma_map itself. Therefore the report is not justified based on the provided evidence."
