  "explanation": "Agent A is not correct to claim a definite MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 violation here. Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible, but that is not an absolute mandate that overrides API compatibility. In this code the parameters bus and device are unused (they are explicitly cast to void), which only shows they are unused in this implementation \u2014 it does not prove that they can be changed to const in the broader API. Most likely this function is implementing a predefined callback/signature (e.g. a bus ops entry) that requires non-const struct metal_bus * and struct metal_device *; changing them to const would change the function type and break compatibility with the callers/function-pointer table. Thus, unless you can change the corresponding prototype in the public API (and all callers) to accept pointers-to-const, this implementation is acceptable and does not necessarily violate 8.13. If the prototype can be changed consistently across the API, then making them pointers-to-const would be an improvement."
