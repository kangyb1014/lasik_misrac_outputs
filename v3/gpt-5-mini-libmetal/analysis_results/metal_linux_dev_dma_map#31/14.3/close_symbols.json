  "explanation": "You only need the few symbols that could change how the single statement in the target function is interpreted or that might expand (via macros) into control constructs. Explainations:\n\n- to_linux_device (function or macro): the call may be a macro that expands into other code. We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce any controlling expressions (if/while/for/switch) into the target function via macro expansion.\n\n- to_linux_bus (function or macro): same reason as above \u2014 a macro expansion could introduce control statements; if it is a function we still include it to confirm it is a simple cast/lookup and not an inline control construct.\n\n- struct linux_device (definition; must show field 'ldrv'): the target uses ldev->ldrv; we need the struct to determine whether 'ldrv' is a simple pointer/member access or a more complex construct (bit-field, accessor macro), and to know the type of ldrv for further inspection.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): included to confirm that passing lbus as an argument is a plain object and that no hidden control semantics are involved (e.g., overloaded macro name).\n\n- definition of ldrv's type (e.g. struct linux_driver) including the member 'dev_dma_map' and its prototype/type: the code calls ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map(...). We must know whether dev_dma_map is a function pointer, a macro, or an inline function; its declaration tells us whether the call could expand to control statements inside this translation unit (via macro) or whether it is just a call expression (which does not introduce a controlling expression in this function).\n\n- implementation or prototype of dev_dma_map (if not just a function-pointer type): if dev_dma_map is a macro or inline function, its body could introduce control statements. To be conservative we need its definition to check for invariant controlling expressions only if it expands into the body within this function\u2019s translation unit.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): to inspect to_linux_device implementation (it may reference fields) and to ensure no macro weirdness that would affect the target function's controlling expressions.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): same reason as metal_device \u2014 used by to_linux_bus or by the call; ensure no macro/inline weirdness.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): the target passes sg_in/sg_out; include to be sure these are plain types and that no macros/overloaded names hide control constructs.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32_t (or included stdint.h): trivial, but include to complete the type view; not expected to affect control expressions.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule concerns invariant controlling expressions (in if/for/while/switch). The target function has no explicit control statements, so the only way this function could violate the rule is if some identifier used here is a macro that expands to control constructs (or if the dev_dma_map invocation is a macro/inline that injects control flow into the caller's translation unit). The symbols above are exactly those needed to confirm that no such macro expansions or inlined bodies introduce invariant controlling expressions into the target function."
