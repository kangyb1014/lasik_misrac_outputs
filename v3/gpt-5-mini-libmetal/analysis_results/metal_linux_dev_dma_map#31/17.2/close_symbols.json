  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check for (direct or indirect) recursion:\n\n- to_linux_device: the target calls this helper; we must inspect its body to ensure it does not call back (directly or indirectly) to metal_linux_dev_dma_map.\n\n- to_linux_bus: same reason as above \u2014 it is called by the target and could be part of a recursive call chain.\n\n- struct linux_device: needed to resolve the type and layout of ldev and to locate the ldrv member (the driver pointer) so we can determine what function pointer is actually invoked.\n\n- struct linux_bus: needed to inspect fields that might hold callbacks or references that could participate in an indirect recursive path.\n\n- ldev->ldrv (driver struct type) and its dev_dma_map member: the target calls ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map via a function pointer. We must know the exact member name/type to find where implementations are assigned and what functions can be invoked.\n\n- prototype/type of dev_dma_map: to match candidate implementations (signatures) and to locate all functions that can legally be assigned to this pointer.\n\n- All concrete functions assigned to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map (driver dev_dma_map implementations): each possible target of the function-pointer call must be inspected to see whether it (directly or transitively) calls metal_linux_dev_dma_map.\n\n- Driver registration/initialization code that sets dev_dma_map: to find which implementation(s) are actually installed into ldrv->dev_dma_map at runtime/initialization and therefore which code paths to analyze.\n\n- Transitive callees of the dev_dma_map implementations (their call chains): to detect indirect recursion we must follow the full call chains starting from each dev_dma_map implementation to see if any path leads back to metal_linux_dev_dma_map.\n\nIn short: because the target invokes a function pointer (ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map), you must obtain the pointer's declaration, the assignments that set it, all possible target functions, and the bodies of those targets (and their callees), plus the small helpers to_linux_device/to_linux_bus and the relevant struct definitions, to prove there is no direct or indirect recursion involving metal_linux_dev_dma_map."
