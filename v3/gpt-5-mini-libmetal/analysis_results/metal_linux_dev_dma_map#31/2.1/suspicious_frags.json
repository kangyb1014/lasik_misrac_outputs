  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided fragments. Reasons:\n- metal_linux_dev_dma_map is a simple, straight-line function: it computes two pointers and immediately returns the result of calling ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. There are no statements after the return, no conditional branches, and no loop constructs that could introduce unreachable code.\n- The helper functions to_linux_device and to_linux_bus simply return the result of metal_container_of; they contain a single return statement and no branches or code that could be unreachable.\n- The struct definitions (linux_device, linux_bus) only declare members and contain no executable code; therefore they cannot contain unreachable executable code in the shown excerpts.\n- Potential issues such as possible null-pointer dereferences (e.g., ldev or ldev->ldrv being NULL) are runtime correctness/safety concerns, not violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code).\nGiven the provided code, there are no code fragments that appear to be unreachable and therefore none require investigation for Rule 2.1."
