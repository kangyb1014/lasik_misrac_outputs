  "explanation": "The provided function contains no use of memcmp, no string or character-array comparisons, and no calls to string.h functions (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.). It only performs pointer conversions (to_linux_device, to_linux_bus) and invokes a function pointer (ldrv->dev_dma_map). Therefore there are no in-fragment occurrences of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings to report. Note: the implementation of ldrv->dev_dma_map is not shown; any memcmp usage inside that external function is outside the submitted code fragment and thus not subject to this fragment-level inspection."
