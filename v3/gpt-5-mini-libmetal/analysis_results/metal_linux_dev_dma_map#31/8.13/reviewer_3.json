If sg_in is intended to be input-only, it should be declared const (const struct metal_sg *) and the callee\u2019s prototype should accept a const-qualified pointer. Similarly, ldev/lbus could be const if they are only read. Because an input pointer is not const-qualified here, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 is a \u201cshould\u201d that recommends qualifying pointer targets with const when they are not modified. Agent A\u2019s observation \u2014 that sg_in is used only as an input in this function and so could be const \u2014 is plausible. However, the code shown merely forwards sg_in to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. Whether sg_in can be declared const here depends on the callee\u2019s prototype and on whether any caller or implementation expects to modify the pointed-to data. If dev_dma_map (or other uses) requires a non-const struct metal_sg * (i.e. it may modify the SG entries or the API purposely uses non-const), then this wrapper cannot make sg_in const without changing the API. The snippet alone does not provide evidence that sg_in (or ldev/lbus) could safely be const-qualified. Therefore the claim of a definite MISRA 8.13 violation is not supported by the provided code; you must inspect the callee prototype and all uses to determine if const qualification is possible. If the callee does not modify the data and its prototype can be changed, then making sg_in const would satisfy 8.13 (otherwise a justified deviation is required)."
