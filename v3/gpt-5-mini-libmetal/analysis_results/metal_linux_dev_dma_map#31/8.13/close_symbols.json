  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- to_linux_device (prototype): The target function calls this to obtain ldev. We must know its parameter and return types (including const qualifiers) to determine whether the incoming struct metal_device * could/should be a pointer-to-const. If the helper accepts a const pointer or returns a pointer derived from a const input, that affects whether metal_device should be const here.\n\n- to_linux_bus (prototype): Same rationale for struct metal_bus *bus \u2014 knowing whether this conversion accepts/returns const affects whether bus can be const-qualified.\n\n- struct linux_device (definition): The local variable ldev is a pointer to this type and the code accesses ldev->ldrv. We need the definition to know the type of ldev->ldrv and whether any const qualifiers exist on members which could force or allow const qualification of the pointer.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): lbus is passed to dev_dma_map. The definition and any const annotations on its declaration are needed to decide if lbus could be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- struct linux_driver / ldrv member (definition): ldev->ldrv is dereferenced to call dev_dma_map. We need the driver type to find the dev_dma_map member and its prototype.\n\n- dev_dma_map (function-pointer prototype inside linux_driver): Crucial \u2014 this gives the exact parameter types and const qualifiers for the function actually invoked. If dev_dma_map\u2019s signature requires non-const pointers for sg_in/sg_out, ldev, or lbus, then the wrapper cannot make them const. Conversely, if dev_dma_map accepts const for inputs (e.g., sg_in), the wrapper could accept const too. This is the primary symbol for assessing whether pointer-to-const is possible.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): sg_in and sg_out are pointers to this type. To decide whether they should be const-qualified (input-only vs output), we must know the structure and intended use; e.g., if sg_in is only read by dev_dma_map (and not modified), it should be const.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): To assess whether the parameter struct metal_device *device could be const, we need its definition to see whether the wrapper or callee modify it, and to check interactions with to_linux_device and dev_dma_map prototypes.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): Same as metal_device: to determine whether bus can be const-qualified, we must inspect its definition and how it is used by to_linux_bus and dev_dma_map.\n\nIn short: to determine if any pointer parameters (bus, device, sg_in, sg_out, and local lbus/ldev) can or should be pointers-to-const, we must examine the conversion helpers\u2019 prototypes, the downstream driver callback prototype (dev_dma_map) and the involved struct definitions to see whether the pointed-to objects are modified or required non-const by called functions."
