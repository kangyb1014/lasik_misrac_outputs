  "scenario": "lbus is obtained from a non-const input (bus) and immediately passed to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. Because the pointer is used where a non-const linux_bus* is required, the declaration matches its usage and does not violate Rule 8.13. (If dev_dma_map and all callers actually do not modify the object, then lbus could be declared as pointer-to-const and the current code would be a violation \u2014 but that cannot be determined from the fragment.)"
