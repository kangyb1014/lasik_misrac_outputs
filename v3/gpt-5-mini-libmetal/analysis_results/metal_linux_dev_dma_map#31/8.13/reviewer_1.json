According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, input pointers should be const-qualified when possible \u2014 e.g. 'const struct metal_sg *sg_in'. Likewise, if 'bus' and 'device' are not modified by this function or by helpers they are only passed to, they should be declared with const as well. Therefore the current declaration violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointer parameters be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In the body of metal_linux_dev_dma_map the parameters bus, device and sg_in are not modified by this function itself, so at first glance they could be candidates for const qualification. However the function simply forwards these pointers to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. If the dev_dma_map callback is declared to take non-const pointers (e.g. struct metal_sg *), then the wrapper cannot safely change its parameter types to const without changing the called API (or inserting casts, which would themselves be problematic under MISRA). Conversely, if dev_dma_map already accepts const for those parameters, then the wrapper should be changed accordingly and there is a rule violation as reported. Because the posted code does not include the prototype of dev_dma_map (or the driver API), you cannot determine from this snippet alone whether marking the parameters const is possible. Therefore the agent's report is not provably correct from the shown code \u2014 the real verdict depends on the called function's signatures. Recommended action: inspect/change the dev_dma_map callback prototype (and any calling sites) to use const where appropriate, then mark these wrapper parameters const as well."
