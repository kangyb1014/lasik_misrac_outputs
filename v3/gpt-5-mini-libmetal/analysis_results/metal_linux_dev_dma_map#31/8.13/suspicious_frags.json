  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointer types that could be const-qualified: - The return type (int) and non-pointer parameters (uint32_t dir, int nents_in) are not applicable. - The function body contains only the local pointer initializations and the call (which are included above); there are no other pointer expressions or pointer arithmetic to consider. Note: sg_out is included in the function signature fragment because it is a pointer parameter; it may intentionally be non-const if used as output, but it still must be reviewed. The listed fragments cover all pointer declarations and uses in the function, so no other parts of this function are relevant to Rule 8.13."
