  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nstatic int metal_linux_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\n\treturn ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map(lbus, ldev, dir, sg_in,\n\t\t\t\t       nents_in, sg_out);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_map:\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic int metal_linux_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tstruct linux_device *ldev = to_linux_device(device);\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\n\treturn ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map(lbus, ldev, dir, sg_in,\n\t\t\t\t       nents_in, sg_out);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function contains no dead code. Both local variables (ldev, lbus) are used in the call and the return value directly depends on ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map(lbus, ldev, ...). Removing any executed operation would change behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
