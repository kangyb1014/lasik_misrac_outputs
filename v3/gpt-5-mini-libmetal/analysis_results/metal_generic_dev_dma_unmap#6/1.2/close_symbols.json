  "explanation": "metal_cache_invalidate: need its declaration/definition to determine whether it is a plain function or a macro/inline/extern with compiler-specific attributes or asm (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, GCC builtins). If it is a macro or carries non\u2011standard attributes, that would be a language extension violation. struct metal_sg: the layout (types of fields virt and len, any bitfields, flexible array members, anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, or GCC/clang extensions like __attribute__((packed))) must be inspected because the target function accesses sg[i].virt and sg[i].len; such extensions could make the target code use language extensions indirectly. struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: their definitions (and any associated typedefs/macros) must be checked for anonymous structs/unions, compiler attributes, or other non\u2011standard constructs \u2014 even though the function only casts them to void, their declarations could introduce language extensions into the translation unit. uint32_t typedef (e.g. from <stdint.h>): the underlying typedef must be confirmed to be a standard typedef and not a compiler extension (for example, typedefs using compiler builtin types or non\u2011standard headers). This ensures use of fixed-width integer types is not relying on extensions."
