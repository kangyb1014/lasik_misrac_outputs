  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent A\u2019s claim is not correct. The three (void)param; lines are the common idiom to indicate intentionally unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings. Although removing those statements does not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour, their purpose is to document intent and affect compile-time diagnostics; MISRA\u2019s concern with \u201cdead code\u201d is about operations that serve no purpose in the design/behaviour of the program, while explicit unused\u2011parameter markers are an accepted means to express intent. In practice MISRA guidance treats such markers as the appropriate way to handle unused parameters (or otherwise the parameter name would be omitted or a dedicated macro used). Therefore the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is not correct for this code."
