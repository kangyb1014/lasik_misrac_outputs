  "explanation": "1) metal_cache_invalidate \u2014 You must know its declaration and semantics (prototype, whether it is a simple inline/no-op, a macro, or a function that can modify memory, call longjmp, or perform other control-flow/side\u2011effects). The for-loop condition is i < nents; to show the controlling expression is not invariant we must be sure no callee invoked inside the loop can alter the values of i or nents (e.g. by writing through pointers that alias stack locals, by non\u2011local control flow, or by modifying objects that the loop condition depends on). Without the callee\u2019s semantics you cannot rule out that metal_cache_invalidate changes memory or control flow that would make the controlling expression invariant (or unexpectedly constant).  \n\n2) struct metal_sg \u2014 The definition (types of members virt and len) is required to determine aliasing/points\u2011to relationships for the pointer sg and the memory region passed to metal_cache_invalidate. If sg[i].virt can point to stack memory that contains nents or i, or if its type/attributes imply special behavior, that could allow the callee to affect the loop control expression. Knowing the exact member types also clarifies whether the second argument (sg[i].len) can influence callee behavior relevant to invariance.  \n\nNote: struct metal_bus, struct metal_device and the uint32_t dir parameter are not required because they are explicitly unused in the function ((void) casts). If metal_cache_invalidate itself calls other functions, their declarations/semantics should be included as well for a complete analysis."
