  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) we must know if the function itself can ever be invoked and whether its internal statements can ever execute. Specifically:\n\n- project-wide call sites of metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap (direct callers): If there are no direct callers anywhere in the project, the whole function is dead code. Finding all direct call sites is required to decide reachability.\n\n- function-pointer/ops-table initializers that may store &metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap (indirect callers, e.g. bus/device ops structs): The function may be referenced indirectly through function-pointer fields in structures or registration tables. Those initializers are potential call sites; they must be checked to avoid false conclusions about unreachability.\n\n- linker symbol map / export table entries for metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap (external references from other translation units/libraries): The function might be referenced by other object files or libraries (including ones not visible in a single TU). The link-time symbol map or export list reveals external references that make the function reachable.\n\n- definition of struct metal_sg (fields: virt, len): To reason about reachability of the loop body and the sg[i] access, we need the concrete layout/semantics of struct metal_sg (e.g. if it is a zero-length/flexible array, or contains attributes that affect indexing). This helps determine whether the loop body can be executed or might be effectively unreachable/optimized away by undefined behaviour assumptions.\n\n- definition/declaration of metal_cache_invalidate (including attributes like noreturn, weak, inline): Attributes on the callee could affect control flow analysis (e.g. a noreturn attribute would mean control does not return after the call). Also if the function is a macro/inline that expands differently, that could change reachability of subsequent code.\n\n- relevant preprocessor/build configuration symbols that control compilation/visibility of this function and its callers (e.g. CONFIG_* macros, conditional compilation flags): Conditional compilation can cause the function or its callers to be omitted from a particular build. You must know the active build configuration to decide if the function is actually present and reachable in the built project.\n\nCollecting these symbols (call sites, indirect references, linkage info, type/callee definitions, and build conditions) is sufficient to determine whether metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap or any statement inside it is unreachable in the target build, as required by the MISRA rule."
