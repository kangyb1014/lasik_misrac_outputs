  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp). The code only casts away unused parameters and iterates over an array of struct metal_sg, calling metal_cache_invalidate(sg[i].virt, sg[i].len). There are no comparisons of character pointers or operations on null-terminated strings in this fragment, so nothing here violates or triggers Rule 21.14. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere, it is not present in the supplied code and would need to be provided for review."
