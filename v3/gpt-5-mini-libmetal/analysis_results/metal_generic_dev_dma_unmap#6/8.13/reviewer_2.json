According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should be declared with a const-qualified pointer (e.g. 'const struct metal_device *device') when possible.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The reported issue is not clearly a MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible, and indeed the parameter 'device' is unused and not modified in this implementation. However, the function has a public-style signature (likely matching a driver/API callback or function-pointer type) so changing the parameter to 'const struct metal_device *' could break the required interface. MISRA\u2019s \u201cshould\u201d guidance permits leaving a pointer non-const when doing so is necessary to match an external API; such cases must be documented as a deviation. In the absence of evidence that the signature can be changed safely, the agent\u2019s report is not correct. If this function is internal and the signature can be changed, then making the pointer const would satisfy 8.13; otherwise document a deviation."
