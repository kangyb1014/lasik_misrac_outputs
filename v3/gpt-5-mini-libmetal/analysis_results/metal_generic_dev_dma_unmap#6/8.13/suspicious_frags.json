  "explanation": "The rule concerns pointer parameters that could be qualified const. The remaining code fragments do not introduce additional pointer types that could be const-qualified (local variable 'i', parameter 'nents' and 'dir' are non-pointer scalars). The (void)bus, (void)device and (void)dir lines merely mark those parameters as unused and do not affect whether the pointer types themselves could be const-qualified. The loop and the call to metal_cache_invalidate read fields from the sg array but do not modify the sg objects themselves \u2014 these usages do not introduce other pointer-type candidates beyond the sg parameter already listed. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13."
