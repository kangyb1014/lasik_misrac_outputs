It should be declared as 'const struct metal_sg *sg' to satisfy Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in this case. The function only reads from the sg array (accesses sg[i].virt and sg[i].len) and does not modify the pointed-to metal_sg objects, so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer parameter should be to a const-qualified type (i.e. const struct metal_sg *sg). Making sg a pointer to const does not conflict with using its members (you can read members of a const struct), and the member virt (typically void *) can still be passed to metal_cache_invalidate. The only valid reasons not to change the signature would be external constraints (it must match an existing API or function-pointer type, or other callers expect a non-const signature). Absent such constraints, the current declaration violates Rule 8.13."
