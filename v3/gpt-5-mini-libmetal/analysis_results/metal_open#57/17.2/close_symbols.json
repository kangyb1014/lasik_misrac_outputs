  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_open violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analysis must consider any call paths that could form a cycle involving metal_open. The listed symbols are needed for that reachability/cycle analysis:\n\n- shm_open, open: Called directly by metal_open. We must inspect their implementations (or their wrappers) to ensure they do not call back into metal_open (directly or via other project functions).\n- strlen: Called directly by metal_open to check path length. Include to ensure it (or replaced/wrapper versions) does not introduce a call path back to metal_open.\n- metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_open: These are callers of metal_open (per the static call graph). They must be examined because a cycle can be formed only if there exists a path from metal_open back to one of its callers.\n- metal_uio_dev_bind, metal_uio_read_map_attr, metal_map, metal_io_init, metal_linux_irq_register_dev: Callees of metal_uio_dev_open. Include them to check whether any chain starting from metal_open could reach metal_uio_dev_open (or vice versa) and eventually return to metal_open, forming an indirect recursion.\n- metal_shmem_open_generic, metal_shmem_try_map: Callees of metal_shmem_open. Include them for the same reason: to inspect possible call chains that could complete a cycle involving metal_open.\n\n(Other symbols such as errno and POSIX macros/flags are irrelevant to recursion detection and are not required for establishing whether metal_open calls itself.)"
