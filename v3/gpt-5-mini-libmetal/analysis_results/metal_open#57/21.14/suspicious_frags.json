  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The only string operation is strlen(path) to check for an empty string; that does not involve memcmp and is not the rule target. Other calls (shm_open, open) and operations (flags/mode setup, errno handling) do not perform comparisons of null\u2011terminated strings via memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
