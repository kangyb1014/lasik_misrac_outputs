  "explanation": "strlen: The controlling expression uses !strlen(path). You must know the semantics/purity of strlen (it reads path memory and is not a compile\u2011time constant) to decide if the expression can be invariant or not. open, shm_open: The conditional operator is controlled by the parameter shm; open and shm_open are the two branches executed. While they are not the controlling expression themselves, their presence means the branch choice depends on shm \u2014 understanding these functions is useful when reasoning about whether callers always pick the same branch (making the controlling expression invariant). metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_open: These are the callers of metal_open. To determine if the controlling expressions inside metal_open are invariant you must inspect all call sites (the callers) to see what concrete values they pass for path and shm (e.g., always NULL, always empty string, or a constant shm value). If callers always pass invariant arguments, the controlling expressions in metal_open could be invariant and thus relevant to the MISRA rule."
