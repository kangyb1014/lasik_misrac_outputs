  "explanation": "No other pointer declarations or uses in this function need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter is declared as const char *path (already const-qualified), there are no non-const pointer variables, and the strlen(path) call expects a const-qualified pointer. The only place a pointer is passed to external APIs is the combined call above; it should be checked to ensure the prototypes of shm_open and open accept a const-qualified pointer (i.e., do not require a non-const char *), which could otherwise force discarding const qualification."
