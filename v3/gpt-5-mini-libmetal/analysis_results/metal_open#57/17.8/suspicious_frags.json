  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies any function parameter. The parameter path is declared const char *, and the code only reads from it (used in strlen and passed to shm_open/open), so neither the pointer nor the pointed-to object is modified. The integer parameter shm is only read in the conditional expression and never assigned to. All other identifiers (flags, mode, fd) are local variables. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no further investigation is necessary."
