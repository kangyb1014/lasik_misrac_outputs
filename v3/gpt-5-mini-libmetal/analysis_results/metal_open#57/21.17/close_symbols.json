  "explanation": "- strlen: The target function calls strlen(path). You must know the exact semantics (stops at NUL, reads bytes until NUL) to decide whether a non\u2011terminated buffer would produce an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Include the <string.h> prototype/implementation semantics.\n- metal_uio_dev_open: Immediate caller of metal_open. You must inspect its implementation and call sites to see what value it passes as path (origin, whether it can be NULL, whether it is guaranteed NUL\u2011terminated and properly sized).\n- metal_shmem_open: Immediate caller of metal_open. Inspect its implementation to determine how it constructs/passes path (could forward user data or construct buffers that might lack a terminating NUL).\n- shmem_child: Caller of metal_shmem_open (listed in the call graph). It may be the place where the path string is created or derived; inspect it to determine path provenance and lifetime.\n- metal_shmem_open_generic: Callee of metal_shmem_open; it may build or mutate the path buffer passed down to metal_open. Inspect it to verify any string operations (concatenation, copy, formatting) that could produce a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated or overlong string.\n- metal_shmem_try_map: Callee of metal_shmem_open; may participate in constructing or manipulating the path argument; inspect for any string handling that affects termination/length.\n- metal_uio_read_map_attr: Callee reachable from metal_uio_dev_open; it (or other helpers reached from metal_uio_dev_open) may construct the path passed to metal_open. Inspect these helpers for string operations that could leave path unterminated or overrun buffers.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule at issue concerns accesses beyond object bounds by standard string functions. The only string function used in metal_open is strlen(path). Whether that can access beyond the bounds depends entirely on the origin, construction, and guarantees about path provided by callers or helper routines. Therefore the next agent must examine strlen semantics and every caller/helper that creates or mutates the path string to determine if a NUL terminator and adequate buffer bounds are guaranteed."
