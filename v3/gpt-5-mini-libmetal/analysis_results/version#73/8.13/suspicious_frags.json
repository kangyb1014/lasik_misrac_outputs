  "explanation": "The only places where pointer-to-character objects cross module/function boundaries (and thus may need const qualification) are the two strcmp call sites above; these should be inspected to confirm the types of METAL_VER and the return type of metal_ver(). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the declarations 'char ver_def[16], ver_dyn[16];' are writable buffers populated by snprintf (so they must be modifiable), the snprintf calls write into those buffers (destination must be non-const), the numeric/version helper calls (metal_ver_major(), metal_ver_minor(), metal_ver_patch()) return scalar values (not pointers), and the return expression simply combines integer results \u2014 there are no other pointer declarations or pointer-to-object usages in this function that could be made const-qualified."
