  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of version() is unreachable you must inspect the actual definitions and declarations of all identifiers that can alter control flow or are macro substitutes: \n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH: these are used in the first snprintf. If they are macros (or expressions) that expand to control-flow constructs (e.g. do/return/longjmp) or to non-evaluating constructs, they could make subsequent statements unreachable. Their values also determine whether later strcmp results are always constant, but primarily we need their definitions to rule out control-flow effects.\n\n- METAL_VER: used in strcmp(ver_def, METAL_VER). If METAL_VER is a macro that expands to code (rather than a simple string literal), or if it hides side effects/noreturn behavior, it could affect reachability. Confirm it is a plain constant string.\n\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch: these callees are invoked before building ver_dyn. Their implementations (or macros) must be examined to see if they return normally. If any is annotated noreturn, calls exit/longjmp, or is a macro that contains a return, code after that call (including later snprintf/strcmp/return) could be unreachable.\n\n- metal_ver: same reason as above for the final strcmp call \u2014 its definition may be noreturn/side\u2011effecting and thus affect reachability of code following its call (and the correctness of the return expression).\n\n- snprintf and strcmp: these are library calls but could be macro-wrapped or replaced in the project. Their declarations (or macros) must be checked for attributes (noreturn), or unusual definitions that change control flow (e.g. if someone redefines snprintf to abort/longjmp). Confirm they behave as ordinary functions that return normally.\n\nInspecting the above symbols (their definitions, attributes, and whether any are macros that expand to control-flow statements) is sufficient to determine if any statements in version() can never be reached."
