  "explanation": "For a MISRA C analysis about out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses caused by string functions you must know the definitions, return ranges and guarantees of the following symbols:\n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH: their values (or value ranges) are required to compute the maximum number of characters produced by the \"%d.%d.%d\" formatting (digits + possible sign). This determines whether snprintf can overflow the 16\u2011byte local buffers.\n\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch (the functions): the runtime return types and possible value ranges (including sign) are required for the same worst\u2011case length calculation when the dynamic formatting is done into ver_dyn.\n\n- METAL_VER: the compile\u2011time version string (its length and that it is a properly NUL\u2011terminated string). strcmp reads until a NUL; if METAL_VER were not a valid NUL\u2011terminated object or longer than expected that could affect safety reasoning.\n\n- metal_ver (the function): its return type, the buffer it points to, and lifetime/guarantee that the returned char* is NUL\u2011terminated and points to accessible memory. strcmp will read the whole string, so any non\u2011terminated or invalid pointer can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads.\n\n- snprintf: the exact semantics of the snprintf implementation (standard C99 behaviour) are needed \u2014 specifically that it will not write more than the supplied size and that it will NUL\u2011terminate the buffer when size > 0, and its return value semantics (number of characters that would have been written). These properties are central to arguing that ver_def/ver_dyn are not written out of bounds and that they are NUL\u2011terminated for subsequent strcmp.\n\n- strcmp: its behaviour (it reads both strings until a NUL is found) is required to reason about whether comparing ver_def/ver_dyn and METAL_VER/metal_ver can cause reads beyond object bounds if any of them are not properly NUL\u2011terminated.\n\n- INT_MAX and INT_MIN: standard integer limits are useful to compute conservative worst\u2011case digit counts for %d (if the METAL_* macros or functions can reach full int range). This supports a sound bound on required buffer size.\n\nTogether these symbols allow verification that snprintf cannot write past ver_def/ver_dyn and that strcmp cannot read past any of the compared strings, satisfying the MISRA requirement about not accessing beyond object bounds via string.h functions."
