The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- metal_ver_major / metal_ver_minor / metal_ver_patch (function definitions/prototypes): these functions are called inside version(); to check the MISRA for\u2011loop rule you must know whether they have side effects, modify non\u2011local objects, or contain for\u2011loops themselves (the behaviour of functions called within a for statement is part of the loop body). Any side effects or internal loop violations in these functions could make a surrounding for loop ill\u2011formed.\n\n- metal_ver (function definition/prototype): returns a string and may use or modify static/global buffers. Its definition is needed to determine persistent side effects (modifying objects that might be loop counters or flags) or internal for\u2011loop violations.\n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR / METAL_VER_MINOR / METAL_VER_PATCH (macro/constant definitions): these macros might expand to expressions or function calls with side effects. You must verify they are pure constant expressions (no persistent side effects) as assumed by the for\u2011loop rule.\n\n- METAL_VER (macro/constant definition): verify it is a compile\u2011time string (no side effects) and does not expand to function calls or expressions that could affect loop correctness.\n\n- snprintf (declaration/semantics from <stdio.h>): version() calls snprintf which writes to buffers; you need to confirm snprintf only modifies the provided buffer(s) and has no other persistent side effects that could affect loop counters or flags when version() is invoked inside a for clause/body.\n\n- strcmp (declaration/semantics from <string.h>): used to compare strings; confirm it has no persistent side effects (reads only) so it cannot violate the for\u2011loop rule when called inside a loop clause.\n\n- any global/static objects referenced or modified by metal_ver, metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch (definitions): if these functions touch global/static objects (e.g. static buffers, global counters, flags) those objects could be loop counters or control flags in a caller's for loop. Their definitions are required to determine whether they are modified inside the called functions (which would violate the rule if those objects are used as loop counters or modified in the loop body).\n\nProvide the full definitions (bodies) of the listed functions/macros and any globals they use to allow a complete check against the MISRA for\u2011loop requirements."
