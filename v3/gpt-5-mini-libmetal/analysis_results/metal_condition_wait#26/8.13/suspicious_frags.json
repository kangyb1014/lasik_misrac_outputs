  "explanation": "I reported all places where pointers (or addresses of objects reachable via pointer parameters) are used or passed to other functions and where const-qualification might be applicable. In particular, the function parameters (cv, m) and all uses that take addresses of cv's members or pass the mutex pointer to other functions are included because those are the primary spots where a pointer-to-non-const might have been used where a pointer-to-const could be appropriate (e.g. a predicate function that only reads the mutex state).\n\nI did not report uses of plain integer/local variables (tmpmptr, mptr) because they are of integer type (uintptr_t) rather than pointer types and so are not relevant to Rule 8.13. I also did not separately list every direct member access (cv->mptr, cv->waiters, cv->wakeups) beyond the places where their addresses are taken or they are passed to functions, because those member-address usages are already covered by the listed fragments. The atomic operations and futex syscall take addresses of these members intentionally for modification or synchronization, so those are included for investigation; code that only operates on non-pointer/scalar locals (e.g. v, tmpmptr, mptr) need not be checked for pointer const-qualification."
