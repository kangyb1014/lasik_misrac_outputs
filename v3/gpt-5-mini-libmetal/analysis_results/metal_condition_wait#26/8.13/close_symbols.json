  "explanation": "For assessing whether pointers should be const-qualified you must know the concrete types and which objects are mutated by the callees and by the local operations. Each symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- struct metal_condition: needed to see the exact types of members (mptr, wakeups, waiters) and whether they are modified by this function; if members are not modified the pointer to cv might be a candidate for const.\n\n- metal_mutex_t: to know the underlying type of the mutex object so you can decide whether functions that take metal_mutex_t * could accept a const-qualified pointer (i.e. whether those functions mutate the mutex state).\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: its prototype shows whether it takes metal_mutex_t * or const metal_mutex_t * and whether it mutates the mutex; that affects whether m could/should be const.\n\n- metal_mutex_release and metal_mutex_acquire: their prototypes and semantics determine whether they modify the mutex object (they do), which justifies leaving m non-const; you need the declarations to confirm the parameter types.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub: these prototypes (from stdatomic.h or project equivalents) and the exact atomic types used tell you whether the operations take pointers-to-non-const atomic objects (they must, because they modify/read atomics) and whether taking their addresses forces non-const qualification of the pointed-to members.\n\n- (atomic) types of cv->mptr, cv->wakeups, cv->waiters (e.g. atomic_uintptr_t / atomic_int): the exact typedefs for these members are required to determine whether the members are modifiable atomics (so cv cannot be const) or plain scalars (and whether const would be possible).\n\n- uintptr_t typedef (stdint.h): to confirm types of tmpmptr/mptr and whether any implicit conversions would affect const qualification reasoning.\n\n- syscall / SYS_futex: the syscall is passed &cv->wakeups; you need the futex/syscall prototype and expected pointer type to check compatibility and whether the code is passing a pointer to a modifiable object (further evidence that cv->wakeups must be non-const).\n\nProviding these symbols lets the analyzer determine which pointers are actually modified (directly in this function or via callees/atomic ops/syscall) and therefore whether any pointer parameter or member could be made const in compliance with the MISRA rule."
