  "explanation": "For determining whether metal_condition_wait could violate the MISRA rule about string.h functions (out-of-bounds accesses by standard string functions), the next analyst needs the concrete definitions/implementations and types for any symbols that could (directly or indirectly) perform memory accesses or call library routines that might use string.h functions. Short rationale for each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_condition: shows the exact types and layout of cv->mptr, cv->wakeups and cv->waiters and whether any fields are pointers to buffers or wrappers that might be passed to string functions. Also required to check whether taking &cv->wakeups yields an object of the type expected by futex (no hidden buffer accesses).\n\n- metal_mutex_t: the mutex type definition may reveal embedded buffers or helpers that could invoke string routines when acquired/released; needed to rule out indirect string.h use.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired / metal_mutex_release / metal_mutex_acquire: full definitions (or at least their call graph) are required to ensure these functions do not internally call any of the string.h functions listed by MISRA (memcpy, memset, strlen, etc.) or perform out-of-bounds memory accesses.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong / atomic_load / atomic_fetch_add / atomic_fetch_sub: definitions/implementations or mapping to compiler builtins are needed to ensure these atomic primitives do not wrap a library routine that calls string.h functions or perform unexpected memory-copy operations.\n\n- atomic type(s) used for cv->mptr, cv->wakeups, cv->waiters: the concrete atomic typedefs (e.g., atomic_uintptr_t, atomic_int) are needed to check size/alignment and to ensure no implicit byte-wise operations that could rely on string routines.\n\n- syscall / SYS_futex / FUTEX_WAIT: the syscall call passes &cv->wakeups to the kernel futex interface. The analyst must confirm the type/size of wakeups matches the expected futex-type (int) and that no user-land wrapper around syscall invokes string.h functions. Also need SYS_futex and FUTEX_WAIT constants to understand the syscall semantics.\n\n- EINVAL: the error code macro is used as a return value; include it to ensure there are no hidden dependencies to string functions in any error-handling wrappers.\n\n- uintptr_t: the integer-pointer type used for mptr and tmpmptr; needed to confirm no pointer-to-buffer conversions that might later be passed to string functions.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst (1) inspect all objects whose addresses or values are used in memory operations, (2) inspect all callees for any internal use of string.h functions, and (3) verify that no pointers or buffers are passed to any of the listed standard string functions either directly in this function or indirectly via callees/atomic/syscall wrappers."
