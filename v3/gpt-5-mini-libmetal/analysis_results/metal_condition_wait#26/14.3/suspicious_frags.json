  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains only conditional statements (if) and no loops; none of the if conditions are constant expressions:\n\n- if (!cv || !m || !metal_mutex_is_acquired(m)) \u2014 depends on the pointer parameters and the runtime result of metal_mutex_is_acquired(m).\n- if (!atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&cv->mptr, &tmpmptr, mptr)) \u2014 the atomic compare-and-exchange operation reads and may update tmpmptr and depends on the runtime atomic state; its result is not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (tmpmptr != mptr) \u2014 tmpmptr is modified at runtime by the atomic operation, so this comparison is not invariant.\n\nThere are no while/for/do-while controlling expressions present that could be invariant (no infinite-loop constructs here). Other expressions (atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add/sub, syscall, mutex release/acquire) are not controlling expressions and thus not relevant to Rule 14.3. Therefore no fragments need investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
