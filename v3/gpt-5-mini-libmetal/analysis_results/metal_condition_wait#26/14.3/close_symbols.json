  "explanation": "For the MISRA rule check we must determine whether any controlling expression in metal_condition_wait is effectively invariant (always the same) in the function scope. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong (stdatomic): The first if() uses the return value of this call and relies on its side\u2011effect of updating the expected parameter (tmpmptr) on failure. Whether tmpmptr is changed (and thus whether the subsequent conditional tmpmptr != mptr is invariant) depends exactly on the semantics of this function.\n\n- atomic_load (stdatomic): atomic_load(&cv->wakeups) supplies the value passed to futex and could affect any later control flow in variants of the code; knowing that it reads a potentially changing atomic location (not a compile\u2011time constant) is important to conclude non\u2011invariance.\n\n- atomic_fetch_add / atomic_fetch_sub (stdatomic): These operate on cv->waiters; understanding that they change shared atomic state (and are not compile\u2011time constants) is necessary to reason about dynamic behavior and whether related expressions could be invariant.\n\n- struct metal_condition (fields mptr, wakeups, waiters): The types and semantics of these fields (especially mptr) are needed to know what the atomic operations operate on and whether their values can change (e.g., whether mptr is a shared, mutable field vs. a compile\u2011time constant).\n\n- type/representation of cv->mptr (atomic integer type / uintptr_t): The exact atomic type (and that it is not a const) and that it holds pointer values (uintptr_t) affects compare_exchange behavior and whether comparisons like tmpmptr != mptr can be treated as invariant.\n\n- syscall (OS syscall wrapper) and SYS_futex: The futex syscall is invoked using the loaded wakeups value; knowing that this is a runtime blocking call and that SYS_futex is a runtime constant clarifies that the controlling expressions are not compile\u2011time invariants and that the code expects runtime changes.\n\n- FUTEX_WAIT constant: Required to understand the semantics of the syscall invocation (it is a runtime blocking wait, not a compile\u2011time control expression).\n\n- EINVAL macro: Knowing what -EINVAL represents is not strictly required to detect invariance, but it helps interpret the error paths and whether early returns are used solely for constant checks.\n\nIn short, the atomic operation APIs and the concrete layout/types of struct metal_condition (and the syscall/futex constants) are essential to determine whether the conditionals in metal_condition_wait can be invariant or are dynamic checks influenced by concurrent/shared state."
