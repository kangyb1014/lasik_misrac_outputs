  "explanation": "No compiler-language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific points checked:\n- uintptr_t (stdint.h) and int are standard types \u2014 not extensions.\n- The atomic_* identifiers correspond to C11 <stdatomic.h> operations (standard C), not compiler-only extensions.\n- syscall(...) is a library/system-call wrapper; SYS_futex and FUTEX_WAIT are OS/kernel header macros (platform-specific), not compiler language extensions.\n- EINVAL is a standard errno macro from errno.h, return -EINVAL is not a language extension.\n- There are no GCC/Clang-specific tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- Control flow, pointer casts, and function calls are all standard C constructs.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that (per compiler documentation) use language extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
