Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",
  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The function contains no controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, ?: operator or calls that could act as loop/branch control); it only performs (void) casts on its parameters to suppress unused-variable warnings. There are therefore no controlling expressions to be invariant, so nothing outside this function (types of the parameters, struct definitions, macros or other functions) can introduce a controlling expression here. Consequently, no extra symbols are needed to determine compliance with the MISRA C rule about invariant controlling expressions."
