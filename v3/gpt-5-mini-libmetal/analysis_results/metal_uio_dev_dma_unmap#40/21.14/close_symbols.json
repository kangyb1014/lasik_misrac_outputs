  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Any direct call to memcmp in the target function would be a potential violation, so the memcmp symbol must be checked.\n- __builtin_memcmp: Some compilers provide a builtin intrinsic that behaves like memcmp; code can call this or the compiler may inline/replace memcmp with it. It must be considered equivalent for the rule.\n- bcmp: Historical/binary-compatibility functions (bcmp) are sometimes used instead of memcmp; they may be implemented via memcmp or be treated similarly by reviewers. Include it to catch alternative APIs that perform the same byte-wise comparison.\n- memcmp_s: Safer variant implementations may be present; while not the same as memcmp, their presence/usage helps decide whether a memcmp-style comparison is occurring or a safer API is used.\n- project-specific wrappers/macros that map to memcmp (e.g. metal_memcmp, os_memcmp, platform_memcmp): The codebase may use wrapper functions or macros that internally call memcmp. To determine an indirect violation you must inspect these symbols (or any macro that expands to memcmp) called from the target function or its callees.\n- size_t: The memcmp prototype uses size_t for the length argument. Knowing the size_t typedef (and the memcmp prototype) is necessary to interpret argument types and determine whether the arguments passed are pointers to null-terminated char arrays (strings) vs. raw buffers.\n- string.h (memcmp prototype): The declaration/prototype clarifies the parameter types (const void *, const void *, size_t) so the analyzer can match calls and reason about whether those arguments are null-terminated strings.\n\nNotes for the next agent: The target function as given contains no calls, so start by checking for any uses of the listed symbols in the function body and any functions it calls. Also scan for macros or inline wrappers that expand to memcmp (or the builtin) to catch indirect uses that would violate the MISRA constraint."
