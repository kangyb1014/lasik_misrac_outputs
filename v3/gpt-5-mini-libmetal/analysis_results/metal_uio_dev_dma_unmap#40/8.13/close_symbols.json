  "explanation": "For MISRA rule analysis you must know whether the pointer parameters could/should be const and whether the signature is constrained by an interface: \n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): needed to determine whether the function would ever need to modify members of linux_bus; if none of its members must be modified the pointer could be const. \n\n- struct linux_device (definition): same reason as linux_bus \u2014 the mutability of the pointed-to device depends on its definition and members. \n\n- struct metal_sg (definition, including member types): the SG list element types (and whether they are pointers themselves) determine whether metal_sg should be pointed-to via const. You must inspect member mutability to decide if sg can be const.\n\n- declaration/prototype of metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap (header) or the exact function\u2011pointer typedef/ops struct this function implements: if this function is required to match an existing API (a typedef or ops table signature), that API may require non\u2011const parameters and therefore prevent changing parameters to const even if the body does not modify them.\n\n- all callers of metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap (call sites): callers may rely on the function modifying the pointed-to objects or may pass non\u2011const pointers; examine callers to see whether the function is expected to mutate data or be used with const arguments.\n\n- any ops table or assignment site that stores a pointer to this function (where its address is taken): this shows whether the function is used as a callback and must match an existing function-pointer type; changing parameter constness could break type compatibility.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine both the internal possibility of making pointers const (based on type/member mutability) and the external constraints (required prototype/callers/ops table) that may forbid changing parameter types."
