This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The function body contains no calls (direct or indirect) and makes no use of its parameters other than casting them to void, so it does not invoke any of the <string.h> functions nor perform any pointer/size operations that could cause out-of-bounds string accesses. Therefore there are no external functions, type definitions, macros, globals or call targets that need to be provided to determine compliance with the MISRA C string-handling rule for this function."
