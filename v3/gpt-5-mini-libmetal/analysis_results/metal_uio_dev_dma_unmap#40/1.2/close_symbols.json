  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of the types appearing in its signature. Any of those definitions could themselves use language extensions (anonymous structs/unions, flexible array members, compiler __attribute__ annotations, packed/aligned pragmas, inline asm, compiler-specific typedefs/macros such as __extension__, etc.).\n\n- struct linux_bus: its definition might contain anonymous unions/structs, GCC attributes, packed/aligned pragmas or other compiler-specific constructs. Inspecting it is required to rule out use of extensions.\n- struct linux_device: same reason as linux_bus \u2014 the struct body could include language extensions that make the function interface rely on extensions.\n- uint32_t: typically comes from <stdint.h> or a platform header; the typedef or header could use compiler-provided typedefs or macros (or non-standard typedefs) that are considered extensions. Verify the exact typedef/definition used in the build.\n- struct metal_sg: scatter/gather descriptors often include bitfields, packed attributes or other target-specific annotations. Its definition must be checked for language extensions.\n\nNo other symbols in the function body appear to use extensions (the \"static\" storage class and the (void) unused-parameter casts are standard C); therefore only the above type definitions need to be inspected for possible compiler extensions."
