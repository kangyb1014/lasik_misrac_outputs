  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified', the analyzer must know the exact meaning of each parameter's declared type:\n\n- struct linux_bus: need its declaration/definition to confirm that the parameter lbus is a pointer to a structure (as written) and not e.g. an array or typedef that would change interpretation. This distinguishes modifying the pointer itself (forbidden) from modifying the pointed-to object (allowed).\n\n- struct linux_device: same reason for ldev \u2014 confirm it is a pointer-to-struct type and inspect any unusual typedefs/qualifiers that could affect whether assignment would modify the parameter itself.\n\n- struct metal_sg: same reason for sg \u2014 ensure it is indeed a pointer type in the signature and check for typedefs, qualifiers or unusual declarations that could alter semantics.\n\n- uint32_t: need the typedef/definition to be certain that dir is a plain scalar type (pass-by-value). If uint32_t were (unexpectedly) a typedef to a pointer type, modification rules differ; the analyzer must know whether assigning to dir would modify the parameter itself.\n\n- int: need to confirm nents is a plain by-value integer parameter (not e.g. a macro or typedef hiding a pointer type).\n\nNote: The function body contains only (void) casts of the parameters and no function calls or assignments. The symbols above are sufficient to verify that none of the parameter identifiers are being modified in this translation unit and to classify each parameter as a by-value scalar or a pointer-to-object (so the MISRA distinction between modifying the pointer vs. the pointed object can be applied). If any of those type symbols are macros or typedefs that expand to nonstandard forms, their definitions are required as well."
