  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\t    struct linux_device *ldev,\n\t\t\t\t    uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t    struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t    int nents)\n{\n\t(void) lbus;\n\t(void) ldev;\n\t(void) dir;\n\t(void) sg;\n\t(void) nents;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void) lbus;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement \"(void) lbus;\" is an explicit cast-to-void used to mark the parameter as intentionally unused (to suppress compiler warnings). This expression has no effect at runtime and could be removed without changing program behaviour, but it is the conventional, documented way to indicate an unused parameter and is not treated as dead code in this context."
