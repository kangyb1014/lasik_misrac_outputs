Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap.\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\t    struct linux_device *ldev,\n\t\t\t\t    uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t    struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t    int nents)\n{\n\t(void) lbus;\n\t(void) ldev;\n\t(void) dir;\n\t(void) sg;\n\t(void) nents;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false).

Its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code. Therefore this fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (the unused-parameter cast is a no-op executed operation and is dead code).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) parameter casts are the standard idiom to mark function parameters as intentionally unused (and to suppress compiler warnings). Although the expression-statements have no runtime side effects and removing them would not change execution semantics, their presence communicates intent and affects diagnostics; MISRA-style toolchains typically treat this idiom as acceptable for unused parameters rather than as \u2018dead code\u2019. In short, this construct is used deliberately to suppress warnings and document intent, so it should not be reported as a Rule 2.2 violation in this context."
