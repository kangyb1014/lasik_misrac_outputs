  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statements (e.g. (void) dir;) are expression-statements that are executed but have no effect on program behaviour. According to the quoted MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition \u2014 \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d \u2014 these lines meet that definition and therefore constitute dead code. Agent A\u2019s characterization of '(void) dir;' as an executed no-op whose removal would not affect behaviour is correct. Note: many projects use (void)param; only to suppress compiler warnings; doing so avoids warnings but does not change program behaviour and thus still falls under the rule as dead code. To comply with MISRA 2.2, either provide a meaningful implementation, remove the unused parameters, or mark them with a standardized compiler mechanism/attribute for \u201cunused\u201d parameters rather than leaving executed no-op statements."
