First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of metal_io_block_write.\n```c\nint metal_io_block_write(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       const void *restrict src, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tconst unsigned char *source = src;\n\tint retlen;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_write) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_write)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, src, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\twhile ( len && (\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) ||\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)source % sizeof(int)))) {\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\t\tptr++;\n\t\t\tsource++;\n\t\t\tlen--;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tsource += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = *(const unsigned int *)source;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; ptr++, source++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop uses len as the loop counter in the second clause, but the third clause increments ptr and source in addition to decrementing len. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires only one loop counter and that the third clause may modify only that loop counter. Modifying ptr and source in the iteration expression therefore violates Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause of a for statement to modify only the single loop counter. In the loop\n\nfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n                  source += sizeof(int),\n                  len -= sizeof(int))\n\nthe iteration expression modifies ptr and source in addition to len. That means more than the single loop counter (len) is being modified in the third clause, which violates the rule. (Even though ptr/source are not modified inside the loop body, the rule explicitly requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter.)"
