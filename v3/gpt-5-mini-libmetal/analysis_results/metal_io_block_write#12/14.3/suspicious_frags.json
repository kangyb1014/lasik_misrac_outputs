  "explanation": "I did not mark other expressions because they are clearly non\u2011invariant runtime checks: the null-pointer test (if (!ptr)), the bounds adjustment (if ((offset + len) > io->size) ...), the block_write selection (if (io->ops.block_write)), and the return/atomic fence statements do not have controlling expressions that are constant. There are no do-while constructs in the function. The three loop headers listed above are the only controlling expressions in iteration statements and therefore are the relevant fragments to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
