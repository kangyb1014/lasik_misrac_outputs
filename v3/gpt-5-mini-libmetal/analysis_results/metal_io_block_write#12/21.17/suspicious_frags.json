  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not perform memory copying or pointer arithmetic that could lead to accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Specifically: - The null check (if (!ptr) return -ERANGE;) only verifies the pointer returned by metal_io_virt and does not perform any memory accesses itself. - The atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst); call does not access memory via the pointers and cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses. - The final return (return retlen;) and simple assignments/variable declarations that do not dereference or advance pointers (other than the ones listed) do not present risk for exceeding object bounds. The selected fragments include all places where the function computes or adjusts lengths, calls a block_write callback (which may perform copying), or performs byte/word copies via pointer dereference and arithmetic \u2014 these are the operations that can lead to accesses beyond object bounds and therefore should be investigated."
