  "explanation": "For deciding whether the target function uses compiler language extensions you must know which identifiers and language features are standard vs. provided as compiler-specific extensions. Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- struct metal_io_region: needed to inspect declared field types (size, ops) and any nonstandard attributes or compiler-specific annotations on the structure that would be language extensions.\n\n- type of io->ops (e.g. struct metal_io_ops) and its member block_write prototype: required to see the exact function-pointer signature (parameter types, use of memory-order type, calling convention attributes, or compiler-specific annotations). If the block_write prototype uses nonstandard types or attributes, that would be an extension.\n\n- metal_io_virt (declaration/definition): to confirm its return type and prototype (e.g. whether it is declared with nonstandard attributes or returns a nonstandard pointer type). The target function casts and dereferences that pointer; any nonstandard qualifiers on the function or return type could indicate an extension.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence (declaration/macro): the fence call is central to whether C11 atomics are used. You must see how atomic_thread_fence is provided (standard stdatomic.h symbol versus a compiler builtin/macro extension).\n\n- memory_order_seq_cst (symbol/enum value) and memory_order (enum/type): these are part of the C11 stdatomic API. Their definitions must be inspected to determine if they are the standard C11 declarations or compiler-specific substitutes/extensions.\n\n- uintptr_t (typedef): used in casts to check alignment. uintptr_t is a standard typedef (stdint.h); if absent or replaced by a compiler extension, that is relevant to the MISRA extension check.\n\n- ERANGE (errno macro): used in the return value. ERANGE is standard in errno.h; if it is a nonstandard definition in this codebase that could indicate use of extensions.\n\n- __STDC_VERSION__ (language-standard macro): necessary to determine which C standard the translation unit is compiled under (e.g. C90, C99, C11). This affects whether constructs such as restrict and stdatomic are standard or are compiler extensions.\n\n- __STDC_NO_ATOMICS__ (C11 atomics feature-test macro): indicates whether the implementation provides stdatomic; if atomics are not provided, atomic_thread_fence/memory_order_* may be compiler extensions; this macro helps decide if the atomic usage is standard or an extension.\n\nProviding these symbol definitions/declarations and the relevant feature-test macros lets the next analyst determine whether constructs in metal_io_block_write (restrict, uintptr_t, atomic_thread_fence, memory_order_seq_cst, any function-pointer attributes, etc.) are standard C features or compiler-provided language extensions."
