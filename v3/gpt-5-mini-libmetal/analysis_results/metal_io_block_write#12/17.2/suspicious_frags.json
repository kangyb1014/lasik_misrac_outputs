  "explanation": "Only actual function-call sites can create direct or indirect recursion that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The three call expressions above are the only function calls in the provided function body and thus are the only places that could possibly lead to metal_io_block_write calling itself (directly or indirectly). Other code fragments in the function \u2014 pointer arithmetic (ptr++, source++), casts and dereferences (e.g. *(unsigned char *)ptr, *(const unsigned int *)source), loop constructs (while, for), comparisons and assignments, the bounds check and the return statement \u2014 are not function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion. The constant/macro memory_order_seq_cst and simple arithmetic like (offset + len) or % sizeof(int) are not function calls either. Consequently those non-call constructs do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 compliance."
