  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_allocate:\n```c\nstatic int metal_irq_allocate(int irq_base, int irq_num)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\tint irq_tocheck = irq_base, irq_end_tocheck;\n\n\tif (irq_num == 0) {\n\t\treturn METAL_IRQ_ANY;\n\t}\n\tif (irq_tocheck == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\tirq_tocheck = 0;\n\t}\n\tirq_end_tocheck = irq_tocheck + irq_num;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tint cntr_irq_base, cntr_irq_end;\n\n\t\tcntr = metal_container_of(node,\n\t\t\t\t\t  struct metal_irq_controller, node);\n\t\tcntr_irq_base = cntr->irq_base;\n\t\tcntr_irq_end = cntr_irq_base + cntr->irq_num;\n\t\tif (irq_tocheck < cntr_irq_end &&\n\t\t    irq_end_tocheck > cntr_irq_base) {\n\t\t\tif (irq_base != METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\t\t\t/* IRQ has been allocated */\n\t\t\t\treturn METAL_IRQ_ANY;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tirq_tocheck = cntr_irq_end;\n\t\t\tirq_end_tocheck = irq_tocheck + irq_num;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn irq_tocheck;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (irq_num == 0) {\n\t\treturn METAL_IRQ_ANY;\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The return on irq_num == 0 is reachable and affects behavior. If removed, calls with irq_num == 0 would fall through and return irq_tocheck (irq_base or 0) instead of METAL_IRQ_ANY, changing program behaviour. Therefore this code is not dead."
