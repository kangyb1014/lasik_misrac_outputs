First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only loop-like construct in this function is the metal_list_for_each(...) invocation (a macro that expands to a for loop); that loop and the statements inside it that modify irq_tocheck/irq_end_tocheck are the relevant fragments to inspect for Rule 14.2. No other for/while/do loops appear in the function. Other code fragments (function signature, parameter checks/returns before the loop, local variable declarations, the computations of cntr_irq_base/cntr_irq_end, the metal_container_of call, and the final return) are not loop headers or loop clauses and therefore do not need investigation for this specific for-loop well-formedness rule."
