  "explanation": "All other code constructs in the fragment are standard ISO C: the function signature, use of size_t, pointer types, strcmp, pointer comparisons, function calls, address-of and indirection operators, assignment, if/continue/return, and the error macro usage (-ENOENT) are not compiler language extensions. No inline assembly, __attribute__ usages, typeof, statement-expressions, or other well-known compiler-specific extensions appear elsewhere in the shown code fragment, so they do not require investigation."
