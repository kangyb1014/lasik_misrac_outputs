  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: shows the exact type of the local 'shmem' object and the types of its fields (especially the 'io' field and the 'name' field). You must know whether 'io' is declared const-qualified inside this struct or not.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: shows whether the region object itself or its members are intended to be mutable or const; this determines whether returning a pointer-to-non-const (struct metal_io_region *) is required or whether a const-qualified pointer could/should be used.\n\n- metal_io_region_size (declaration): inspect its parameter type (does it take const struct metal_io_region * or non-const?). If it already takes a const pointer, that is evidence the API treats regions as readable-only. If it requires non-const, that restricts changing result to const.\n\n- metal_shmem_open (declaration/implementation): this function is the direct caller of metal_shmem_open_generic; you must see how it uses the result pointer returned (does it pass the returned region to functions that require non-const struct metal_io_region * or does it treat it read-only?). That usage determines whether the result parameter of metal_shmem_open_generic can reasonably be const-qualified.\n\n- metal_open (declaration) and metal_shmem_try_map (declaration): metal_shmem_open calls these; if they accept struct metal_io_region * (non-const) as arguments or otherwise modify the region, that prevents marking the region pointer const. Their prototypes show whether callers require a mutable region.\n\n- struct metal_list: definition of the list node type used in iteration; needed to confirm the node/member types and whether metal_container_of casts involve const/volatile qualifiers.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro) and metal_container_of (macro): these macros perform pointer arithmetic/casts. You need their definitions to ensure they do not cast away const qualifiers or otherwise hide const-correctness issues (for example by casting through void* or raw pointers), which would affect whether the function violates the MISRA guidance.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets you determine (a) the declared constness of the region object and related APIs, (b) how the returned pointer is consumed by callers, and (c) whether any internal casts/macros remove const qualifiers \u2014 all necessary to decide if metal_shmem_open_generic should/should not use const-qualified pointer types to comply with the MISRA rule."
