  "explanation": "Fragments not listed as suspicious were considered and not included because they already satisfy const-qualification or are non-pointer/scalar members and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. For example, the function parameter 'const char *name' and the field 'const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap' are already const-qualified. Scalar fields such as size, page_shift, page_mask and mem_flags are not pointer targets and therefore outside the scope of the rule. Operations that merely read values (e.g. calls to strcmp or metal_io_region_size) do not create additional pointer qualification concerns. List-iteration and container macros (used to traverse and obtain enclosing structures) often require non-const pointers by design; their usage was reviewed but not flagged here (only the list pointer declarations themselves were included as suspicious for investigation). Other code lines not included either do not involve pointers to be const-qualified or already employ const where appropriate."
