  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d you must know whether any parameters are being modified directly or indirectly by called functions/macros and the types of objects passed. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- clock_gettime (declaration/prototype, including clockid_t and return type): to confirm the second parameter is a pointer (struct timespec *) and to see whether the call semantics could modify any pointer parameter of metal_get_timestamp. It also shows the function does not take/return any alias to metal_get_timestamp parameters (metal_get_timestamp has none).\n\n- struct timespec (definition: members tv_sec, tv_nsec and their types): to verify tp is a local struct (members are scalars, not pointers) and that taking &tp passes a pointer to a local object (allowed to be modified by the callee); ensures no hidden pointer-to-parameter aliasing.\n\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC (macro/constant): to ensure this argument is a simple constant and not a macro that could expand to an expression with side effects that might modify parameters.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/prototype): to check whether metal_log is a function or a macro and whether its prototype could cause modification of any of metal_get_timestamp's parameters (again metal_get_timestamp has none). If metal_log is a macro, its expansion could in theory modify lvalues passed to it; knowing its declaration/definition rules this out.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum/constant): to verify it is a simple constant/enum value (no side-effecting macro) so the call metal_log(...) does not cause modification of any surrounding parameters.\n\n- NS_PER_S (macro/constant): to ensure it is a numeric constant (e.g. 1000000000ULL) and not a macro with side effects or that expands to an expression that might involve or modify parameters.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyst confirm that metal_get_timestamp does not modify any of its own parameters (it has none), and that none of the calls/macros used could implicitly modify parameters in violation of the MISRA rule."
