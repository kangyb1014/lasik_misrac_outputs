  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not introduce pointer usage that would be subject to Rule 8.13: scalar variables (t, r) and arithmetic on tp members are not pointer declarations or pointer parameters. The function return and simple assignments contain no pointer types. Therefore only the declarations/uses involving the timespec object and the log call (which passes a string literal) merit investigation for const-qualification concerns; all other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 8.13."
