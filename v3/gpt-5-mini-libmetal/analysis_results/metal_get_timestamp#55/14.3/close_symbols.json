  "explanation": "clock_gettime \u2014 The controlling expression is if (r == -1) where r is the return value of clock_gettime. You must know the function prototype and run\u2011time semantics (possible return values and whether it can be a compile\u2011time constant/stubbed) to decide if the expression can be invariant.\nCLOCK_MONOTONIC \u2014 Identifies the clock source passed to clock_gettime. The chosen clock affects whether the call can vary at run time (e.g. some stubbed/test builds or platform-specific definitions could make the call behave deterministically); include to inspect any macro redefinition that could make r constant.\nstruct timespec \u2014 Definition of the structure used by clock_gettime; needed to see whether tp is treated/initialized in a way that could make r invariant or affect reachability of the branch (and to verify side effects are not causing invariance analysis to change).\ntp.tv_sec and tp.tv_nsec \u2014 Members read after the controlling expression; include so the analyzer can see whether any of these are macros/aliases or have unusual definitions that could affect clock_gettime behavior or introduce constant propagation that makes the earlier controlling expression effectively invariant.\nNS_PER_S \u2014 Macro used in the time calculation; included so the analyzer can check whether any macro expansions or constant folding could influence the determinism of the function (not directly part of the controlling expression but relevant to overall constant propagation analysis).\nmetal_log \u2014 Called inside the conditional branch. Include to inspect whether this call (or its substitutions) could affect evaluation or be used by static tools to conclude the branch is dead/always taken.\nMETAL_LOG_ERROR \u2014 Logging-level macro used with metal_log; include for the same reason as metal_log (possible macro tricks or build-time redefinitions that could affect reachability/invariance analysis).\n\nNote: The primary symbol required to assess the MISRA rule here is clock_gettime (and its build-time/platform definition). The other symbols are included insofar as they can be redefined or stubbed in builds and thus can influence whether the controlling expression (r == -1) is invariant."
