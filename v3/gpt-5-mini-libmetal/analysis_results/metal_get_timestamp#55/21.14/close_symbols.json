  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_get_timestamp violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any code reachable from metal_get_timestamp that could contain a memcmp-based string comparison. Specifically:\n\n- metal_log: The function called on error. metal_log is the most likely place where a memcmp could be used to compare strings (for formatting, level checks, filtering, etc.). You must examine its implementation.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The logging severity/identifier passed to metal_log; its definition (macro/enum/constant) might expand to code or be used by metal_log in ways that trigger string comparisons. Inspecting the symbol ensures you see any string constants or macros involved in logging.\n- clock_gettime: The standard time function called here. While unlikely to perform string comparisons, its declaration/usage confirms there is no indirect memcmp use inside any wrapper used in this build.\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC: The clock ID macro; include its definition to rule out any unexpected macro expansion that could hide string-comparing code (rare but necessary for completeness).\n- struct timespec: Definition (fields tv_sec, tv_nsec and their types). Verify that no hidden string handling is performed via these fields or associated accessor macros.\n- NS_PER_S: The macro/constant used for the nanosecond conversion. Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not expand to any function calls (including memcmp) or involve string operations.\n- memcmp: The standard library function named by the MISRA rule. You need its declaration/implementation (or any project override) to detect direct uses and to check how it is invoked (parameters and length argument) to decide whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- transitive callees of metal_log (all functions called, directly or indirectly, by metal_log): Any function called by metal_log could contain memcmp usage. To be sure the target does not indirectly cause a memcmp-based null-terminated string comparison you must inspect the full call tree rooted at metal_log.\n\nIn short: inspect metal_log and everything it calls (and the memcmp symbol/overrides), plus the small set of macros/types used by metal_get_timestamp (NS_PER_S, struct timespec, CLOCK_MONOTONIC, METAL_LOG_ERROR) to rule out any hidden memcmp string comparisons triggered by this function."
