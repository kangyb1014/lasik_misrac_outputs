  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C (for-loop well-formed) analysis of metal_get_timestamp:\n\n- clock_gettime\n  - metal_get_timestamp calls clock_gettime. MISRA rule states that the behaviour of a for-loop body includes behaviour of any functions called within that statement. To determine if any for-loops (and whether they are well-formed) could affect or be affected by this function, you must inspect the body/implementation of clock_gettime for any for-loops and their use/modification of objects that might interact with this function (for example, global loop counters or objects passed by pointer). Also needed to see whether clock_gettime modifies objects that could act as loop counters elsewhere.\n\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC\n  - This macro/enum is passed to clock_gettime. Although unlikely to contain a for-loop itself, macros can expand to complex expressions; include it to ensure no unexpected macro expansion introduces loop constructs or side effects relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- struct timespec (definition: tv_sec, tv_nsec)\n  - The function reads tp.tv_sec and tp.tv_nsec. To reason about whether these objects could be involved in or modified by for-loops (directly or via called functions), you need the type definition (member types and any associated semantics). Also, since tp is written by clock_gettime via pointer, you must confirm whether any called code might treat these members as loop counters or otherwise interact with them.\n\n- time_t (definition)\n  - tv_sec is typically of type time_t. Knowing time_t (signed/unsigned, width) is necessary to reason about the arithmetic t = tp.tv_sec * (NS_PER_S) and whether that arithmetic could interact with loop counters or produce side effects relevant to MISRA loop rules (e.g., if macros or inline functions are used in conversion).\n\n- metal_log\n  - Called when clock_gettime fails. metal_log\u2019s implementation must be inspected because it may contain for-loops whose behavior (loop counters, side effects, or modification of objects used elsewhere) could violate the MISRA for-loop rule as applied transitively to calls made from metal_get_timestamp.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR\n  - The log-level token passed to metal_log; it may be a macro or enum. If it is a macro that expands to code, it could introduce side effects or loop constructs. At minimum include its definition to ensure no hidden expansions affect loop analysis.\n\n- NS_PER_S\n  - This constant/macro is used in the arithmetic. Macros can expand to expressions or inline functions; include its definition to verify it does not contain loop constructs or side effects that would be relevant to MISRA for-loop rules.\n\nNotes/assumptions:\n- metal_get_timestamp itself contains no for-loop; the primary reason to collect the above symbols is to inspect any called routines or macro expansions that could contain for-loops or side effects that interact with loop counters per the MISRA rule (the rule treats called functions as part of the loop body). If the static call graph shows additional callees (transitively) from clock_gettime or metal_log, include their definitions/bodies as well for complete analysis.\n- Standard library declarations (prototypes) are not sufficient for MISRA for-loop checks \u2014 the implementations (bodies) and macro expansions are required when they may contain for-loops or modify objects relevant to loop counters."
