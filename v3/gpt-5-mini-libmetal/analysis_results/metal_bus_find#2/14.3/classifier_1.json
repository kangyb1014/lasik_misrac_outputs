  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression depends on strcmp(bus->name, name), and 'bus' changes as the list is iterated, so the condition is not invariant. (A hypothetical violation would occur only if every iteration produced the same strcmp result and 'result' were fixed such that the whole expression is always true or always false \u2014 e.g. every bus->name equals name and result is non-NULL, making the condition permanently true.)"
