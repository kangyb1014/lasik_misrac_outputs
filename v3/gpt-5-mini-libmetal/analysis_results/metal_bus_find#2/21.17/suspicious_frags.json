  "explanation": "No other code fragments call or use the <string.h> string-handling functions, so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17. The metal_list_for_each loop and metal_container_of call only traverse container structures and do not perform string operations. The assignment '*result = bus;' and the return statements do not involve string.h functions or buffer accesses and therefore do not need investigation under this rule. Only the strcmp usage (and its operands) can potentially cause accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by the pointer parameters, so it is the only fragment that requires further inspection."
