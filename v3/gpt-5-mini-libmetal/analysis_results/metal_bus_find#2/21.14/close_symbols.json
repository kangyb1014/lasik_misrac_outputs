  "explanation": "- strcmp: The target function calls strcmp. To decide if the code violates the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings we must inspect the actual strcmp symbol used in this build (declaration/definition). If strcmp is a wrapper that ultimately uses memcmp (or is macro-redirected), that would trigger the MISRA concern.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically mentions memcmp. To determine a violation we need to see whether memcmp is used directly or indirectly (e.g., inside strcmp). Inspecting memcmp implementation or references lets us detect such indirect use.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition, including the 'name' member): We must know the exact type and semantics of bus->name (e.g., char array vs pointer, guarantees of null-termination). If bus->name is not a null-terminated C string, using strcmp (or memcmp) may be inappropriate or the MISRA rule may not apply; conversely, if it is guaranteed NUL-terminated, strcmp is the correct API.\n\n- metal_bus_register: This function is a caller/creator that likely initializes metal_bus instances and their name fields. To determine whether bus->name is NUL-terminated (or set by assigning a raw buffer compared with memcmp), we must inspect how names are allocated/initialized here.\n\n- metal_device_open and metal_linux_bus_finish: These callers may pass the 'name' argument into metal_bus_find. To determine whether the 'name' parameter passed into strcmp is a null-terminated string (or could be a raw buffer), their code must be examined.\n\n- string.h / header that defines/overrides strcmp (any macro or inline implementation): Some codebases replace standard functions with macros or inline implementations. To be certain strcmp is the standard string comparison (not a macro that maps to memcmp or another forbidden construct) we must inspect the header or compile-time overrides.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine (1) whether the compared operands are null-terminated strings and (2) whether strcmp is implemented in terms of memcmp or otherwise violates the MISRA prohibition."
