Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each: The for loop in the source is a macro; to determine whether the loop is well-formed you must see the exact expansion to know the three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) and which identifiers are used as the loop counter and head.\\n- metal_container_of: This macro is invoked inside the loop to derive 'bus' from 'node'. You must verify it has no side effects that would constitute modification of the loop counter or other objects used in the loop clauses.\\n- struct metal_list (definition: members including next/prev): Typical list-for-each macros iterate by following a next pointer (e.g. node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next). You need the struct field names and semantics (which member is the link) to confirm which object is the loop counter and that only that counter is modified in the iteration clause.\\n- struct metal_bus (definition: members 'name' and 'node'): The loop body accesses bus->name and uses the 'node' member as the list link (used by metal_container_of). Knowing these members confirms whether objects referenced in the loop clauses are distinct from objects modified in the body.\\n- _metal (global) and definition of struct that contains common.bus_list: The head argument passed to the macro is &_metal.common.bus_list. You must know the type and identity of that head object to check that the second clause (the loop condition) uses only allowed objects and that those objects are not modified by the loop body or called functions.\\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): The MISRA rule counts the behaviour of functions called inside the loop body. You need the prototype/semantics of strcmp to show it has no persistent side effects (it only reads memory) so it does not violate the prohibition on modifying objects used in the loop condition or counter.\\nThese symbols together allow expanding the for-macro, identifying the loop counter and head, checking that only the loop counter is modified by the iteration clause, and verifying that no called function or macro in the body modifies the loop counter or other objects used in the loop condition."
