  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'name' is already const-qualified and is only used in read-only operations (strcmp), control-flow and return statements do not involve pointer-to-object qualifications, and there are no other pointer declarations or pointer assignments in the function aside from the fragments listed above. Therefore only the listed pointer-related declarations and assignments potentially need review for whether they should point to const-qualified types."
