  "explanation": "All other code in the function uses standard ISO C constructs (function definition, struct and pointer declarations, strcmp, if, assignment, return). None of those are compiler-specific language extensions. The only items that can conceal compiler extensions in this snippet are the two macros above: their definitions (not shown here) commonly use compiler-specific features (e.g., typeof, statement-expressions, or gcc attributes). Therefore those macro usages are the only fragments that need investigation; the visible plain C code does not indicate any language extension usage."
