  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided code are statically unreachable. Reasoning:\n\n- The function metal_bus_find contains a single loop driven by metal_list_for_each. That loop may iterate zero or more times depending on the list contents; zero iterations is not the same as unreachable code \u2014 it is dynamic behavior based on data.\n- The only return inside the loop is guarded by the runtime condition (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result). Both the strcmp and the result check are evaluated at runtime, so the return is reachable when those conditions hold. There is no code following that return that would be unreachable.\n- The final return -ENOENT is reachable whenever the loop finishes without an early return (including the case of an empty list).\n- The supporting macros/structs (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of, struct definitions) do not introduce any statically unreachable statements in the shown expansions; they only affect runtime pointer computations and the iteration behavior.\n\nGiven the above, there are no obvious dead/unreachable code fragments in the supplied code that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If additional code (not shown) modifies the macros or inserts unconditional returns/labels outside these snippets, those would need separate review, but nothing in the provided snippets is statically unreachable."
