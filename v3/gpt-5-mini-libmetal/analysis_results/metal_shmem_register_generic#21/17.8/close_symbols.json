  "explanation": "To determine whether the function modifies its pointer parameter (shmem) you must know whether any expression or called macro/function can reassign the pointer variable itself vs. only modify the object it points to. Specifically:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (full definition): shows all member types so you can tell whether accesses (->name, ->io, ->node) refer to embedded members (modifying the pointed-to object, allowed) or to pointer members (different implications).\n- definition of the field 'name': confirms type (char * or array) so that reading strlen(shmem->name) cannot reassign 'shmem' and clarifies whether shmem->name is a pointer member or an array member.\n- definition of the field 'io' and nested 'ops' including 'close': ensures that evaluating shmem->io.ops.close is only a read of a function pointer member and not a macro or operator that could modify 'shmem'.\n- definition/type of the field 'node' (list-node type): needed because &shmem->node is passed to metal_list_add_tail \u2014 you must know whether node is an embedded struct member (modifying that member modifies the object pointed to, which is allowed) or if it is a pointer-to-node that might lead to reassigning pointer storage in an unexpected way.\n- declaration/definition of _metal and its type (common.generic_shmem_list): to understand what is being passed as the first argument to metal_list_add_tail and whether that call might expand to code that could modify the local parameter 'shmem'.\n- prototype/definition (or macro body) of metal_list_add_tail: critical to see whether this macro/function could modify the pointer parameter 'shmem' (for example, if implemented as a macro that re-evaluates its arguments in a way that assigns through them). You must inspect its implementation to ensure it only mutates the list/node objects, not the local pointer variable.\n- definition of the metal_assert macro/function: macros can contain surprising code; confirm that evaluating metal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(...)) cannot assign to 'shmem' or otherwise change the pointer parameter.\n- prototype of strlen: included to be thorough (to confirm it's a normal library function that does not modify its pointer argument nor the pointer variable 'shmem').\n\nWith these symbols you can inspect all member accesses, macro expansions and callees to prove that 'shmem' (the pointer parameter itself) is never assigned to inside metal_shmem_register_generic and therefore whether the MISRA rule is respected."
