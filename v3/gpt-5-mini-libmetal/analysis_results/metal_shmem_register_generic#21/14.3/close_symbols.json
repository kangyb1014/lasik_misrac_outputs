  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for the MISRA C rule check (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- metal_assert (macro/definition): metal_assert is used with the two controlling expressions. The macro body determines whether those expressions become control statements (for example an if, while, or a call) or are compiled out; the exact expansion is needed to decide if an invariant expression appears in a controlling construct and so would violate MISRA.\n\n- NDEBUG or other macros that control metal_assert expansion: Many assert macros are disabled by build macros (e.g. NDEBUG). Whether the assertions are present in the compiled code changes whether the controlling expressions exist at all; this affects the MISRA analysis.\n\n- strlen (declaration/semantics): The expression strlen(shmem->name) != 0 is a controlling sub\u2011expression. Knowing strlen\u2019s semantics (it computes length at run time, not a compile\u2011time constant) is necessary to judge whether that expression can be invariant. Also if a special implementation or compile\u2011time intrinsics are used, that can affect constness.\n\n- definition of struct metal_generic_shmem (full layout: member types for name, node, io): To decide whether shmem->name and shmem->io are capable of being compile\u2011time constants (or always non\u2011NULL/empty), you must know the exact types of these members (e.g. char * vs char[], const qualifiers). This informs whether the controlling expressions (shmem->name and strlen(shmem->name) != 0) can be invariant.\n\n- definition of the io ops structure (type of shmem->io.ops and the 'close' member): The test !shmem->io.ops.close inspects a function pointer/member. You need the ops struct definition and the type of close to determine if close is a pointer that can be statically initialized to NULL (making the expression invariant), or if other semantics apply.\n\n- any static/global initializers of struct metal_generic_shmem objects (compile\u2011time initializers): If there exist statically declared/initialized metal_generic_shmem instances (common for \"statically registered\" regions), their initializers show whether name and ops.close are compile\u2011time constants (e.g. name set to a literal or close set to NULL). Those initial values are necessary to determine whether the controlling expressions in this function will be invariant in typical use and thus violate MISRA."
