  "explanation": "No other code fragments call any of the <string.h> functions listed in Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The remaining lines only perform pointer/member accesses, an assertion macro alias, and a list insertion; none invoke those string functions or pass string pointers to them. Therefore only the shown strlen usage needs investigation for potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds access per Rule 21.17."
