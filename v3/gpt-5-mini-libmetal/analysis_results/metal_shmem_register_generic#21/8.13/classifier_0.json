  "scenario": "If struct metal_generic_shmem declares name as a non-const pointer (e.g. \"char *name;\"), this fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer is only used for read-only access (strlen) and therefore should be declared as a pointer to const (\"const char *name;\"). If, however, name is already declared as \"const char *\", there is no violation."
