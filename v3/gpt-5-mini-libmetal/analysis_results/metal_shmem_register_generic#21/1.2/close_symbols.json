  "explanation": "For diagnosing language\u2011extension usage you must inspect any macros, inline helpers and types that the target function references, because extensions are commonly hidden there. Specifically:\n- metal_assert: often a macro; it may expand to compiler extensions (GCC statement expressions, typeof, __extension__, asm or attributes). You must see its definition to determine if the target function relies on an extension.\n- metal_list_add_tail: may be a macro (not necessarily a simple function). Macro implementations can use statement expressions, typeof, or other compiler extensions. Its definition is needed to check for extensions.\n- strlen: standard library function, but compilers sometimes provide builtins or macros. Include its declaration/definition context to verify no non\u2011standard builtin/macro extension is used.\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (full definition): to check for use of anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, extension bitfields, nonstandard member attributes or other type extensions that would make member access an extension.\n- definition of shmem->io and shmem->io.ops types (including close member): to verify whether 'io' or 'ops' are implemented with anonymous unions/structs, function\u2011like macros, or other extensions and to confirm 'close' usage is a plain pointer/member access.\n- definition of shmem->node type: to ensure taking &shmem->node is valid and not relying on a compiler extension (e.g., zero\u2011length arrays, flexible array misuse, or special packing attributes).\n- _metal (global) and its type, including .common.generic_shmem_list and its type: the expression &_metal.common.generic_shmem_list must be checked for use of any extension in the declaration of _metal or its nested types (anonymous structs/unions, nonstandard attributes, macros hiding members).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyzer see whether any identifiers used in the target function expand to or depend on compiler language extensions."
