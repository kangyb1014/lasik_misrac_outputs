  "explanation": "I examined the function for all pointer declarations, pointer-producing calls, pointer casts, and pointer uses. The listed fragments cover: the function pointer parameter, the pointer returned by metal_io_virt, the call through the ops function pointer, and every location where the code casts or dereferences a pointer. Other lines in the function are scalar declarations/assignments, bounds checks, loop control, arithmetic, or an atomic fence and do not introduce additional pointer types or pointer casts that could be qualified with const for the purposes of MISRA C Rule 8.13, so they do not need further investigation for this rule."
