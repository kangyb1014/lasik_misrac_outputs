  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_io_block_set participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect all symbols that could form a call cycle back to it: \n\n- metal_io_virt: metal_io_block_set directly calls this; inspect its implementation to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_io_block_set. \n\n- metal_io_block_read, metal_io_block_write, shmem_child: these are listed callers of metal_io_virt in the static call graph. If any of these (or functions they call) call metal_io_block_set, a cycle could exist; include their implementations to follow the call chain. \n\n- struct metal_io_region (definition): metal_io_block_set accesses io->ops; you must know the layout to find the block_set pointer and where it originates. \n\n- struct metal_io_ops / declaration of io->ops.block_set: you need the exact function-pointer member type and name so you can identify all possible target functions assigned to block_set. \n\n- all functions assigned to metal_io_ops.block_set (block_set implementations): io->ops.block_set, when non-NULL, is invoked from metal_io_block_set. Any implementation assigned here could call metal_io_block_set (indirect recursion). You must analyze every such implementation. \n\n- all sites/functions that initialize or assign io->ops (initializers): to locate which concrete functions are put into block_set you must inspect the code that constructs/assigns metal_io_ops instances. This reveals the actual call targets. \n\n- all callers of metal_io_block_set in the code base: to ensure there is no indirect recursion where another function calls metal_io_block_set and then (through some chain) returns to it, you must examine every place that calls metal_io_block_set.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let you build the complete call graph (including function-pointer targets) needed to prove the absence or presence of direct/indirect self-calls per the MISRA rule."
