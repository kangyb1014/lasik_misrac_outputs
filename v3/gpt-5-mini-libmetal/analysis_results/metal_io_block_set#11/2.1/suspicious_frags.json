  "explanation": "The following parts of the function were not included in the suspicious list and do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code):\n\n- The function entry and parameter initializations (unsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(...); int retlen = len;). These are normal initializations and are executed on every call.\n\n- The null-pointer check and early return (if (!ptr) return -ERANGE;). This is an explicit runtime check that can legitimately return early; code after it is reachable when ptr is non-NULL.\n\n- The bounds adjustment (if ((offset + len) > io->size) len = io->size - offset; retlen = len;). This is a runtime conditional that may or may not execute depending on inputs and is not statically unreachable.\n\n- The call path when io->ops.block_set is non-NULL (if (io->ops.block_set) { (*io->ops.block_set)(...); }). That branch is a valid runtime alternative to the manual memory-set implementation and is reachable whenever the function pointer is set; it is not statically unreachable.\n\n- The final return (return retlen;). This return is reachable from both branches and the explicit early-return case and therefore is not unreachable.\n\n- The individual byte-wise assignments (casts to unsigned char and pointer increments) are controlled by runtime conditions (len, pointer alignment) and therefore are not statically unreachable in general.\n\nThe suspicious fragments listed are those constructs that can become statically or platform-conditionally unreachable (for example when sizeof(int) == 1 or when a function pointer is always non-NULL in the project) and therefore merit investigation for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.1."
