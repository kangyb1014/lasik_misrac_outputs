First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop's third clause is 'ptr++, len--', which modifies two objects. The loop condition uses 'len' as the loop counter, so the third clause must modify only that loop counter and there must be only one loop counter. Modifying 'ptr' in the third clause (and thus having two loop-control updates) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_io_block_set:\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Several for-loops in the else branch violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. For example:\n- for (; len && ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)); ptr++, len--)\n- for (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int), len -= sizeof(int))\n- for (; len != 0; ptr++, len--)\n\nEach of these uses len as the loop counter but the third clause modifies both len and ptr. Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and that only one loop counter exists; additionally the second clause must not depend on objects (such as ptr) that are modified in the loop body. The loops therefore violate clauses 2\u20134 of Rule 14.2. (The first small loop setting cint is fine.)"
