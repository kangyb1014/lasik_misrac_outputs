  "explanation": "To determine whether 'mutex' participates in direct or indirect recursion, the analyzer must examine every function it calls and their transitive callees and any callback/thread entry points invoked on its behalf. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_run: Direct callee of mutex that spawns/dispatches work; any call chain originating here could lead back to mutex (indirect recursion).\n- mutex_thread: The thread/callback function passed into metal_run; threads started by metal_run may execute this function and it could call mutex (indirect recursion).\n- metal_run_noblock: A direct callee of metal_run (per the call graph). If it (or its callees) call mutex, that would create an indirect recursion path.\n- metal_finish_threads: Another direct callee of metal_run. Its implementation (or its callees) might call mutex and produce an indirect recursion.\n- metal_mutex_init: Direct callee of mutex; although its call graph shows no callees, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call mutex.\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Direct callee of mutex; likewise must be checked for any call path back to mutex.\n\nIn short, you must inspect these functions (and their transitive callees) to prove there is no path from any of them back to 'mutex', which is necessary to verify compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls."
