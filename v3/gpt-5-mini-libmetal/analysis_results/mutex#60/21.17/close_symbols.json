This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "metal_mutex_t: type/layout of the mutex object is needed to determine whether any string.h-style operations (memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp-type uses) inside callees might treat the mutex object as a buffer and access beyond its bounds.\nmetal_mutex_init: called directly by mutex; its implementation must be inspected to see whether it calls any string.h functions (memset/memcpy/etc.) on the mutex object or other buffers supplied from mutex.\nmetal_mutex_deinit: called directly by mutex; inspect for use of string.h functions that might access buffers provided by mutex or other globals.\nmetal_run: the main callee that spawns/controls threads; it receives the &lock pointer and may copy or otherwise manipulate that or other buffers using string.h functions \u2014 its body must be checked for any potentially out-of-bounds accesses.\nmetal_run_noblock: a direct callee of metal_run; string.h violations might occur here as part of metal_run\u2019s implementation path, so it must be examined.\nmetal_finish_threads: another callee reachable from metal_run; it may perform finalization that uses string.h functions on per-thread or shared buffers \u2014 inspect to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses.\nmutex_thread: the thread function passed to metal_run; it receives the &lock argument and any string.h usage inside this thread routine could access the pointed object or other buffers incorrectly, so its code is required to determine compliance with the rule."
