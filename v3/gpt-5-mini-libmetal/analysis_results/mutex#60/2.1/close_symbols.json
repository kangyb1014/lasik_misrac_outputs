  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in mutex() are unreachable you must know whether the called functions or types can prevent control from reaching the following statements (e.g. by never returning, calling exit/abort/longjmp, or being annotated noreturn). For each symbol: \n\n- metal_run: Primary callee in mutex(). If metal_run never returns (infinite loop, calls exit/abort/longjmp, or is declared noreturn) then the calls after it (metal_mutex_deinit and the return) are unreachable. You need its declaration and implementation/semantics.\n\n- metal_run_noblock: A direct callee of metal_run. Its behavior can make metal_run non-returning (or change its control flow); analyse it to determine whether metal_run can return to mutex().\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Another callee of metal_run. Its implementation may contain termination or blocking behavior that affects whether metal_run returns.\n\n- mutex_thread: The thread-start function passed to metal_run. Its code may call exit/abort/longjmp or otherwise terminate the process or change global control flow, which would affect whether code after metal_run executes; inspect it to determine possible non-returning side-effects.\n\n- metal_mutex_init: Although simple init often returns, it could be implemented to not return or to longjmp/abort on failure; inspect its implementation/attributes to ensure the first call cannot make later code unreachable.\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Needed to check for side effects or attributes that could affect reachability analysis of the return statement (for completeness and to confirm that deinit is reachable and/or has no noreturn behavior).\n\n- metal_mutex_t: Type definition is required to confirm that taking &lock and passing it to init/run/deinit does not involve unusual semantics (e.g. overloaded macros, weird compound literal expansions) that could alter control flow or be expanded into non-returning constructs.\n\nCollecting these symbols (declarations and implementations, including any attributes like noreturn) is sufficient to determine whether any statements in mutex() are provably unreachable under MISRA C's unreachable-code rule."
