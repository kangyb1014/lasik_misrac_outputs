  "explanation": "- mutex_thread: This is the thread entry function passed to metal_run; it may contain loops or conditional controlling expressions (while/for/do-while/switch) that could be invariant. To determine compliance you must inspect its controlling expressions.\n- metal_run: Direct callee of mutex; it orchestrates thread creation/joining and likely contains loops or conditionals that depend on the threads argument. Its controlling expressions must be checked for invariance or allowed exceptions.\n- metal_run_noblock: A direct callee of metal_run. Any loops or conditionals here can affect overall behavior; they must be inspected for invariant controlling expressions.\n- metal_finish_threads: Another callee of metal_run; it may contain synchronization loops (spin/wait) whose controlling expressions need examination for invariance or permitted infinite-loop usage.\n- metal_mutex_init: Called by mutex; although less likely, its implementation may include loops/conditionals with invariant expressions that affect compliance and must be checked.\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Same rationale as metal_mutex_init \u2014 its body may contain controlling expressions that need inspection.\n- metal_mutex_t: The mutex type (and any associated macros) can affect how mutex operations are implemented (inline helpers, macros, or constants). You need the type and related definitions to fully analyze any controlling expressions used in mutex-related code.\n\nThese symbols form the reachable callee set from mutex that can contain controlling expressions; each must be inspected to determine whether any controlling expression is invariant (and whether any such invariant is permitted by the stated exceptions)."
