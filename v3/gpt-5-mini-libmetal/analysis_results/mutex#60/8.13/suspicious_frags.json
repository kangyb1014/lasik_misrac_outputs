  "explanation": "Only pointer usages in this snippet are passing &lock to API functions. Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer parameters should point to const-qualified types; therefore each call that takes &lock should be investigated to see whether the callee mutates the mutex or could accept a pointer-to-const. Other fragments do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified: the local declarations (metal_mutex_t lock;, const int threads = 10;, int rc;) are simple object declarations and the use of threads and rc are values, not pointer parameters. The function pointer mutex_thread and the prototypes/definitions of metal_mutex_init, metal_run, metal_mutex_deinit are not present in this snippet and thus cannot be further analyzed here\u2014only the call sites passing &lock are relevant and have been reported."
