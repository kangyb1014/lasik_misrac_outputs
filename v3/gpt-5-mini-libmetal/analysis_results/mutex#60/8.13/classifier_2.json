  "scenario": "No violation. The call metal_mutex_init(&lock) passes the address of a non-const mutex to an init function which is expected to modify the mutex object. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be to const-qualified types only when the pointee is not modified. If metal_mutex_init is declared to take metal_mutex_t * and initializes/modifies the mutex, the pointer must not be const and this call is correct. (If the actual prototype took a pointer-to-const or if the function does not modify the object, the prototype should be changed to use const \u2014 but that is not indicated by the fragment.)"
