  ],
  "explanation": "The function metal_linux_bus_finish has no parameters itself, so there is no direct parameter modification within this function. Local declarations (struct linux_bus *lbus; struct metal_bus *bus;), the for_each_linux_bus(lbus) loop construct, and the general control flow in this function do not involve function parameters and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.8. Only calls to external functions (the two fragments listed) can involve parameter modification inside those callees and hence are the relevant fragments to investigate."
