There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "for_each_linux_bus (macro): The for loop in the target is written as for_each_linux_bus(lbus). The macro expansion defines the three clauses of the for loop (initialisation, condition, iteration). You must inspect the macro to determine the actual loop counter, the second-clause expression, and what objects appear there (to check MISRA clause 1\u20133 and whether the second/third clauses have side effects).\n\nstruct linux_bus (definition: fields used by iterator and 'bus_name'): The iterator variable lbus is of this type. You need its layout to know which member(s) the iterator/macro uses (e.g. next pointer or embedded list node) and to confirm that accessing lbus->bus_name in the loop body does not modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop condition.\n\nlinux_buses (global list/head used by iterator macro, if any): Many iterator macros reference a global list head. If the second clause uses this head or compares against it, you must know that symbol to determine whether the loop condition uses objects that may be modified by the loop body.\n\nstruct list-node type / struct metal_list or list_head (definition used by linux_bus and metal_bus): The iterator and unregister/list deletion functions typically operate on a list node type. Knowing its fields (next/prev) is necessary to check whether the loop counter or the object tested in the condition is modified by functions called in the body.\n\nstruct metal_bus (definition: fields used by unregister, e.g. list node): metal_bus_unregister takes a metal_bus *; inspect its fields to see what metal_bus_unregister modifies (for example its list node) and whether those modifications affect the iterator\u2019s loop counter or the objects used in the loop condition.\n\nmetal_bus_find (function definition): Called in the loop body. MISRA requires that functions called in the loop body be considered part of the loop behaviour. You must inspect metal_bus_find for any persistent side effects (modifying the iterator, loop counter, or objects used in the second/third clause) and to confirm its return semantics (it is used in the if condition).\n\nmetal_bus_unregister (function definition): Called in the loop body when metal_bus_find returns 0. This is the most likely source of modifications to the data structures used by the iterator (removing entries from the bus list). You must inspect its implementation to see whether it modifies the loop counter or any object used in the loop\u2019s condition.\n\nmetal_list_del (function definition): From the static call graph metal_bus_unregister calls metal_list_del. metal_list_del typically removes a node from a linked list; inspecting it tells you what internal pointers it changes and whether those changes affect the iterator\u2019s loop counter/condition.  \n\n(These symbols together let you expand the macro, see exactly what the three for clauses evaluate, and determine whether any object used in the condition or the loop counter is modified by the loop body or by functions called from the body, as required by the MISRA rule.)"
