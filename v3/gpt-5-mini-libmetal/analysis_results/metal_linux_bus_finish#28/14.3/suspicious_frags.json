  "suspicious_frags": [
    "for_each_linux_bus(lbus) {\n\t\tif (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)\n\t\t\tmetal_bus_unregister(bus);\n\t}"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are the loop controlled by the for_each_linux_bus macro and the if condition. The if condition (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0) depends on the runtime value of lbus->bus_name and the result of metal_bus_find, so it is not invariant and does not need investigation for Rule 14.3. There are no other loop or conditional controlling expressions in this function. The declarations of lbus and bus are not controlling expressions. The for_each_linux_bus construct is a macro whose expansion may contain an invariant controlling expression (or an intentional infinite loop); its expansion should be inspected to verify compliance with Rule 14.3 and applicable exceptions, so the loop block above is reported for investigation."
