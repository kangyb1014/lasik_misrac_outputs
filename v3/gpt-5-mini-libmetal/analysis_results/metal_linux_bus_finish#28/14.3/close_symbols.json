  "explanation": "for_each_linux_bus (macro/definition and expansion): The loop in the target function uses this macro as the loop construct. To decide if the loop's controlling expression is invariant (or intentionally infinite), we must see the exact expansion (for/while/do-while), what the loop condition is, and which variables it reads or updates. The macro expansion also shows whether the loop relies on mutation by body code (e.g. removal during iteration) or is an infinite/constant loop allowed by MISRA exception.\n\nstruct linux_bus (definition, including member bus_name): The loop iterates a variable of this type (lbus). The type tells us what bus_name is (its type/constness) and whether any fields used in the loop condition are mutable. If bus_name is a constant or the struct is immutable, that could make expressions invariant; also the definition shows how nodes are linked if the macro relies on struct members for iteration.\n\nlist head symbol(s) referenced by for_each_linux_bus (the container being iterated): The macro typically references a global/list head (the collection of linux_bus instances). Knowing that symbol (and whether it is modified elsewhere) is needed to determine if the loop condition can change across iterations or is fixed.\n\nmetal_bus_find (full prototype/implementation/semantics): The if controlling expression calls metal_bus_find(... ) == 0. To know if that expression is invariant we must know whether metal_bus_find depends on its bus_name argument, has side effects, or always returns a constant value in this context. Its implementation/contract determines whether the if expression can vary across iterations.\n\nstruct metal_bus (definition): The output parameter &bus and any relationship between metal_bus and linux_bus (e.g., same underlying objects) may affect whether later calls (unregister) change the collection being iterated. Knowing the structure helps reason about aliasing and side-effects.\n\nmetal_bus_unregister (implementation): This function is called inside the loop body and may modify the collection iterated by for_each_linux_bus (remove entries). If unregister modifies the data used by the loop condition, the controlling expression may not be invariant; conversely, if unregister cannot affect the loop-driving data, that matters for MISRA analysis.\n\nmetal_list_del (implementation called by metal_bus_unregister): unregister calls this helper to remove nodes from lists. Its implementation shows whether it mutates the list anchors or iteration pointers in a way that would affect the loop condition or make the loop control invariant/variant. Understanding list removal semantics is necessary to see if the loop condition can change as expected."
