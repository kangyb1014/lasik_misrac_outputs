  "explanation": "To determine if metal_linux_bus_finish violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must examine any code that might invoke memcmp on the bus name strings or pass those strings to other routines that do. \n\n- metal_bus_find: Called directly from metal_linux_bus_finish; must be inspected to see if it compares lbus->bus_name (or related fields) using memcmp. Even if the call-return is used only as a boolean, the internals may violate the rule.\n- metal_bus_unregister: Called when metal_bus_find returns success; inspect its implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp on null-terminated name fields (or call other routines that do).\n- metal_list_del: Called by metal_bus_unregister (per call graph); include to check deeper uses of memcmp originating from unregister operations.\n- memcmp: The standard-library function at issue \u2014 include its declaration/usages so the analyzer can detect direct calls and confirm whether the arguments represent null-terminated strings (length, pointers).\n- struct linux_bus: Required to know the type and semantics of lbus->bus_name (e.g., char *, char array, explicit length), to determine whether bus_name is a null-terminated string and therefore whether using memcmp on it would violate MISRA.\n- struct metal_bus: Required to inspect members (e.g., name fields) that are passed between these functions; needed to see whether any fields are null-terminated strings that could be compared with memcmp.\n- for_each_linux_bus: The iteration macro/definition may reference or compute the bus_name or related data; include it to ensure the loop does not transform bus_name into a non-null-terminated buffer or otherwise affect whether memcmp would be applied to a NUL-terminated string.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent locate all call sites of memcmp related to the bus name strings and determine whether memcmp is being (mis)used to compare null-terminated strings in the target function's dynamic call chain."
