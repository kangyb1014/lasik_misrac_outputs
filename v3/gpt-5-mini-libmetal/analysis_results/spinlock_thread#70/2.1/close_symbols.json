  "explanation": "spinlock_test_count: The for-loop condition i < spinlock_test_count determines whether the loop body is ever entered. To decide if the loop body is unreachable (i.e. never executed) the analyser needs the definition, type and possible values (compile-time constants, initialisation) of spinlock_test_count.\n\ntotal: The increment total++ is the main effect inside the loop. Knowing the declaration and linkage of total (global, volatile, etc.) is required to determine whether those statements are meaningful or optimized away and to reason about reachability of side-effecting statements.\n\nmetal_spinlock_acquire: Although already listed as a callee, the function's declaration/prototype and attributes must be examined to determine whether it can return normally. If it is declared with attributes like noreturn, or its implementation never returns (infinite loop, abort/exit), then code after the call (total++ and release) would be unreachable. The analyser needs the full declaration/definition to judge that.\n\nmetal_spinlock_release: Similarly, its declaration/attributes and implementation are needed to determine whether calls to it are reachable/executable and whether it might affect control flow making subsequent code unreachable.\n\ncallers of spinlock_thread (e.g. pthread_create or other thread-creation/registration sites): A static function with no callers is itself unreachable. To decide whether the entire function is unreachable the analyser must find any places where spinlock_thread's address is taken or it is passed to thread-creation APIs (pthread_create or project-specific wrappers) or otherwise referenced. Provide the symbols/locations that call or register spinlock_thread so the analyser can determine if the function can ever be invoked."
