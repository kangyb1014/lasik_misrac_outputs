  "scenario": "No violation: spinlock_thread calls metal_spinlock_acquire, which is a different function. There is no evidence in the provided code that metal_spinlock_acquire calls spinlock_thread (directly or indirectly). A Rule 17.2 violation would only occur if metal_spinlock_acquire (or a chain of calls it makes) called spinlock_thread back, creating recursion."
