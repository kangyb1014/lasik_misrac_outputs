  "explanation": "To determine whether spinlock_thread participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the code it calls and anything those callees call. Concretely: \n- metal_spinlock_acquire and metal_spinlock_release implementations: needed to see whether they call (directly) back to spinlock_thread or to other functions that might. \n- Any transitive callees of those two functions: indirect recursion can occur through deeper call chains, so their full callees must be checked. \n- struct metal_spinlock definition: the acquire/release implementations may invoke function pointers stored in the lock object (or otherwise use callbacks) that could call spinlock_thread. \n- Macros/inline wrappers used to implement acquire/release: acquire/release might be macros or inline functions that expand to other calls; you must inspect those expansions. \n- Any function-pointer variables or callbacks referenced by the above: these can produce indirect calls not visible in a simple static call graph and could create recursion back to spinlock_thread.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions/implementations, not just prototypes) is sufficient to trace all reachable calls from spinlock_thread and determine whether any path leads back to it."
