  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code. The call metal_spinlock_release(l) from spinlock_thread does not itself show any direct or indirect call back to spinlock_thread. Therefore, Rule 17.2 is not violated. (It would be violated only if metal_spinlock_release, or some function it calls, directly or indirectly invoked spinlock_thread \u2014 for example if metal_spinlock_release called a callback that eventually called spinlock_thread, creating recursion.)"
