  "explanation": "To determine whether spinlock_thread violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect any reachable code that might call memcmp and the types/objects that could be compared. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- metal_spinlock_acquire (definition): spinlock_thread calls this function. Its body might call memcmp (directly or via wrappers). You must examine its implementation to see if memcmp is used to compare strings.\n\n- metal_spinlock_release (definition): same reason as above for the release path \u2014 it may contain or call code that uses memcmp incorrectly.\n\n- transitive_callees_of_metal_spinlock_acquire_and_release (definitions): memcmp may be invoked not directly in the acquire/release functions but in functions they call. The full transitive call chain from those two functions must be available so the analyzer can find any memcmp uses reachable from spinlock_thread.\n\n- memcmp (declaration/implementation): to check whether any invocation conforms to the unsafe pattern (i.e., used to compare null-terminated strings) you need the memcmp symbol so the analyzer can recognize calls, their arguments, and link them back to string objects (and detect wrapper aliases or macro mappings to memcmp).\n\n- struct metal_spinlock (definition): to determine whether any field(s) of the spinlock object (or data reachable from it) are character buffers or pointers to null-terminated strings that could be passed to memcmp, the structure definition is needed. This helps decide whether a found memcmp usage is comparing null-terminated strings.\n\nNote: Other global symbols in spinlock_thread (spinlock_test_count, total) are not relevant to the memcmp rule (they are counters/integers), so they are not required for the memcmp-specific MISRA analysis. The key requirement is the implementations and transitive call graph of the two callees plus the memcmp symbol itself."
