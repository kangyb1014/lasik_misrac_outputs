  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only code that can affect compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is the for-loop header and any code that can modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop clauses (including functions called from the loop body). The listed fragments are those that need inspection to ensure: (a) the first, second and third clauses of the for statement meet the rule requirements, (b) there is only one loop counter and it is not modified in the loop body or by any called function, and (c) objects used in the loop clauses are not modified in the loop body. Other fragments in the provided function (function signature, return NULL, surrounding code not shown) do not affect the well-formedness of the for loop and therefore do not require investigation for Rule 14.2. Additionally, declarations or definitions unrelated to the loop counter or the loop clauses (e.g. unrelated functions or unrelated global variables not referenced by the loop header/body) are not relevant to this rule and so are not included."
