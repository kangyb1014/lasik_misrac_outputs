  "explanation": "- metal_spinlock_acquire (declaration/definition): you must know the parameter type and whether the function mutates the lock. If its prototype takes a non-const pointer or its body modifies the pointed object, the pointer passed from spinlock_thread cannot be const-qualified.\n- metal_spinlock_release (declaration/definition): same reasoning as for acquire \u2014 its signature and implementation determine whether the lock object is modified and thus whether the pointer can be const.\n- struct metal_spinlock (type definition): the structure layout and member mutability help determine whether operations on the lock conceptually require mutation (and therefore a non-const pointer). Some fields or API expectations may mandate non-const access.\n- thread-start API / caller prototype for spinlock_thread (e.g. pthread_create callback type): spinlock_thread is typically used as a thread entry function. The required callback signature (provided by the thread API used) may mandate a void * parameter and a void * return, preventing changing the parameter to a const-qualified pointer even if the body does not modify the pointed data. You need this to decide whether the parameter type can legally be made const under the calling-convention constraints."
