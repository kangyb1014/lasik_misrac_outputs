  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The pointer 'l' is passed to metal_spinlock_acquire(), which is expected to modify the spinlock state (acquire/release), so the pointee must be mutable and cannot be const-qualified. Also 'arg' is the pthread-style void * parameter, so converting to a non-const struct metal_spinlock * is appropriate here. The rule would be violated only if the function did not modify the pointee but the pointer was not const-qualified; that is not the case in this usage."
