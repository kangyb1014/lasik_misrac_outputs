  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_run_noblock participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the functions that call it and the functions they call (transitively) to see if any call path returns to metal_run_noblock. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- condition: It is a direct caller of metal_run_noblock (per the static call graph). You must inspect condition's body to see whether it (directly or via its callees) calls metal_run_noblock again, producing an indirect cycle.\n\n- metal_run: It is also a direct caller of metal_run_noblock. metal_run's implementation (and its callees) must be checked for any path back to metal_run_noblock.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: Shown as a callee of condition and metal_run. If metal_finish_threads (or any function it calls) can call metal_run_noblock, that would form a cycle and must be examined.\n\n- atomic, mutex, shmem, spinlock: These are callers of metal_run (per the static graph). You need to inspect these modules because they may participate in call chains that include metal_run and could close a cycle back to metal_run_noblock.\n\n- pthread_create: Although not shown in the simplified static call graph, the source calls pthread_create. pthread_create starts a new thread that executes the child function. If that child (or functions it calls) eventually invokes metal_run_noblock, that would create an indirect recursion-like cycle (cross-thread). You must consider pthread_create's effect when reasoning about possible call paths originating from the spawned child.\n\n- metal_thread_t (the child function pointer and the set of possible target functions): metal_run_noblock takes a child function pointer and spawns it. To determine whether spawning the child can produce an indirect call path back to metal_run_noblock you must know which concrete functions can be passed as child (their implementations). Any such child function that calls (directly or indirectly) metal_run_noblock would create an indirect call cycle.\n\nIn short: inspect all callers (condition, metal_run), their callees (metal_finish_threads) and upstream callers (atomic, mutex, shmem, spinlock), and also consider pthread_create + the concrete child functions (metal_thread_t) because a spawned child could call back into metal_run_noblock. These symbols are required to conclude whether any call chain exists that would make metal_run_noblock call itself (directly or indirectly)."
