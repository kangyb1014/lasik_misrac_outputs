  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in metal_run_noblock are provably unreachable you must examine: \n\n- condition (caller): it is a direct caller of metal_run_noblock (per the call graph). Inspecting its implementation is required to know whether it ever calls metal_run_noblock with tids == NULL or with particular threads values that would make the NULL-check branch or the loop body unreachable. If condition never invokes metal_run_noblock or always supplies non-NULL tids, the tids==NULL branch in metal_run_noblock may be unreachable.\n\n- metal_run (caller): another direct caller. For the same reason as above, you must inspect metal_run to determine whether it can call metal_run_noblock with tids == NULL or with parameters that make parts of metal_run_noblock unreachable.\n\n- metal_log (logging function/macro): metal_run_noblock calls metal_log immediately before returning on the tids==NULL path and on thread-create failure. If metal_log is implemented (or annotated) as a non-returning function (e.g. it calls exit(), abort(), longjmp(), or has a noreturn attribute), then the subsequent return statements/lines would be unreachable; conversely if metal_log always returns, those lines are reachable. You must inspect metal_log semantics/attributes to determine reachability of code after its invocation.\n\n- pthread_create (library call): the loop behaviour and the code following pthread_create depend on the runtime behaviour of pthread_create. If pthread_create were to be implemented or wrapped in this project in a way that never returns (or always fails/succeeds in a way that makes the loop body/break unreachable), that affects reachability of the loop body, the error handling branch and the break. Although the standard pthread_create returns, you must confirm there are no project-specific wrappers/macros that change that behaviour.\n\n(Other symbols used in the function such as strerror, EINVAL, pthread_t type or METAL_LOG_ERROR token are not necessary to decide reachability: they do not affect control flow or the possibility that a statement is never executed.)"
