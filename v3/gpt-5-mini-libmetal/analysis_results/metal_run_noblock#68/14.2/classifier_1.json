  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_run_noblock:\n```c\nint metal_run_noblock(int threads, metal_thread_t child,\n\t\t     void *arg, void *tids, int *threads_out)\n{\n\tint error, i;\n\tpthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids;\n\n\tif (!tids) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"invalid argument, tids is NULL.\\n\");\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\n\terror = 0;\n\tfor (i = 0; i < threads; i++) {\n\t\terror = -pthread_create(&tid_p[i], NULL, child, arg);\n\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"failed to create thread - %s\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t  strerror(error));\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t*threads_out = i;\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_run_noblock:\ntypedef void *(*metal_thread_t)(void *)\n...\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"failed to create thread - %s\\n\",\n\t\t\t  strerror(error));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The for loop uses 'i' as the single loop counter, the loop condition is 'i < threads' (no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter and 'threads' which is not modified in the body), and the third clause 'i++' modifies only the loop counter. The metal_log(...strerror(error)) call is inside the loop body; although it calls functions, none of those functions modify the loop counter or the object used in the loop clauses. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated."
