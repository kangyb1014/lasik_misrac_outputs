  "explanation": "I examined the provided function metal_run_noblock and the related definitions. There is no use of memcmp anywhere in the function, the macro metal_log, or the shown typedef; no string comparison operations are present (no memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or direct character-by-character comparisons). The only string-related call is strerror(error) used to obtain an error message for logging, which is not a comparison and therefore not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Because memcmp is not used to compare null-terminated strings in any of the provided code fragments, there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation under Rule 21.14."
