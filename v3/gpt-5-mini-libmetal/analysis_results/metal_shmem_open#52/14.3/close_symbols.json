  "explanation": "To determine whether any controlling expression in metal_shmem_open is invariant (MISRA rule) we must inspect the loop and any values it tests or that could be impacted by callees:\n\n- metal_for_each_page_size_down (macro/definition): The loop in the function is written using this macro. MISRA concerns the loop's controlling expression (initialization, test, and iteration). We need the macro expansion to see the actual for/while controlling expression (is it a constant, an always-true/always-false test, or an intentional infinite loop allowed by the exception). Without the macro body we cannot judge invariance.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (definition, including the page_size field type): The loop body tests ps->page_size > 2 * size. To evaluate whether that controlling expression is invariant we must know the type and semantics of page_size (signed/unsigned width) and whether ps refers to distinct entries across iterations. The struct shows whether page_size is mutable, its type (affects comparison/constant folding), and layout relevant to iteration.\n\n- iterator helper symbols used by metal_for_each_page_size_down (initializer / condition / advance functions or macros): The macro will typically call or reference helper functions/macros to initialize the iterator, test termination, and advance to the next element (e.g., first/last/next/prev). These symbols determine whether ps actually changes between loop iterations (so the ps->page_size test is varying) or whether the loop uses a fixed/invariant controlling expression. Their definitions are required to conclude if the controlling expression is invariant or intentionally infinite.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (full definition/implementation): metal_shmem_try_map is called inside the loop and receives ps (pointer). It could modify the page-size list or mutate the ps object (for example change ps->page_size or global iterator state), which would affect whether the controlling expression remains invariant across iterations. We must inspect this function to see if it mutates ps or any state used by the loop condition.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine (a) what the loop's controlling expression actually is after macro expansion, (b) whether that expression can change across iterations, (c) whether any change is caused by the loop body or callees, and (d) whether any invariant/infinite-loop exception applies under MISRA."
