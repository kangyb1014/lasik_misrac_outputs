  "explanation": "All other code fragments are simple assignments, function calls, or non-controlling statements (e.g., 'close(fd);', 'return error;') and thus cannot violate Rule 14.3. The listed fragments cover every controlling construct in the function: the two if-statements and the loop (including its inner conditionals). These should be investigated because the loop is a macro invocation whose expansion may contain an invariant controlling expression, and the if/loop conditions are the only controlling expressions present in the function. No other control expressions exist in the provided code that would need inspection for invariance."
