Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- metal_for_each_page_size_down (macro/iterator implementation): The loop in the target function is written using this macro. MISRA checking requires examining the three clauses of the actual for statement (initialization, condition, iteration expression) to determine the loop counter and whether the clauses have forbidden side effects or reference objects modified in the body. The macro expansion contains the real for(...) header and identifies the loop counter and any loop-control flags; therefore its definition/expansion is essential.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (full definition): The variable ps is declared as a pointer to this type and is used inside the loop and (very likely) by the iterator macro. The structure fields (e.g. page_size and any next/prev pointers) are needed to see which objects are read/modified by the loop header/condition or iterator, and whether any of these fields could be modified by the loop body (directly or indirectly).\n\n- any global/static symbols referenced by metal_for_each_page_size_down (e.g. page-size list head/tail/counter used by the iterator): The iterator macro may reference global/static objects (list heads, indexes, counters). The MISRA rule forbids the second clause using objects that are modified in the loop body; if the for-condition or increment uses such global objects they must be inspected to ensure they are not changed by the loop body or functions called from it. Listing these specific globals (as found in the macro) is required to check that constraint.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (full implementation/prototype): This function is called inside the loop body. MISRA explicitly includes the behaviour of called functions in the loop body behaviour, so we must inspect metal_shmem_try_map for any modifications to the loop counter, loop-control flags, or to any objects used in the for-condition/increment. We also need to know whether it has persistent side effects relevant to clause rules.\n\n- metal_map, metal_unmap, metal_io_init, metal_virt2phys (full implementations/prototypes): These functions are called (directly or indirectly) by metal_shmem_try_map (per the static call graph). Because behaviour of any functions called in the loop body counts as part of the loop body, their implementations must be checked for side effects on the loop counter or on any objects used in the for-condition/increment (including globals referenced by the iterator). Any modification to those objects inside these functions could make the for-loop violate the MISRA requirements.\n\nSummary: to determine compliance with the MISRA \u201cfor loop shall be well-formed\u201d constraints you must (1) expand metal_for_each_page_size_down to see the actual for(...) clauses and identify the loop counter and any loop-control flags or globals used by the header, (2) inspect struct metal_page_size and any globals the iterator uses to ensure they are not modified by the loop body, and (3) inspect metal_shmem_try_map and its callees for side effects that would modify the loop counter, loop-control flags, or any objects used in the loop header/conditions."
