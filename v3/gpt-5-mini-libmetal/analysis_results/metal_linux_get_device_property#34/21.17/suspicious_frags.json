  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve writing or copying into buffers via pointer parameters and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17. Specifically, the to_linux_device helper call, the integer local variables (fd, status, flags, mode), the errno-based return and status handling, the close(fd) calls, and the return expressions do not perform string/byte-buffer writes via pointer parameters and hence do not create potential out-of-bounds accesses covered by this rule. No other uses of standard string.h functions (e.g. strcpy, memcpy, memmove, strcat, strlen, etc.) appear in the function, so they need not be investigated further for Rule 21.17."
