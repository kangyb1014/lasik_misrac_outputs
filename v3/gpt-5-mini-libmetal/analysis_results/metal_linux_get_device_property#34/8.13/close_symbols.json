  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- to_linux_device (declaration/definition): The target function only uses the device pointer by passing it to to_linux_device and then reading ldev->sdev->path. To decide whether the parameter struct metal_device *device can/should be const, we must know to_linux_device's signature and implementation: does it modify the metal_device or require a non-const pointer, or does it return a pointer that must be mutable? If to_linux_device mutates device or intentionally returns mutable data, making device const in the target function may not be possible.\n\n- struct metal_device (declaration/definition): Knowing the metal_device type can show whether there are operations in to_linux_device or elsewhere that require non-const access to particular members. It also helps determine whether passing a const struct metal_device * would be compatible with existing APIs and whether any member accesses in the call chain imply mutation.\n\n- struct linux_device (declaration/definition): The function stores the result of to_linux_device in a variable ldev and only reads ldev->sdev->path. To check whether ldev (and thus to_linux_device's return) could/should be const-qualified, we need the linux_device definition to see whether subsequent users or the returned object are intended to be mutable.\n\n- type of linux_device::sdev (declaration/definition) and its member sdev->path (type): The code reads ldev->sdev->path as a string passed to snprintf. We must know whether path is declared as const char * or char * (or some other pointer-qualified type). If path is already const-qualified, that supports read-only usage; if it is non-const, that affects whether ldev (or sdev) could be const-qualified and whether there are API mismatches.\n\n- open(\u2026) prototype (declaration): open's first parameter is a const char *; confirming this ensures passing ldev->sdev->path (possibly non-const) to open/snprintf is allowed and whether any const casts are required. This helps determine whether any pointer should be const-qualified in the call chain.\n\n- read(\u2026) prototype (declaration): read writes into the buffer passed as its second argument (void *). Confirming read(void *) vs read(const void *) shows that the output parameter of the target function must be non-const (it will be written), so output should not be const-qualified.\n\n- snprintf(\u2026) prototype (declaration): snprintf expects const char * format and const arguments for string inputs; confirming its prototype helps check whether passing ldev->sdev->path (possibly non-const) requires adding const qualifiers or casts, informing whether members should be const.\n\nThese symbols together let the analyser determine whether pointers in the target function (particularly struct metal_device *device, the returned linux_device pointer, sdev->path, and the output buffer) could or should be changed to point to const-qualified types without violating called APIs."
