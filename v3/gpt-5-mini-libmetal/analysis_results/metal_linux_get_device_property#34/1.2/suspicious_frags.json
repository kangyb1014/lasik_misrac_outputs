  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The function and structs use only standard C constructs and POSIX API calls (open/read/close, errno, snprintf). I found no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values, or other GNU/C specific builtins in the shown code.\n\nNote: a macro call appears (metal_container_of) in to_linux_device. Its use here is not by itself an extension; however, the macro definition (not provided) should be reviewed because container_of-style macros sometimes use the GNU typeof extension or other non-standard constructs. Since that macro's definition is not in the supplied snippets, I did not mark any code as suspicious based solely on the call. If you provide the macro and other related macros/headers, I can re-evaluate them for language extensions."
