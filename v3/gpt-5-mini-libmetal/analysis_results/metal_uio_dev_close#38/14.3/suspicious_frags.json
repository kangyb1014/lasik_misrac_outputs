  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are syntactically invariant constants or obviously constant at compile time. Specifically:\n- for (i = 0; i < ldev->device.num_regions; i++) \u2014 the loop condition depends on ldev->device.num_regions, which is a runtime value and not a compile-time constant; it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n- if (ldev->override) \u2014 the condition depends on the runtime value of the pointer ldev->override and is not invariant.\n- if (ldev->sdev) \u2014 likewise depends on a runtime pointer value and is not invariant.\n- if (ldev->fd >= 0) \u2014 this depends on the runtime file-descriptor value and is not an invariant compile-time constant.\n- There are no do-while loops with a constant false controlling expression, nor any explicit infinite-loop constructs that would rely on an invariant controlling expression (the permitted exception for intentional infinite loops does not apply here).\n\nTherefore no fragments in this function require investigation for Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). If there is concern that any of these runtime values are in practice constant in a particular build/configuration, that project-specific evidence should be provided for further review."
