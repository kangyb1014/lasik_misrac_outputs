First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_close:\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_close(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\tstruct linux_device *ldev)\n{\n\t(void)lbus;\n\tunsigned int i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < ldev->device.num_regions; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_unmap(ldev->device.regions[i].virt,\n\t\t\t    ldev->device.regions[i].size);\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->override) {\n\t\tsysfs_write_attribute(ldev->override, \"\", 1);\n\t\tldev->override = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->sdev) {\n\t\tsysfs_close_device(ldev->sdev);\n\t\tldev->sdev = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->fd >= 0) {\n\t\tclose(ldev->fd);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nunsigned int i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'i' is the single loop counter used by the for loop. The first clause assigns i = 0 (initializes the counter), the second clause uses i and ldev->device.num_regions (which is not modified in the loop body as shown), and the third clause only increments i (i++). The loop body does not modify i. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated. Note: If any function called in the loop body (e.g. metal_unmap) or the body itself were to modify ldev->device.num_regions or i, that would create a violation."
