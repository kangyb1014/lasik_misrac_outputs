  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_close:\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_close(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\tstruct linux_device *ldev)\n{\n\t(void)lbus;\n\tunsigned int i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < ldev->device.num_regions; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_unmap(ldev->device.regions[i].virt,\n\t\t\t    ldev->device.regions[i].size);\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->override) {\n\t\tsysfs_write_attribute(ldev->override, \"\", 1);\n\t\tldev->override = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->sdev) {\n\t\tsysfs_close_device(ldev->sdev);\n\t\tldev->sdev = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->fd >= 0) {\n\t\tclose(ldev->fd);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (ldev->fd >= 0) {\n\t\tclose(ldev->fd);\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The conditional close(ldev->fd) releases a resource; removing it would change program behaviour (resource leak/FD remains open). This is therefore not dead code. (It would only be dead if it were provable that the call is never executed in any program run or that close() is a no-op, which is not shown here.)"
