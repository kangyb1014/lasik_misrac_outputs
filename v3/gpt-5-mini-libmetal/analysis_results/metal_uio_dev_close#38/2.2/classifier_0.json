  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_close:\n```c\nstatic void metal_uio_dev_close(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\tstruct linux_device *ldev)\n{\n\t(void)lbus;\n\tunsigned int i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < ldev->device.num_regions; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_unmap(ldev->device.regions[i].virt,\n\t\t\t    ldev->device.regions[i].size);\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->override) {\n\t\tsysfs_write_attribute(ldev->override, \"\", 1);\n\t\tldev->override = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->sdev) {\n\t\tsysfs_close_device(ldev->sdev);\n\t\tldev->sdev = NULL;\n\t}\n\tif (ldev->fd >= 0) {\n\t\tclose(ldev->fd);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (ldev->override) {\n\t\tsysfs_write_attribute(ldev->override, \"\", 1);\n\t\tldev->override = NULL;\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment performs observable side-effects: sysfs_write_attribute(...) modifies kernel/sysfs state and setting ldev->override = NULL changes program state to prevent further use of the old pointer. Removing these operations would change program behaviour (sysfs contents and pointer state), so this is not dead code."
