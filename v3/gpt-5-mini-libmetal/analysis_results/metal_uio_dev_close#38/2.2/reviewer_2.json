  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement (void)lbus; is the conventional, intentional idiom to indicate that the parameter lbus is unused in this function and to suppress compiler/analysis warnings. MISRA C's prohibition on dead code (Rule 2.2) targets operations that are genuinely redundant and unintended such that their removal would not affect program behaviour. In this case the expression-statement is a deliberate use to document intent and to satisfy tooling; it is not an unintended leftover. Moreover, in MISRA practice the explicit discard of an unused parameter is an accepted way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused. If you prefer, other alternatives (e.g. removing the parameter name in a declaration where allowed, or annotating with a standard attribute) can be used, but the presence of (void)lbus; here is not a violation of Rule 2.2. Therefore the agent A report is not correct."
