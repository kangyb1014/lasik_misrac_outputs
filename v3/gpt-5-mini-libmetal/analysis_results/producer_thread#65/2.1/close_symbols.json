  "explanation": "To decide if any statements in producer_thread are statically unreachable we must know which conditions are constant or whether other code can change them and whether called synchronization functions can block/never return. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- counter: The while loop condition depends on this global variable. We need its declaration, type, storage duration and any initial value or qualifiers (e.g. volatile, atomic) and visible writes to determine if the expression counter == COUNTER_MAX can be considered a compile\u2011time constant or never changes, which would make the loop (and subsequent code) unreachable.\n\n- COUNTER_MAX: The loop compares counter to this macro/constant. If COUNTER_MAX is a compile\u2011time constant or defined such that the comparison is always true/false, the reachability of code after the loop can be decided statically.\n\n- consumer_thread: Producer waits on nfull_condv until consumer decrements counter. To know whether counter can be changed (and thus the loop can terminate), we must inspect consumer_thread to see if and how it modifies counter and signals the condition variable.\n\n- metal_condition_wait: The loop body calls this function. Its semantics (does it release the mutex, block, return only when signalled, or is it annotated noreturn) are crucial to determine whether the loop can ever complete and whether code after the loop is reachable.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire and metal_mutex_release: If either is implemented or declared in a way that it does not return (noreturn) or otherwise prevents progress (e.g. dead\u2011locking), that affects reachability of later statements. Their prototypes/attributes and semantics are needed for a correct analysis.\n\n- metal_condition_signal: Although producer calls it, its semantics (e.g. whether it can cause other threads to modify counter) and any special attributes may affect whether the wait in other threads succeeds and hence whether the producer's loop can terminate; include it to inspect interactions with consumer/condition semantics.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyzer determine whether the while loop condition is effectively constant/unchangeable or whether the blocking/wait calls can prevent progress \u2014 the two main causes of unreachable code in this function."
