  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above are not considered suspicious for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) because they are reachable in the expected control flows: the counter increment/decrement statements, condition signal calls, mutex acquire/release calls, atomic load/add/sub operations, the futex syscall and the final return statements are all on execution paths reachable from the thread entry points or after the wait/syscall returns. The listed fragments deserve inspection: the two condition-wait loops may block indefinitely under certain runtime conditions and thus warrant review for possible logic that makes subsequent statements effectively unreachable; the initial argument/acquired-mutex check in metal_condition_wait and the atomic_compare_exchange_strong handling contain branches that appear logically redundant or impossible (and therefore potentially unreachable) and should be verified for correctness. No other statements in the provided excerpts exhibit obvious static unreachability."
