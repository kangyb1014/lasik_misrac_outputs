  "explanation": "Only function-call sites and interactions between functions can produce direct or indirect recursion. I selected all call sites and synchronization operations from producer_thread and the metal_condition_wait implementation so the other agents can check whether any of those calls (e.g. mutex/condition routines or syscall wrappers) ultimately call back into producer_thread. The remaining fragments in the code (local variable declarations, (void)arg;, the loop condition check itself, the counter++ increment, simple return NULL, and literal/error returns) are not function calls or call-sites that could form a call cycle and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
