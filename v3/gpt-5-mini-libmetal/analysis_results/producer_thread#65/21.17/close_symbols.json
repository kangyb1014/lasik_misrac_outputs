  "explanation": "To decide whether producer_thread violates the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions, the analyzer must inspect any functions or data reachable from producer_thread that could (directly or indirectly) invoke standard string functions or perform out-of-bounds pointer accesses. For each symbol:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: provide the function body/prototype so the analyzer can check whether it calls any string.h routines (e.g., in logging, error handling) or manipulates buffers/pointers unsafely.\n- metal_mutex_release: same reason as metal_mutex_acquire (may hide string usage or buffer access).\n- metal_condition_wait: it is called directly by producer_thread and itself calls mutex helpers; its implementation must be checked for any string.h calls or unsafe pointer/buffer operations.\n- metal_condition_signal: called by producer_thread; its implementation must be checked for any hidden string operations.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: called by metal_condition_wait; include its implementation to ensure no string.h usage or unsafe pointer accesses propagate through it.\n- lock: the actual variable referenced by metal_mutex_acquire/release; its definition is needed to inspect any embedded pointers or internal state that could be passed to string functions.\n- nfull_condv and nempty_condv: the condition-variable objects used by metal_condition_wait/signal; their definitions are needed to see if they contain pointers or buffer fields accessed by the condition functions.\n- counter and COUNTER_MAX: definitions/types are needed to rule out indirect buffer-indexing or pointer arithmetic issues in producer_thread or in callee implementations that might use these values to index buffers passed to string functions.\n- metal_mutex_t (type of lock) and metal_condvar_t (type of nfull_condv/nempty_condv): the concrete types (struct definitions) are required so the analyzer can inspect internal members for potential buffer/pointer fields that callee functions might pass to string.h functions.\n\nInclude the full implementations (or at least prototypes plus bodies) of the listed functions and the definitions of the listed variables/types. With these close symbols, the next agent can determine whether any path reachable from producer_thread invokes string.h functions or performs out-of-bounds accesses as covered by the MISRA rule."
