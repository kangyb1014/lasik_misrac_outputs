  "explanation": "No code fragments modify a function parameter variable (the pointer parameter itself), so none need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically:\n\n- producer_thread(void *arg): arg is only cast to void to silence unused-parameter warnings ((void)arg;). There is no assignment to arg or any modification of the parameter variable.\n\n- metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv, metal_mutex_t *m): neither cv nor m (the pointer parameters) are reassigned or modified. The function operates on the objects pointed to by cv and m (e.g., atomic operations on cv->wakeups and cv->waiters, metal_mutex_release(m), metal_mutex_acquire(m), and syscall with &cv->wakeups). Modifying the pointed-to objects is permitted by the rule; only modifying the pointer variable itself would be a violation, and no such assignments exist (m is converted to an integer into a separate local mptr, but m itself is not changed).\n\n- Calls in producer_thread such as metal_mutex_acquire(&lock), metal_condition_wait(&nfull_condv, &lock), metal_condition_signal(&nempty_condv), and metal_mutex_release(&lock) pass addresses of global objects; they do not modify any pointer parameter variable within the caller.\n\nBecause no function parameter variables are assigned to or otherwise modified in the provided code, there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 to report."
