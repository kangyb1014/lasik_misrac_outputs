  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All pointer parameters and uses in the provided code appear to require non-const qualification:\n\n- producer_thread(void *arg): The void *arg parameter is the standard pthread entry signature and is unused here; it cannot be made const without changing the required thread-entry prototype.\n- metal_condition_wait(struct metal_condition *cv, metal_mutex_t *m): cv is modified (cv->mptr, cv->wakeups, cv->waiters) and is used with futex; it must be non-const. m is passed to metal_mutex_release/metal_mutex_acquire and is mutated by those operations (and is checked with metal_mutex_is_acquired), so it must be non-const.\n- Atomic operations and syscall: atomic_load/atomic_fetch_add/atomic_fetch_sub operate on modifiable members (&cv->wakeups, &cv->waiters). syscall(SYS_futex, &cv->wakeups, ...) passes a modifiable address to the kernel; these pointers cannot be const.\n- Calls that take &lock, &nfull_condv, &nempty_condv: those objects represent synchronization primitives which are operated on (acquire/release/signal/wait), so their addresses must be non-const.\n\nGiven these facts, none of the pointer uses shown can reasonably be changed to point to a const-qualified type without breaking functionality; therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
