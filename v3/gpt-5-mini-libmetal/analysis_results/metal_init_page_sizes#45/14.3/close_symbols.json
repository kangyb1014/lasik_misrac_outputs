  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to judge whether any controlling expression in metal_init_page_sizes is invariant:\n\n- getpagesize: sizes[0] is set from getpagesize() and then used in the controlling expression sizes[0] <= 0. You must know the semantics/possible return values of getpagesize() (and whether it can be treated as a compile-time constant on the target) to decide if that controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- gethugepagesize: the code tests gethugepagesize() in two places (assignment to sizes[0] in the MAP_HUGE_SHIFT-not-defined path and the conditional gethugepagesize() >= 0 in the other path). Its possible return values determine whether those if conditions are invariant.\n\n- gethugepagesizes: the for-loop controlling expression uses count returned by gethugepagesizes(sizes, max_sizes). To decide whether the loop condition i < count is invariant (e.g. count always zero or always constant) you must know gethugepagesizes() behavior and possible return range.\n\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES: used to compute max_sizes passed to gethugepagesizes; it bounds the sizes buffer and can affect whether gethugepagesizes can return particular counts. Its value is needed to reason about count invariance/possibility of the loop executing.\n\n- HAVE_HUGETLBFS_H: a compile-time macro that governs whether the whole hugepage-related block is compiled. Whether this symbol is defined changes which controlling expressions exist in the compiled code, so it must be known to determine which invariance checks are relevant.\n\n- MAP_HUGE_SHIFT: presence/absence of this macro selects between two different hugepage-handling branches (#ifndef MAP_HUGE_SHIFT). The definedness influences which controlling expressions appear and therefore which invariance checks apply.\n\n- MAP_HUGE_MASK: used in the controlling expression (shift & MAP_HUGE_MASK) != shift inside the hugepage loop. Its numeric value (bitmask width) and the range of shift (from metal_log2 applied to sizes[]) are required to determine whether that expression can be invariant.\n\nNote: metal_log2 and metal_add_page_size are already in the call graph; metal_log2's return range will also be needed when reasoning about 'shift' but it was already listed as a callee."
