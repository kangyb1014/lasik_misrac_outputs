True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nWhen both HAVE_HUGETLBFS_H and MAP_HUGE_SHIFT are defined, the call to gethugepagesize() in the guarded if (gethugepagesize() >= 0) is executed only to decide whether to call gethugepagesizes() and its return value is otherwise unused. If gethugepagesizes() already provides the necessary information about available huge page sizes and gethugepagesize() has no side effects, that preliminary gethugepagesize() call is redundant: removing it would not change program behaviour. This constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nmetal_init_page_sizes: getpagesize() -> 4096\nmetal_init_page_sizes: base page_size=4096, page_shift=12\nmetal_init_page_sizes: gethugepagesize() -> 2097152 (multi-size guard)\nmetal_init_page_sizes: gethugepagesizes() -> 2\nmetal_init_page_sizes: sizes[0]=2097152, shift=21\nmetal_init_page_sizes: added hugetlbfs size=2097152, shift=21, flags=0x54040000\nmetal_init_page_sizes: sizes[1]=1073741824, shift=30\nmetal_init_page_sizes: added hugetlbfs size=1073741824, shift=30, flags=0x78040000\nmetal_init_page_sizes: qsort start, num_page_sizes=1\nmetal_init_page_sizes: qsort done\nmetal_init_page_sizes: getpagesize() -> 4096\nmetal_init_page_sizes: base page_size=4096, page_shift=12\nmetal_init_page_sizes: gethugepagesize() -> 2097152 (multi-size guard)\nmetal_init_page_sizes: gethugepagesizes() -> 2\nmetal_init_page_sizes: sizes[0]=2097152, shift=21\nmetal_init_page_sizes: added hugetlbfs size=2097152, shift=21, flags=0x54040000\nmetal_init_page_sizes: sizes[1]=1073741824, shift=30\nmetal_init_page_sizes: added hugetlbfs size=1073741824, shift=30, flags=0x78040000\nmetal_init_page_sizes: qsort start, num_page_sizes=1\nmetal_init_page_sizes: qsort done\n\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_init_page_sizes:\n#define MAX_PAGE_SIZES 32\n...\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n...\nstruct metal_page_size {\n\t/** Page size. */\n\tsize_t\tpage_size;\n\n\t/** Page shift. */\n\tunsigned long page_shift;\n\n\t/** Path to hugetlbfs (or tmpfs) mount point. */\n\tchar path[PATH_MAX];\n\n\t/** Flags to use for mmap. */\n\tint mmap_flags;\n}\n...\nstatic int metal_pagesize_compare(const void *_a, const void *_b)\n{\n\tconst struct metal_page_size *a = _a, *b = _b;\n\tlong diff = a->page_size - b->page_size;\n\n\treturn metal_sign(diff);\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The gethugepagesize() call inside the #ifdef/#else branch is being used as a runtime capability check (a guard) to decide whether to attempt the multi-size path (gethugepagesizes()). You cannot assume that calling gethugepagesize() has no effect or that its removal would not change program behaviour on all targets: it is a call into the system/library which may indicate at runtime whether the multi-size API is available, may affect errno or other system state, or may be required for proper feature detection on some platforms. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids code whose removal would not affect behaviour; here removal could affect behaviour on some systems, so the call is not clearly dead code. If, for a particular project and platform, you have evidence that gethugepagesize() is pure and redundant and its removal cannot change behaviour, then you can refactor or remove it \u2014 but that is a project-specific justification, not a general MISRA violation in the snippet as presented."
