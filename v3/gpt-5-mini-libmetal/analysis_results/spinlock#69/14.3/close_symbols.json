  "explanation": "- metal_run: The controlling expression \"if (!error)\" depends entirely on metal_run's return value. You must see metal_run's prototype and implementation/contract to know whether it can return different values at runtime (and under what conditions), or whether it is effectively constant for this test. Also needed to determine whether metal_run waits for spawned threads to complete or returns before they run to completion.\n\n- metal_run_noblock: metal_run calls metal_run_noblock (per the static call graph). Inspecting metal_run_noblock is necessary to determine whether metal_run may return without waiting for threads (i.e. non\u2011blocking behavior) which affects whether subsequent reads of globals are invariant.\n\n- metal_finish_threads: metal_run also calls metal_finish_threads; its semantics (waiting/joining threads) determine whether the worker threads have completed and therefore whether globals read after metal_run can have changed. This directly affects whether the later controlling expression \"if (value)\" can be variant.\n\n- spinlock_thread: The worker thread function run by metal_run may modify the globals used to compute value (total and/or spinlock_test_count). You must inspect its body to see which globals it updates and whether those updates occur before metal_run returns.\n\n- total: value is read from the global total after metal_run. You must know total's declaration (type, volatile/atomic qualifiers), definition, initialization and all writers (including whether worker threads modify it) to decide if reading total yields a non\u2011invariant value.\n\n- spinlock_test_count: value is computed using spinlock_test_count and threads. You must know spinlock_test_count's declaration (volatile/atomic qualifiers), definition, initialization and writers to determine whether spinlock_test_count * threads can be invariant.\n\nRationale summary: To decide if the controlling expressions \"if (!error)\" and \"if (value)\" are invariant you need (1) the exact semantics and possible return values of metal_run (and whether it waits for threads), (2) whether spawned threads (spinlock_thread) modify total or spinlock_test_count, and (3) the declarations/qualifiers of total and spinlock_test_count (volatile/atomic) so the compiler cannot legally treat those reads as invariant."
