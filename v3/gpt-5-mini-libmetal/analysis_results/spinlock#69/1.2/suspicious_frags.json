  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided code. The function and related symbols use only standard C constructs: function definition, local variables, struct declaration, and macros. The atomic type and initializer (atomic_flag and ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT) are part of the C11 <stdatomic.h> standard rather than a vendor-specific extension. There are no vendor-specific keywords or tokens (for example, __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __extension__, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or other compiler built-ins) present in the shown fragments. Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for Rule 1.2. (Note: small syntax issues in the additional snippets such as missing semicolons are not language extensions and thus are not relevant to Rule 1.2.)"
