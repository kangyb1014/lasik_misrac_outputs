  "scenario": "No violation: the address of 'lock' is passed to worker threads that will acquire/release the spinlock, so the pointed-to object must be modifiable. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified only when the pointee is not intended to be modified; in this case the spinlock is intentionally mutable, so using a non-const pointer is appropriate. (If, hypothetically, metal_run/spinlock_thread did not modify the pointee, then the API should take a pointer-to-const and passing a non-const pointer could indicate a rule breach.)"
