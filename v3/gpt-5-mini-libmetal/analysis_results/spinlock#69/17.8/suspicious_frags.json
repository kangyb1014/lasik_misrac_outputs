  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments and found no places where a function parameter itself is modified (i.e., assigned to or altered). Reasons by fragment:\n\n- spinlock(void): has no parameters, so Rule 17.8 does not apply.\n\n- metal_run(int threads, metal_thread_t child, void *arg): none of the parameters (threads, child, arg) are assigned to or modified in the body. threads is used to size a VLA and passed to other functions, child and arg are forwarded unchanged.\n\n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT and struct metal_spinlock: these are declarations/initializers and do not modify any function parameters.\n\n- spinlock_thread(void *arg): the parameter arg is used to initialize a local pointer (struct metal_spinlock *l = arg;). This does not modify the parameter variable arg itself; calls use l to modify the pointed-to object, which is permitted by the rule.\n\n- total, spinlock_test_count: these are global/constants and are modified/read in functions, but they are not function parameters.\n\n- metal_log macro: macro parameters are expanded into an expression that calls a log handler; no function parameter is altered.\n\nNote: helper functions called (metal_run_noblock, metal_finish_threads, metal_spinlock_acquire/release, etc.) are not shown in the provided snippets. If their definitions exist elsewhere, they should be checked separately for Rule 17.8 violations. Based on the shown code, there are no instances where a function parameter variable is modified and therefore no suspicious fragments to report."
