  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related definitions. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns the use of functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The shown code uses atomic_store and integer arithmetic/array indexing; it contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: bounds checking of the array index is a general safety concern but is not relevant to Rule 21.17, which is specific to string.h functions. If you want checks for other MISRA rules, indicate which rule.)"
