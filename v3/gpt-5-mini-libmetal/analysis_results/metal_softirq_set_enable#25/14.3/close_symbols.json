Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct metal_irq_controller (definition: fields irq_base, irq_num and their types/qualifiers)\n   - The first if-expression uses cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num. To decide whether that controlling expression is invariant (compile\u2011time constant or otherwise unchanging), you must know the declared types and qualifiers (const/volatile/static) of irq_base and irq_num and whether they can be modified at runtime. If they are compile\u2011time constants or effectively invariant in this translation unit, the expression could be flagged by MISRA; if they are non\u2011constant or volatile, the expression is not invariant.\n\n2) METAL_IRQ_ENABLE (macro / enum / constant definition)\n   - The second if-expression compares the parameter enable to METAL_IRQ_ENABLE. You need the exact definition (macro value, enum, or const) to determine whether the comparison is against a compile\u2011time constant and whether that makes the controlling expression invariant in the sense of the MISRA rule. Also necessary to see if METAL_IRQ_ENABLE could be defined as something that changes (e.g. macro depending on other macros) in the translation unit.\n\n3) metal_softirq_enabled (declaration and element type/qualification)\n   - Although not part of the controlling expressions, knowledge of the array element type (e.g. atomic type), its qualifiers (volatile), and its declaration helps determine whether any side effects or aliasing could make values used in the controlling expressions effectively variant. In particular, if irq_base/irq_num are computed from or tied to this shared state, or if qualifiers indicate special semantics, that affects whether the controlling expressions are invariant. Knowing the array element type also clarifies whether atomic operations elsewhere could affect program state relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n(Notes: atomic_store itself and the parameter types of irq/enable are present in the function and do not by themselves require extra symbols beyond the ones listed. The three symbols above are the minimal additional declarations needed to decide whether the two controlling expressions in this function are invariant for the purposes of the MISRA rule.)"
