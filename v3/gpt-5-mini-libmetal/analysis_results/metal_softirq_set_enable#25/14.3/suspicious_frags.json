  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not contain controlling expressions that could be invariant and thus do not need investigation for Rule 14.3. The assignment \"irq -= cntr->irq_base;\" is a simple arithmetic update and not a controlling expression. The atomic_store calls are side-effecting operations, not loop/branch controlling expressions by themselves. The initial function signature and the return statement are not controlling expressions. Therefore only the two if statements (the range check and the enable test) are relevant to investigate for invariant controlling expressions."
