  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: needed to know the exact type layout, qualifiers and semantic intent of the controller object used by the function. Whether fields are signed/unsigned/const can affect comparison outcomes and reachability.\n\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_base: the early-return condition compares irq against irq_base; to determine if the return always/never fires you must know irq_base (type and whether it can be a constant or constrained value).\n\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_num: used to compute the upper bound (irq_base + irq_num). If irq_num is zero or a constant/limited range this can make the early return unconditionally true or false, creating unreachable code.\n\n- definitions/initializers of metal_irq_controller instances (places that set irq_base/irq_num): field declarations alone do not show actual runtime values; you must inspect where controller instances are created/initialized to see whether irq_base/irq_num ever permit the body to execute.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: the if (enable == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) determines which branch executes. If METAL_IRQ_ENABLE is defined such that enable is always equal (or never equal) at all call sites, one branch would be unreachable.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled (declaration and its size/type): the array index calculation uses irq - irq_base; array size/type may constrain valid indices and could cause certain inputs to be impossible or make accesses UB \u2014 relevant to determining whether body statements can be reached safely.\n\n- atomic_store (definition/macro/implementation): atomic_store may be a function, inline, or macro that could be compiled away in some configurations; to decide whether the statements in each branch are meaningful reachable code you need its definition.\n\n- all call sites of metal_softirq_set_enable (callers and the values/expressions passed as 'irq' and 'enable'): MISRA unreachable-code analysis must consider actual uses. If every caller always passes an irq that falls outside the checked range or always passes a fixed 'enable' constant, parts of the function (the rest of the body or one branch) become unreachable.\n\n- relevant compile-time macros/configuration that affect METAL_IRQ_ENABLE or atomic_store: build-time options can change macro definitions or expand atomic_store to nothing; these can turn code into dead/unreachable code in particular builds and must be considered.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether the early return is always taken, whether one of the two enable branches can never execute, whether array indexing prevents entry to the body, or whether conditional compilation/definitions make parts of the function permanently unreachable."
