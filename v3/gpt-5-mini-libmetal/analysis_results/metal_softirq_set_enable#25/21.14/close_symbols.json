  "explanation": "\u2022 struct metal_irq_controller: Need the full definition (types of irq_base and irq_num) to confirm the index arithmetic and to ensure none of these fields are pointers to characters or strings (which could indicate string comparisons elsewhere). The MISRA memcmp rule is about comparing null\u2011terminated strings; verifying field types rules out indirect string usage.\n\n\u2022 METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: Need the exact macro/enum definition to ensure the comparison (enable == METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) is numeric and not comparing or expanding to a string operation or a function/macro that might perform string comparison.\n\n\u2022 metal_softirq_enabled: Need its declaration, element type and array dimensions so we can determine whether elements are character pointers or string types. If elements were char* or contained string data, stores could be related to string handling; if they are atomic integers/booleans, memcmp/string comparisons are unlikely.\n\n\u2022 atomic_store: Must inspect the actual definition/implementation of atomic_store used in this build (macro, inline, or function) to ensure it does not internally use memcmp or any string comparison. The MISRA check requires analyzing all called symbols that could perform a forbidden memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n\u2022 atomic_store_explicit, __atomic_store_n, __atomic_store: atomic_store may be an alias to one of these builtins or wrappers. Include them so the analyzer can follow any indirection to the compiler builtin or inline implementation and verify no memcmp or string comparison is performed there.\n\n\u2022 atomic type definitions (e.g. atomic_int/atomic_bool/atomic_t): Knowing the exact atomic type lets the analyzer confirm that atomic_store operates on integer/boolean types rather than pointer-to-char or string types. This is necessary to rule out memcmp on strings.\n\n\u2022 Header/platform atomic implementation (e.g. <stdatomic.h> or metal/atomic.h): The header will show how atomic_store and the atomic types are defined on this platform. The analyzer must inspect these headers to ensure no string comparison functions (like memcmp) are used in their implementation.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent trace all data types and called implementations reachable from metal_softirq_set_enable to determine whether any memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings could occur. If all of the above resolve to integer/boolean atomic stores and simple macros, the MISRA rule is not violated."
