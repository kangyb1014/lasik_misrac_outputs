  "explanation": "The only modification of a function parameter in this function is the assignment 'irq -= cntr->irq_base;'; this should be investigated for compliance with Rule 17.8. Other fragments do not modify function parameters: \u2022 The pointer parameter 'cntr' is only dereferenced to read members (cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num) and the pointer itself is not assigned to or changed \u2014 modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule. \u2022 The checks and early return (if (irq < ...), if (irq >= ...)) only read parameters. \u2022 The calls to atomic_store(&metal_softirq_enabled[irq], ...) modify elements of a global array, not the function parameters themselves. \u2022 The parameter 'enable' is only read (compared to METAL_IRQ_ENABLE) and not modified. Therefore no other fragments need investigation under Rule 17.8."
