  "explanation": "1) struct metal_irq_controller (complete definition): The parameter 'cntr' is a pointer to this structure. To decide whether 'cntr' can/should be a pointer-to-const you must know the exact member types and any existing const/volatile qualifiers (irq_base, irq_num types, or members that require mutation). The full struct shows whether the function would be attempting to modify any member (or if members are themselves non\u2011const pointers/atomic/volatile), which affects whether adding const is permissible.\n\n2) metal_softirq_enabled (definition/declaration and element type/qualifiers): The code takes the address of an element of this global and passes it to atomic_store. You need its declaration to know the element type and any qualifiers (const/volatile/_Atomic). This determines whether the pointer argument passed to atomic_store must be non-const (it is being written) and therefore whether any const qualification in this function would be inconsistent with that usage.\n\n3) atomic_store (declaration/prototype / header): The parameter type(s) of atomic_store dictate whether the address passed must be a pointer to a mutable atomic type (i.e. non-const). Knowing its prototype lets you confirm that atomic_store requires a non-const pointer and therefore that the pointer expression &metal_softirq_enabled[irq] cannot be to const \u2014 relevant to assessing pointer-to-const requirements in this function.\n\n4) The atomic type(s) used for metal_softirq_enabled (e.g. _Atomic<int> / atomic_int typedefs): If metal_softirq_enabled uses a specific _Atomic type or typedef, you must know that type to interpret atomic_store's parameter type correctly and to see whether the element type already has qualifiers that affect constness.\n\n5) METAL_IRQ_ENABLE (macro/definition): Although not directly related to pointer constness, knowing this macro's value confirms control-flow paths taken in the function (which branches perform atomic writes). This helps verify whether any path would require mutation through pointers (and thus prohibit const qualification)."
