  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains only parameter checks, integer comparisons/arithmetics, and a plain return; none of those are function calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion. The METAL_IRQ_ENABLE token is a compile-time macro (defined as 1U) and not a function. There are no function-pointer dereferences, no other function calls, and no calls to metal_softirq_set_enable itself in the shown fragment, so no other code fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 17.2."
