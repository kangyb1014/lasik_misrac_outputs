  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_get_controller:\n```c\nstatic struct metal_irq_controller *metal_irq_get_controller(int irq)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tint irq_base, irq_end;\n\n\t\tcntr = (struct metal_irq_controller *)\n\t\t       metal_container_of(node, struct metal_irq_controller,\n\t\t\t\t\t  node);\n\t\tirq_base = cntr->irq_base;\n\t\tirq_end = irq_base + cntr->irq_num;\n\t\tif (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end) {\n\t\t\treturn cntr;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tint irq_base, irq_end;\n\n\t\tcntr = (struct metal_irq_controller *)\n\t\t       metal_container_of(node, struct metal_irq_controller,\n\t\t\t\t\t  node);\n\t\tirq_base = cntr->irq_base;\n\t\tirq_end = irq_base + cntr->irq_num;\n\t\tif (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end) {\n\t\t\treturn cntr;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the iteration uses a single loop counter (node) provided by the metal_list_for_each macro. The body only reads node (via metal_container_of) and assigns local temporaries (cntr, irq_base, irq_end); it does not modify the loop counter nor any object used in the loop condition. Assuming the usual expansion of metal_list_for_each to something like for (node = head->next; node != &head; node = node->next), the first clause initializes the loop counter, the second clause tests the loop counter without persistent side effects, and the third clause updates only the loop counter. Thus Rule 14.2 is satisfied. (If the macro expanded differently \u2014 e.g. used objects that are modified in the loop body or introduced side effects in the condition/update clauses \u2014 then a violation could occur.)"
