The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each (macro): The for loop in the target function is written using this macro. To determine the three clauses of the for statement (initialization, condition, iteration) and whether the loop counter is well-formed or has side effects, you must inspect the macro expansion. The expansion shows which object(s) are used as the loop counter, how they are initialized, and how they are updated.\n- metal_container_of (macro): This macro is invoked inside the loop body and may expand to pointer arithmetic or other operations. MISRA requires that the behaviour of any functions/macros called within the for statement be considered part of the loop body. You must inspect this macro to confirm it does not modify the loop counter or any object used in the loop condition.\n- metal_list_entry / metal_container_of helper macros (if separate): Many list-for-each idioms use auxiliary macros (e.g., metal_list_entry) that are used by metal_list_for_each or metal_container_of. Include these to fully expand and reason about any hidden side effects or additional object uses.\n- struct metal_list (definition including next/prev members): The for-each macro likely iterates using the list node pointers (e.g., node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next). You must know the exact member names (next/prev) and types to determine which object is the loop counter and whether those members are modified in the loop body.\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition including fields: node, irq_base, irq_num): The loop body uses metal_container_of to obtain the enclosing irq controller and then reads irq_base and irq_num. You must see the layout and types of these members to check whether accessing them could modify the loop counter or any object used in the loop condition, and to ensure no unintended modifications occur.\n- irq_cntrs (declaration / definition of the list head): The loop condition likely compares the iterator against the list head (e.g., node != &irq_cntrs). You must know the declaration and whether irq_cntrs could be modified inside the loop body (directly or via called macros) because MISRA forbids objects used in the loop condition from being modified in the loop body."
