First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Rule 14.2 concerns the structure of the for statement and the loop counter. The only code fragments that can affect compliance are the loop counter declaration and the for loop itself (here implemented via the macro metal_list_for_each). The macro expansion determines the three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) and must be inspected for: single loop-counter usage, absence of persistent side effects in the condition, and that the increment expression modifies only the loop counter. Other lines in the function (declaration of cntr, irq_base/irq_end, the assignments, the if test and the return) are ordinary statements in the loop body and are not themselves part of the for-statement clauses; they do not alter the structure of the for statement and therefore do not need to be separately flagged for Rule 14.2. (Note: the macro expansion and any macros/functions used inside the body should be examined by investigators \u2014 the provided suspicious fragments include the macro usage so that expansion can be checked.)"
