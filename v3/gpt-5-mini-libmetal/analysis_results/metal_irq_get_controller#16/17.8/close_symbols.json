  "explanation": "To determine whether the parameter 'irq' is modified inside metal_irq_get_controller you must inspect any macros and globals used by that function and the layout/types they access:\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): This loop macro is the surrounding control structure. Its expansion could contain assignments or identifiers that (accidentally) modify a function parameter or introduce a name collision. You must see the exact macro expansion to be sure it does not write to 'irq'.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): This macro performs pointer arithmetic/casts to obtain the containing struct. Its expansion must be checked for any side effects or unexpected token pasting that might assign to an identifier named 'irq'.\n\n- irq_cntrs (global variable): The list head passed into metal_list_for_each. If irq_cntrs is a macro or has unusual semantics (e.g., an lvalue macro that expands to code that writes to identifiers), that could affect whether 'irq' is modified. Confirm its declaration/definition.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (type and definition): The function reads cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num. You must inspect the struct to ensure these members are ordinary integer members (and not, for example, bit-field macros or accessors that expand to code that could modify 'irq'), and to rule out aliasing/overlap with the local parameter.\n\n- struct metal_list (type and definition): The loop variable 'node' is a pointer to this type. Its definition may affect the expansion of metal_list_for_each or metal_container_of; confirm it contains no weird operator overloads/macro shims.\n\n- definitions/types of irq_base and irq_num: The concrete types and any accessor macros for these members must be checked to ensure reading them does not invoke code that writes to 'irq' (for example, if they are macros or inline functions rather than plain fields).\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro expansions and type definitions) is sufficient to prove whether the integer parameter 'irq' is ever assigned or otherwise modified inside the function body, as required by the MISRA rule."
