  "explanation": "No other code constructs in the provided snippet exhibit typical forms of unreachable code (e.g., code after a return, break, goto to a later label, unconditional infinite loops, or mutually exclusive conditional branches that make certain statements impossible to reach). All statements within the snippet are sequential and syntactically reachable. The local variable is used, and there are no labels, conditional compilations, or early exits within the shown fragment that would make parts of it unreachable. Therefore, no additional fragments from this snippet require investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the code shown."
