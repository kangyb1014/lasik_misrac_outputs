  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect recursion. The only fragments that can introduce such recursion are the function calls inside handle_req_headers_no_space, so both calls must be investigated to see whether they (directly or indirectly) call handle_req_headers_no_space. Other parts of the function (the static void signature, parameter list, local variable declaration, and the error-string constant) do not perform function calls and therefore cannot create recursion and do not need further investigation."
