  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are manifestly unreachable in this function. Reasoning: \n\n- There are no unconditional branches (no return, break, continue, goto, or infinite loops) before the end of the function that would make subsequent statements unreachable. The function proceeds linearly to the final free(connection). \n\n- The mhd_assert calls may abort at runtime if an assertion fails, but they are conditional checks (they do not unconditionally transfer control away) and therefore do not create statically unreachable code. Whether an assertion handler terminates the program is a runtime behavior, not a compile-time unreachable-code violation under Rule 2.1. \n\n- Preprocessor-guarded blocks (#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT, #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT) are conditional inclusions, not unreachable code: when the relevant macros are defined those blocks are compiled and can be reached at runtime; when not defined they are simply not part of the translation unit. That is expected and not a Rule 2.1 violation by itself. \n\n- Calls such as gnutls_deinit, MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_ip_limit_del and free are ordinary function calls; none are shown as unconditionally non-returning in the provided code. If any of those functions were implemented elsewhere as non-returning (noreturn), that should be checked in their implementations or declarations, but there is no evidence in this fragment that they render subsequent code unreachable.\n\nTherefore, no fragments in this function need further investigation specifically for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want, I can also check related function declarations/macros (mhd_assert, MHD_socket_close_chk_, gnutls_deinit) to ensure none are specified as non-returning or implemented in a way that would create unreachable code here."
