Therefore this fragment can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 unless the project documents/justifies the assertion or ensures it is not compiled as an always\u2011executed no\u2011op. Note: exact determination requires inspection of the mhd_assert macro definition and build/configuration (debug vs release).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's scenario is plausible but not proven. To claim a Rule 2.2 violation you must show that the executed operation can be removed without changing program behaviour. That requires knowing how mhd_assert is defined and used in the build: if mhd_assert aborts on failure or performs other actions, it is not dead; if it is compiled out or reduced to a pure, side\u2011effect\u2011free no\u2011op that always evaluates a tautology, removal might be considered dead only if it also does not affect timing or other observable behaviour. Given only the snippet, we cannot determine those facts. Therefore the report as stated is not definitively correct \u2014 it is a plausible concern that requires inspection of the mhd_assert macro and the build/configuration (and consideration of timing effects) before declaring a Rule 2.2 violation."
