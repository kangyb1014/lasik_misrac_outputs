The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of new_connection_close_:\n```c\nstatic void\nnew_connection_close_ (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                       struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  mhd_assert (connection->daemon == daemon);\n  mhd_assert (! connection->in_cleanup);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->next);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->nextX);\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->nextE);\n#endif /* EPOLL_SUPPORT */\n\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  if (NULL != connection->tls_session)\n  {\n    mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n    gnutls_deinit (connection->tls_session);\n  }\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  MHD_socket_close_chk_ (connection->socket_fd);\n  MHD_ip_limit_del (daemon,\n                    connection->addr,\n                    connection->addr_len);\n  if (NULL != connection->addr)\n    free (connection->addr);\n  free (connection);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (NULL == connection->nextX);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If mhd_assert is implemented as a diagnostic assertion with no side effects on program state (the usual pattern: it evaluates the condition and aborts on failure, but otherwise does nothing), then the statement mhd_assert(NULL == connection->nextX); constitutes dead code in normal (non\u2011failing) operation: the check is executed but its removal (when the condition is always true at runtime) would not affect program behaviour. Therefore this fragment can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 unless the project documents/justifies the assertion or ensures it is not compiled as an always\u2011executed no\u2011op. Note: exact determination requires inspection of the mhd_assert macro definition and build/configuration (debug vs release)."
