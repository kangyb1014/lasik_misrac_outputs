In builds where mhd_assert expands to code that merely evaluates the condition and possibly logs/aborts on failure, the evaluation itself does not change program state or I/O; removing that assertion would not alter the program\u2019s functional behaviour (only the presence of the diagnostic). Therefore the assertion constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert performs observable side effects or the expression reads volatile/memory-mapped state, then it would not be dead.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. You cannot conclude a Rule 2.2 violation from the snippet alone because the status of mhd_assert is implementation-defined. Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed yet whose removal would not change program behaviour; whether an assertion is such an operation depends on what the macro expands to. An assertion can have observable effects (calling abort/exit, logging, invoking error handlers, touching volatile/memory-mapped state, etc.), and its presence can change program behaviour on invariant violations (which is relevant for safety). Without the definition of mhd_assert (or knowledge that it is a guaranteed, side\u2011effect\u2011free no\u2011op in all builds), you cannot claim the assertion is dead code. Therefore the agent\u2019s claim (as stated) is not justified."
