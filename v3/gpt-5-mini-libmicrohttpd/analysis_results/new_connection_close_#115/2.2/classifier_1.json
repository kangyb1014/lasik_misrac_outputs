The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of new_connection_close_:\n```c\nstatic void\nnew_connection_close_ (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                       struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  mhd_assert (connection->daemon == daemon);\n  mhd_assert (! connection->in_cleanup);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->next);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->nextX);\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  mhd_assert (NULL == connection->nextE);\n#endif /* EPOLL_SUPPORT */\n\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  if (NULL != connection->tls_session)\n  {\n    mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n    gnutls_deinit (connection->tls_session);\n  }\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  MHD_socket_close_chk_ (connection->socket_fd);\n  MHD_ip_limit_del (daemon,\n                    connection->addr,\n                    connection->addr_len);\n  if (NULL != connection->addr)\n    free (connection->addr);\n  free (connection);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (! connection->in_cleanup);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The mhd_assert line is an assertion/check: in builds where mhd_assert performs a runtime check (e.g. aborts or logs when the condition is false) its removal would change program behaviour when connection->in_cleanup is true, so it is not dead code. If mhd_assert is compiled out (expands to no code) then the statement is simply not executed (and per MISRA Note 2 that is not \"dead code\" because dead code must be executed yet removable without effect). Only in the (unlikely) case that mhd_assert executes and has no observable effect and the condition has no side effects would this be a violation; with a normal assertion implementation this fragment does not violate Rule 2.2."
