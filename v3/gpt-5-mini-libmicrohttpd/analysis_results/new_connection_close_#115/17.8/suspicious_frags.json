  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the parameter variables (the pointer values) themselves, while allowing modification of the objects they point to. In the provided function there are no assignments, increments/decrements, or operations that use the parameter identifiers as l-values (no code like \"daemon = ...\" or \"connection = ...\"). All uses are either reads of the pointers, dereferences of the pointed-to objects (connection->...), calls that receive the pointer by value, or freeing the pointed-to object (free(connection)), which is permitted because it modifies the object referred to, not the pointer parameter itself. Therefore no fragments in this function violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
