  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. The file only contains standard C constructs: a static function definition, pointer parameters to structs, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#endif), normal function calls, standard logical/bitwise expressions, pointer comparisons, free(), and return-freeing of allocated memory. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly (asm), GCC nested functions, variably modified types in file scope, or other vendor-specific keywords. Macros referenced (mhd_assert, MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_ip_limit_del) and external library calls (gnutls_deinit) could internally use extensions, but those definitions are not present in this fragment \u2014 their usage here is just normal function/macro invocation and does not itself prove use of a language extension. Therefore no code fragments from this snippet require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
