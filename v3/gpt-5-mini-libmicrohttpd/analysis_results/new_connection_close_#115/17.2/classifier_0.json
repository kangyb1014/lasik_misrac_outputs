  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement mhd_assert(NULL == connection->nextX); is just an assertion (a macro invocation) that checks pointer equality. In the provided code there is no direct or indirect call to new_connection_close_ caused by this line, so Rule 17.2 is not violated. (Only if mhd_assert were defined to call new_connection_close_ would an indirect recursion be possible, but there is no evidence of that here.)"
