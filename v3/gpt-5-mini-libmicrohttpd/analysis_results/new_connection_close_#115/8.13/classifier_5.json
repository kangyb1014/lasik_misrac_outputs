  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation for this fragment: the statement merely compares two pointer values and does not violate Rule 8.13 by itself. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (they should point to const-qualified types when appropriate). From this single line we cannot tell whether the field 'daemon' in struct MHD_Connection is incorrectly declared non-const. If that field is declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' but the connection never modifies the pointed-to daemon through that pointer, then the declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'."
