  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment uses only standard C constructs and common library/POSIX calls: function definition with a void* return, pointer parameters, malloc (C library), struct timeval and gettimeofday (POSIX API), and the (void)parameter idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings. There are no compiler-specific extensions such as GCC __attribute__ or __builtin__ constructs, nested functions, statement-expressions, typeof, inline assembly, nonstandard type keywords, or other features listed as compiler extensions in vendor documentation. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language compiler extensions)."
