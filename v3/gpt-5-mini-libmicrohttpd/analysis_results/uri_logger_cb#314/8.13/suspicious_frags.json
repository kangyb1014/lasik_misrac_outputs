  "explanation": "The other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the local pointer \"tv\" (struct timeval *tv = malloc (sizeof (struct timeval));) is written to by gettimeofday() and therefore must be a mutable (non-const) pointer; the parameter \"uri\" is already declared as const char * and thus complies with the rule; the call to malloc and the subsequent return of the allocated pointer are standard allocation/usage patterns where the pointed-to object is intended to be modified (as evidenced by gettimeofday), so making those pointers const would be inappropriate. Therefore only the function-level pointer types (the void* parameter and/or return) and the explicit unused-parameter line merit investigation regarding possible const-qualification."
