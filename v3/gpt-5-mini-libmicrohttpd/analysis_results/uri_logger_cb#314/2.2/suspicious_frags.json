The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining statements should not be investigated for Rule 2.2: \n- struct timeval *tv = malloc (sizeof (struct timeval));  -> Allocating memory is an observable effect (heap state change) and its removal would change program behaviour.\n- if (NULL != tv) gettimeofday (tv, NULL);  -> The call to gettimeofday produces observable side effects (populates the allocated object with the current time); removing it would change program behaviour.\n- return tv;  -> Returning the allocated pointer is part of the function\u2019s observable contract; removing the return (or altering it) would change behaviour.\n- The function itself is reachable and executed; unreachable-code considerations (note 2) do not apply here.\nTherefore only the two explicit (void) casts are plausible dead-code candidates to investigate under Rule 2.2."
