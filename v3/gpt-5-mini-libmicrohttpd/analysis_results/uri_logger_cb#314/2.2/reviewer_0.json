Therefore this statement constitutes dead code in uri_logger_cb and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statements are a deliberate, idiomatic way to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although the expression statement (void) cls; has no runtime effect and its removal would not change program behaviour in the narrow sense, MISRA\u2019s concern about \u201cdead code\u201d is to avoid redundant or misleading code that could hide faults; an explicit void-cast is a documented, intentional annotation of intent rather than accidental dead code. In practice MISRA guidance accepts this idiom for unused parameters (or, alternatively, the parameter name can be omitted where allowed). Therefore the agent A claim that uri_logger_cb violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
