  "explanation": "The provided MHD_run function contains no use of memcmp or any other standard library string-comparison functions, and it performs no operations on char pointers or null-terminated strings. The code only tests a boolean/flag (daemon->shutdown) and a macro/function-like predicate (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon)), calls MHD_run_wait (result explicitly discarded), and returns enum values. There are no char arrays, no string literals being compared, and no calls to memcmp in this fragment. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If macro expansions or the internals of MHD_run_wait or MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ are of concern, those definitions are not present in the provided code and would need to be inspected separately.)"
