  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this code fragment with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The function does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The only operations are: reading boolean-like fields from the daemon pointer (daemon->shutdown), evaluating a macro MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon), and calling MHD_run_wait(daemon, 0). There is no pointer arithmetic, no array or buffer accesses, and no use of standard string functions in the shown code. Note: the call to MHD_run_wait is present but its implementation is not shown here; if that function uses <string.h> functions, it must be reviewed separately."
