  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve function calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 17.2: - daemon->shutdown is a field access, not a function call. - The return statements (return MHD_NO; return MHD_YES;) are simple returns of an enum/result value as shown and do not call functions. - The function prologue/braces and casts (e.g. the (void) cast applied to the call) are syntactic elements and do not introduce calls. The three listed fragments are the only places in this code where a function-like entity is invoked or a function is declared and therefore are the only parts that could create direct or indirect self-calls to examine further."
