  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) is a predicate-like macro or accessor (likely testing a flag in the daemon structure) and does not call MHD_run. There is no evidence that it expands to, or invokes, MHD_run (directly or indirectly). Only if MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ were implemented to call MHD_run would Rule 17.2 be violated \u2014 which is not the case here."
