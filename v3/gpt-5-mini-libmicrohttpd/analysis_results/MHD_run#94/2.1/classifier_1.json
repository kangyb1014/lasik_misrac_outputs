  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The return statement would be unreachable if the called function MHD_run_wait is known never to return (for example, it is implemented as an infinite loop, it always calls exit/abort/longjmp, or its prototype/attribute marks it as noreturn). In that case the trailing `return MHD_YES;` can never be executed and thus would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
