  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments involve a pointer to struct MHD_Daemon. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns adding const qualification to pointer target types where possible; therefore only code that creates or passes the daemon pointer (function parameter, member access, macro usage, and the call that passes it) needs investigation. Other lines (returns of MHD_NO/MHD_YES, the cast of the function result to void, braces and control structure syntax) do not declare or pass pointer types and so are not relevant to this rule."
