  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_run:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  if ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  (void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_YES;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement 'return MHD_YES;' is executed on the non-shutdown, non-threaded path of MHD_run. Removing it would change the function's observable behaviour (the caller would no longer receive MHD_YES), so it is not an operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
