  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_run:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  if ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  (void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment alone. The conditional return affects control flow and is not, by itself, dead code. A violation would only occur in a specific project configuration \u2014 for example, if daemon->shutdown is known (statically or by project-wide invariants) to be always false and MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) is an always-return-0 function (not a compile-time constant) with no side effects, then the call to MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) would be executed but its removal would not change program behaviour (dead code). In the absence of such evidence, Rule 2.2 is not violated."
