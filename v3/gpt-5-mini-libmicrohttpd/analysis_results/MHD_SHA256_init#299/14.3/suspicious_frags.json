  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the provided function. The body contains only assignment statements that initialize array elements and a count member; there are no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) operators or other constructs that introduce a controlling expression. The use of UINT32_C(...) macros yields constant operands for assignments but these are not controlling expressions and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no fragments in this code that require investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
