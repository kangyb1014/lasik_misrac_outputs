  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code fragment. The function only performs direct assignments to struct members (ctx->H[0] .. ctx->H[7] and ctx->count = 0) and does not call memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string handling routine. There is no pointer-parameter-based buffer manipulation or copying that could result in out-of-bounds accesses related to the string.h APIs covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so no fragments need investigation for that rule."
