  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided fragment. Specific reasoning:\n\n- Function definition and prototype (static void MHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)): standard C function declaration/definition syntax, not an extension.\n- mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);: this is a macro invocation. The macro name itself is not a language extension. Without the macro definition in this fragment there is no evidence it expands to a compiler-specific extension; therefore it does not by itself warrant reporting.\n- Preprocessor conditional (#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) ... #else ... #endif): conditional compilation is standard C preprocessor usage, not a language extension.\n- MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);: a normal function call; the identifier name is not an extension. There is no use of compiler-specific keywords (for example __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, __builtin_*, _Pragma, or other documented compiler extensions).\n- (void) daemon;: explicit cast to void to silence unused-parameter warnings is standard C practice, not an extension.\n\nIf any of the macros or functions used here (mhd_assert, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, or the MHD_USE_* macros) are defined elsewhere using compiler-specific extensions, those definitions would need to be inspected. However, based solely on this code fragment there are no language extensions to report."
