  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) occur in the provided function. The code only calls mhd_assert, conditionally calls MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex) (a mutex-unlock helper) and otherwise casts daemon to void. There are no buffer accesses, pointer arithmetic, or string handling operations in this fragment that could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
