  "explanation": "I have reported every conditional branch and their bodies that could potentially be unreachable depending on the return values of the external functions (get_cpu_core_count and mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count) or on assumed invariants. These are the only places in the function where control flow can skip or enter blocks; they should be investigated to ensure none of them are provably unreachable under the project's assumptions.\n\nOther fragments were not reported because they do not constitute unreachable code: variable declarations and simple assignments (sys_cpu_cores = get_cpu_core_count(); res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count(); num_proc_cpu_cores = ...), the final return, and the printf/fprintf calls themselves (outside the conditional branches already listed) are reachable as part of the listed branches. There are no statements after a return, no constant-conditional constructs, no dead labels/gotos, and no other obvious syntactic dead code in the function, so no further fragments need investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1."
