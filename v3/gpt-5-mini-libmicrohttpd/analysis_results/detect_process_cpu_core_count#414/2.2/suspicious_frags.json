  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not reported because they are directly involved in control flow, state determination or required assignments and therefore unlikely to be dead code: - The calls to get_cpu_core_count() and mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count() produce data used in subsequent logic. Removing them would change program behaviour. - The assignments to num_proc_cpu_cores in each branch and the final return statement determine the function result; these cannot be removed without changing behavior. - The conditional test on res (res < 0) and the assignment num_proc_cpu_cores = (unsigned int) res in the success branch are core logic. - Variable declarations and the function signature are structurally necessary. The listed suspicious fragments are primarily logging/diagnostic output and the conditional block that clamps num_proc_cpu_cores to sys_cpu_cores; these should be investigated to determine whether any of those executed operations are redundant (i.e. their removal would not affect required program behaviour) and thus could constitute dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
