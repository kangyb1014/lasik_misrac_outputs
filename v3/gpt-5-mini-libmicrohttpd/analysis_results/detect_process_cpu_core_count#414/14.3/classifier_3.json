  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression '1 != sys_cpu_cores' is not invariant because sys_cpu_cores is assigned at runtime by get_cpu_core_count(), so the expression can evaluate differently at runtime. The Rule 14.3 exceptions for intentional invariants do not apply here. (If sys_cpu_cores were a compile-time constant equal to 1, the expression would be invariant and violate the rule.)"
