  "explanation": "I selected all controlling expressions present in the function: the four if conditions and the conditional operator used inside printf. Other parts of the code (variable declarations, assignments, function calls, fprintf/printf calls, the final return) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 14.3. There are no for/while/do-while loops, no switch controlling expressions, and no obvious integer constant expressions used as loop/conditional controls beyond the listed fragments, so no additional fragments need investigation."
