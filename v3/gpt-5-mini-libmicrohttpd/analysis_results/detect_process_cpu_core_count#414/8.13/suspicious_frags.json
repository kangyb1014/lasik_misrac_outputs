  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer expressions appear in this function that could be checked against MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specific reasoning:\n\n- There are no pointer variable declarations or pointer parameters in detect_process_cpu_core_count; all local variables are integer types (unsigned int, int).\n- Calls to get_cpu_core_count() and mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count() are assigned to integer variables. Their return types (used here) are integer, not pointers, so there is no pointer target to const-qualify.\n- The only uses that involve pointer-typed entities are standard I/O stream objects (stderr, stdout via printf/fprintf) and string literals. String literals have type const char[] and are passed to printf/fprintf which expect const char * for the format \u2014 this already satisfies const qualification. The FILE * stream objects (stderr) cannot be const-qualified in this context because they represent mutable I/O objects; making them const would be inappropriate and unrelated to Rule 8.13\u2019s intent.\n- There is a numeric cast (unsigned int) res, which is not pointer-related.\n\nBecause there are no pointer targets in this code fragment that could or should be const-qualified, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 8.13."
