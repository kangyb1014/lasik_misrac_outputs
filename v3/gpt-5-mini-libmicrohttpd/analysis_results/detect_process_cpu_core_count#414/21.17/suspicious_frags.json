  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the supplied function. The function only performs integer operations, assignments, comparisons, casts, and calls to fprintf/printf and two helper functions (get_cpu_core_count, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count). fprintf/printf are I/O functions from <stdio.h>, not string handling routines from <string.h>, and the format strings used are string literals (no runtime buffer copies or pointer arithmetic). There are no buffer accesses, no pointer parameters passed to string.h functions, and no use of the listed APIs that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 21.17."
