  "explanation": "This function has no parameters (detect_process_cpu_core_count(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable here. All variables in the fragment are local (num_proc_cpu_cores, sys_cpu_cores, res) and may be assigned/modified without violating Rule 17.8. Calls to get_cpu_core_count() and mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count() are invoked with no arguments; any parameter handling inside those functions is outside the provided code and would need review in their own definitions. The printf/fprintf calls and the cast (unsigned int)res do not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
