  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 because: - The equality check (header_len == pos->header_size) appears before the MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ call in the same && expression; due to C\u2019s left-to-right, short-circuit evaluation, the length check prevents calling the comparison when sizes differ, avoiding a potential out-of-bounds read of pos->header. Also the (header == pos->header) branch prevents the function call when the pointers are identical. - The pos->kind test and loop traversal use simple integer and pointer operations that do not invoke <string.h> functions and do not by themselves cause string-buffer accesses. - No other direct uses of standard <string.h> functions appear in this function. Therefore the only places that warrant further inspection for possible accesses beyond object bounds are the two calls to the custom string helpers (which may internally call string.h routines) and the initial header[0]/token[0] accesses (which read characters and may interact with the helper calls' expectations about null-termination/length)."
