  "explanation": "Only function calls inside MHD_lookup_header_token_ci can introduce direct or indirect recursion. The two helper calls shown above are the only function calls in this function body and therefore must be investigated to determine whether they (directly or indirectly) call MHD_lookup_header_token_ci. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the function does not call itself directly anywhere; the for-loop and pointer traversals (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; pos = pos->next) are simple data accesses/assignments, the initial NULL/empty checks and return statements are not function calls, and there are no other function-call expressions in this function that could participate in recursion."
