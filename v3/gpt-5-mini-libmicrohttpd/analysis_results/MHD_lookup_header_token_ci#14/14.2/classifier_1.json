  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\n```c\nstatic bool\nMHD_lookup_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            const char *header,\n                            size_t header_len,\n                            const char *token,\n                            size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) ||\n      (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0]))\n    return false;\n\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((0 != (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND)) &&\n        (header_len == pos->header_size) &&\n        ( (header == pos->header) ||\n          (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (header,\n                                          pos->header,\n                                          header_len)) ) &&\n        (MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value, token, token_len)))\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value, token, token_len)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call MHD_str_has_token_caseless_(pos->value, token, token_len) appears inside the for-loop body, not in any of the three for-statement clauses. Rule 14.2 restricts what may appear in the for header (initialization, condition and iteration expressions) and requires that the loop counter not be modified by the loop body (including called functions). As written the for header is well-formed (pos is the single loop counter, condition is NULL != pos, iteration is pos = pos->next) and the fragment is merely a function call that reads pos->value. This does not by itself violate Rule 14.2. The only way this fragment would cause a 14.2 violation is if MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ had persistent side-effects that modify the loop counter or objects used in the for clauses (for example, if it modified pos or pos->next). Given the fragment alone, no violation is present."
