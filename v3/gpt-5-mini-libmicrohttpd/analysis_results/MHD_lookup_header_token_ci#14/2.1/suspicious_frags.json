  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified. The function\u2019s early-return guard can legitimately return false; the for-loop may execute zero or more iterations; the return true inside the loop is reachable when a matching header is found; the final return false is reachable when no match is found. There are no statements following unconditional returns that would be dead, nor any mutually-exclusive conditions that make a branch impossible to reach. The use of || and && relies on C\u2019s well-defined short-circuit evaluation, so pointer comparisons (header == pos->header) prevent evaluating the string-compare when appropriate. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to be unreachable and requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
