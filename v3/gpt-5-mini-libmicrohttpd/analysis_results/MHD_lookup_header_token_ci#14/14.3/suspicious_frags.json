  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found in the function. Specifically:\n- The initial if condition (if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) || (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0])) ...) depends on the function parameters and is not constant.\n- The for loop (for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)) uses NULL != pos as the loop condition but pos is updated each iteration (pos = pos->next), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- The inner if condition ((0 != (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND)) && (header_len == pos->header_size) && ((header == pos->header) || (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_(...))) && (MHD_str_has_token_caseless_(...))) depends on pos and the input parameters and is therefore not invariant.\n- There are no while(1), for(;;), do-while with constant true/false, or other constant controlling expressions present.\nGiven the above, no code fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function and there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to investigate."
