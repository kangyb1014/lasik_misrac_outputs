  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\n```c\nstatic bool\nMHD_lookup_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            const char *header,\n                            size_t header_len,\n                            const char *token,\n                            size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) ||\n      (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0]))\n    return false;\n\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((0 != (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND)) &&\n        (header_len == pos->header_size) &&\n        ( (header == pos->header) ||\n          (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (header,\n                                          pos->header,\n                                          header_len)) ) &&\n        (MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value, token, token_len)))\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation. The for-loop init and iteration (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next) are used to traverse the linked list of received headers; removing the loop would change program behaviour (it would skip all header checks/returns). Even if headers_received is often NULL (so the body is not entered), the loop construct is still required to implement the traversal and is not dead code under MISRA 2.2."
