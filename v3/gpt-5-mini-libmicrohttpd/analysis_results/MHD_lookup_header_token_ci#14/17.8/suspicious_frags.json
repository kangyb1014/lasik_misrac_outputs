  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameter 'connection' is only dereferenced (connection->rq.headers_received) \u2014 it is not assigned to or changed.\n- The pointer parameters 'header' and 'token' are only read (checked for NULL and checked header[0]/token[0]) and passed to helper functions; they are not reassigned or modified.\n- The size parameters 'header_len' and 'token_len' are only used for comparisons and are not modified.\n- The loop uses a local variable 'pos' which is assigned and updated (pos = pos->next); this is a local variable, not a parameter.\n- No assignment, increment/decrement, or pointer arithmetic is performed on any parameter variable.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (modifying function parameters)."
