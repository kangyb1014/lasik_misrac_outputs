  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains only assertions, preprocessor conditionals, an unreachable assertion, and a debug flag assignment; none of those lines invoke string.h functions or perform pointer/length-based memory accesses that fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The casts of data to (const uint8_t *) and the conditional tests on da->algo do not by themselves perform memory accesses beyond object bounds. Therefore only the explicit calls to the update functions need investigation, since those functions receive a pointer and a length and may internally call string.h routines (memcpy/memmove/memset/etc.) or otherwise access the buffer; their use is the only part of this code that could produce accesses beyond the bounds of the object referenced by the pointer parameters."
