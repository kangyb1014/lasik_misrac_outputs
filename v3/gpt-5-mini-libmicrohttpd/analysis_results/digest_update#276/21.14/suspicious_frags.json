  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) in the provided digest_update function. The code only calls internal update routines (MHD_MD5_update, MHD_SHA256_update, MHD_SHA512_256_update) with a data pointer and an explicit length, which indicates binary-buffer processing rather than comparisons of null-terminated strings. There are no expressions comparing char buffers or pointers that would suggest a memcmp-based string comparison. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you want a deeper check, provide the implementations of the called update functions and any macros to verify they themselves do not call memcmp on null-terminated strings."
