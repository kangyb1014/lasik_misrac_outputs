  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected all statements and conditional blocks that could conceal executed-but-removable operations or logic that makes code obsolete depending on build-time options: the initial precondition checks, each algorithm-selection/update branch (including the surrounding #ifdef blocks), the final impossible-case assertion, and the debug-only assignment. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the function signature and parameter declarations, the casts (const uint8_t *) data, the surrounding braces and comments are syntactic elements and not executed operations; the use of preprocessor directives themselves is a compile-time inclusion mechanism (the fragments above already cover the conditional branches that matter at runtime); and trivial formatting/comments (e.g. /* May not happen */) have no runtime effect. These remaining elements therefore are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2 and do not need further investigation."
