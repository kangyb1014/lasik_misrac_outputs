  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in this function: there are no if, switch, for, while or do-while statements whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The function only calls library functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) and returns a result; any loops or conditionals would be inside those functions (out of scope). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
