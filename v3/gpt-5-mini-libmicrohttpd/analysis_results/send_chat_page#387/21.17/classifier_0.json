  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Calling strlen(CHAT_PAGE) is only safe if CHAT_PAGE points to a null\u2011terminated character array. If CHAT_PAGE is not guaranteed to contain a '\\0' within its object bounds (for example if it is a pointer to a buffer with an explicit length but missing NUL, or if it was produced/filled without ensuring termination), strlen will scan past the buffer and access memory beyond the object. In that case the use of strlen violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
