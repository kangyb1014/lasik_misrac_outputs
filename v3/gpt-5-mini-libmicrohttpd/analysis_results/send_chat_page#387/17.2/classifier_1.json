  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment calls MHD_queue_response, an external library function; send_chat_page does not call itself. A Rule 17.2 violation would occur only if there were a call cycle (for example, if MHD_queue_response or some callback it invokes called back into send_chat_page, creating an indirect recursion). There is no evidence of such a call chain in the provided code, so the rule is not violated."
