  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call MHD_destroy_response(res) simply calls another library function and does not call send_chat_page. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if MHD_destroy_response called send_chat_page either directly or indirectly (for example by invoking a callback or processing path that re-enters send_chat_page). There is no evidence of such recursion in the provided code fragment."
