  "explanation": "The function body contains no direct call to itself, so there is no direct recursion in this fragment. The only function calls other than the callee are to standard library strlen(), which cannot cause recursion back into this function. The linkage specifier/macro (_MHD_EXTERN), parameter list, and conditional operators are unrelated to Rule 17.2. The only potential for indirect recursion is via the called function named in the returned call; to determine compliance with Rule 17.2 that callee (and any functions it calls) must be inspected. No other fragments in this code excerpt can introduce direct or indirect self-calls to MHD_set_connection_value."
