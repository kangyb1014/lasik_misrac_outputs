  "explanation": "Only the calls to the string handling function strlen appear in this function. These expressions must be investigated to ensure the pointers (key, value) refer to objects that are null-terminated and that calling strlen cannot read beyond the objects' bounds. Other parts of the function (signature, return, passing the pointers and computed lengths to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_) do not themselves invoke any <string.h> functions or perform operations that could directly read string contents, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
