  "explanation": "All other elements in the snippet are standard C constructs and do not indicate compiler-specific language extensions: the return type and enum usage (enum MHD_Result, enum MHD_ValueKind), the function definition and parameter list, pointer and const qualifiers (struct MHD_Connection *, const char *), the use of NULL, the conditional (?:) operator, calls to standard library function strlen, and the return statement. There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or compiler builtin names in the provided code. Therefore no other fragments need investigation."
