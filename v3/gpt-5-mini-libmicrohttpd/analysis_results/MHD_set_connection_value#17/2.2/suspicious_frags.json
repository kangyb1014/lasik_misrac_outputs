The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. The function only forwards its parameters to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ and computes the key/value lengths with conditional expressions that protect against NULL before calling strlen \u2014 these strlen calls are only evaluated when needed and their results are passed to the callee, so they affect behavior. There are no assignments, unreachable branches, no-op operations, or computations whose removal would not change program behavior. Therefore nothing in this snippet meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
