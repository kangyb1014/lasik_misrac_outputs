  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that warrant investigation for possible unreachable-code issues under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Reasons these fragments are suspicious and should be checked by other agents: - The compound early-return condition uses pointer indexing (key[0], token[0]) alongside NULL checks; although C's &&/|| short-circuiting normally prevents dereferencing NULL, verify that the exact expression order and any macro expansions cannot make those subexpressions evaluated unconditionally. - The mhd_assert call enforces an invariant (strlen(token) == token_len). Assertions may be compiled out or expand to constructs that alter control flow; if the assert is removed in some build configurations, code that relies on the invariant may effectively contain unreachable or undefined behavior. Confirm how mhd_assert is defined across builds. - The for-loop initializes pos from response->first_header but the function does not check response for NULL; dereferencing response may be undefined and could make the loop header problematic or cause dead/unreachable code in some configurations. - The large if-condition inside the loop chains several checks with short-circuit AND; some subexpressions (string-comparison and token-check functions) may be unreachable when earlier checks fail. Verify that those functions have no required side effects and that the ordering is intentional and consistent across builds. Other fragments in the function (variable declaration, the return true itself, the final return false and surrounding braces/comments) are straightforward control-flow elements and do not by themselves indicate unreachable code; they do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1 unless the above items reveal problems (for example, if response can be NULL, then the loop body and final return need re-evaluation)."
