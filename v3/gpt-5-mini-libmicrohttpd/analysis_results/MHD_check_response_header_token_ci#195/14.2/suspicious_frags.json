First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 because they do not affect the well-formedness of the for loop. The initial NULL/empty checks on key/token and the mhd_assert prior to the loop are simple expressions and do not modify the loop counter or objects used in the for clauses. The comparisons within the if (e.g. (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) and (key_len == pos->header_size)) are pure reads and do not introduce persistent side-effects relevant to the for-statement clauses. The return statements only alter control flow and do not modify the loop counter. The function signature and parameter declarations are unrelated to the for-loop clause requirements. The flagged fragments cover: the loop counter declaration (pos), the for-statement clauses (initialisation, condition, iteration expression) and the two function calls invoked inside the loop body (whose behaviors must be inspected because the rule treats called functions as part of the loop body and they could modify objects used in the for clauses)."
