  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const-qualified types where applicable or do not involve pointer-to-object qualifications: the function parameters are declared const (const struct MHD_Response *response, const char *key, const char *token), the NULL/empty checks on key and token only read through those const pointers, and strlen(token) and the called helper functions (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, MHD_str_has_token_caseless_) accept/read const char * data \u2014 so no non-const pointer-to-object is being unnecessarily used there. The only places where a pointer to a non-const type is declared or propagated from a const-qualified input (response) are the local iterator 'pos' and its subsequent uses (accessing pos->header, pos->value, pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header_size). These should be investigated to determine whether they can/should be const-qualified (for example: const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos) to comply with Rule 8.13. No other fragments in the function present pointer-to-non-const opportunities that appear to violate the rule."
