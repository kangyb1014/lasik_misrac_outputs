  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code consists of standard C constructs only: a normal function definition, standard integer/boolean types (bool, size_t), pointer and struct member access, standard control flow (if, for), string library use (strlen), macros/function calls (mhd_assert, MHD_str_*, MHD_str_has_token_*) and standard constants (NULL, '\\0'). There are no visible compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), asm, labels-as-values, vendor pragmas, or other non-standard keywords. Note: hidden expansions (e.g. if mhd_assert or the MHD_* functions/macros are implemented using compiler-specific extensions) are outside this fragment; those definitions would need to be inspected separately. Based on the shown code alone, no fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
