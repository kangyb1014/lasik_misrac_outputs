  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not involve direct use of the <string.h> string-handling functions or risky length-based memory accesses and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17. The initial NULL and empty-string checks ensure the pointers are not NULL and not empty; the loop over response->first_header is standard traversal of linked structures; the numeric comparison of key_len with pos->header_size constrains the header length on the response side; control-flow (returns, loop, and simple field accesses) do not themselves perform string operations that could read beyond object bounds. No other calls to standard string.h functions appear in this function."
