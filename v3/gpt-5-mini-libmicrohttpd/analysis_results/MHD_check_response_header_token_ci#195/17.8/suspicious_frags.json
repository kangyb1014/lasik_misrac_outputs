  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Details:\n- response: only read (accessed as response->first_header); there is no assignment to response itself and no pointer arithmetic changing the parameter.\n- key and token: only dereferenced/read (NULL checks, key[0], token[0]) and passed to other functions; the pointer variables themselves are not reassigned or incremented.\n- key_len and token_len: only read for comparisons and passed to helper functions; not modified.\n- The loop variable pos is a local pointer and is updated (pos = pos->next), not any of the function parameters.\n- The mhd_assert(strlen(token) == token_len) call reads the object pointed to by token but does not modify the token parameter itself.\n\nNote: calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ and MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ pass pointer parameters by value; whether those called functions modify the pointed-to objects is outside this function and (per MISRA Rule 17.8) modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted. There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves in this code, so no fragments require further investigation for Rule 17.8."
