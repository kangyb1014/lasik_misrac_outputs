  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp (directly or via obvious aliases/wrappers) in the provided function. The only string comparison present is strcmp (0 == strcmp(username, entry->username)), which does not violate Rule 21.14 because the rule disallows using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings \u2014 it does not forbid using strcmp. The remaining code (loop over user_ids, pointer arithmetic entry = user_ids + i, size calculation) does not involve memcmp or any other standard-library function that would trigger Rule 21.14, so there are no fragments here that need investigation for this specific rule."
