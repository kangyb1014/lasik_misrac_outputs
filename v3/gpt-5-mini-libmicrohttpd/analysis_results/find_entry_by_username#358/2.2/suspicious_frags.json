  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function appears to be dead code. Each executed operation affects the function\u2019s behaviour:\n- The for loop (i = 0; i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); ++i) controls iteration over the user_ids collection and is essential for searching.\n- The pointer declaration and assignment (struct UserEntry *entry; entry = user_ids + i;) provide access to the current element; removing them would change behaviour (though they could be written differently, they are not dead).\n- The strcmp call and the conditional (0 == strcmp(username, entry->username)) determine match and the early return; removing them would alter the function outcome.\n- The return NULL at the end is required for the no-match case.\n\nThere is no unreachable code in this snippet and no initialization-only code that would qualify as dead under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: a separate correctness concern \u2014 e.g. misuse of sizeof if user_ids is not an array \u2014 would be a different rule/issue, not dead code.)"
