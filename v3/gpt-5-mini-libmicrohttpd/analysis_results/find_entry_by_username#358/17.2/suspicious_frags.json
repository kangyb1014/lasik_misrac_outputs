  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function find_entry_by_username contains no calls to itself (directly) and makes only a single external function call: strcmp. There are no function-pointer usages, callback registrations, or other function calls in the body that could plausibly lead to indirect recursion. The loop and pointer arithmetic operate on a local index and the user_ids array but do not invoke any functions that might call back into find_entry_by_username. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self-calls)."
