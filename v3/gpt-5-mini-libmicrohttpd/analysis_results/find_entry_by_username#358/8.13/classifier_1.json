  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If struct UserEntry defines the member as a non-const character sequence (for example: `struct UserEntry { char *username; /* ... */ };` or `char username[N];`), then the expression `entry->username` decays to a `char *` and is passed read-only to `strcmp`. Because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (the data is only read), this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The member should be declared `const char *username` (or `const char username[N]`) to avoid the violation."
