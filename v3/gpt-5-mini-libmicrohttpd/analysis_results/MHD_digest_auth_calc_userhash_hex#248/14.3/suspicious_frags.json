  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The rule targets invariant controlling expressions (conditions of if/while/for/do-while that are constant). This function contains two conditional statements but neither is invariant:\n\n- if (digest_size * 2 + 1 > hex_buf_size)\n  - digest_size is obtained at run-time from digest_get_hash_size(algo3) and hex_buf_size is a function parameter, so the expression is not a compile-time constant or invariant.\n\n- if (MHD_NO == MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (algo3, username, realm, userhash_bin, MAX_DIGEST))\n  - the controlling expression depends on the return value of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash, which is a run-time function call and thus not invariant. Although MHD_NO is an enumeration/constant, the overall expression is not constant.\n\nThere are no loop constructs (while/for/do-while) with controlling expressions in this function, so the specified MISRA Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) has no applicable violations in the presented code fragment."
