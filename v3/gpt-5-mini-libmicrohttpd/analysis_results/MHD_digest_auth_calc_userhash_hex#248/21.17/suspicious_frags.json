  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they do not themselves perform string handling or buffer writes that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. Specifically, the function signature, the simple declarations (other than the userhash_bin buffer), the final return statement, and the literal uses of the MHD_YES/MHD_NO enum do not call <string.h> functions nor directly write into the provided pointer buffers. The included fragments are the points where a computed digest size, buffer sizes, and calls that produce or format bytes into buffers interact \u2014 these require investigation for potential insufficient buffer size, mismatch between digest size and MAX_DIGEST, and integer overflow in the size arithmetic that could lead to accesses beyond the bounds of the destination buffers."
