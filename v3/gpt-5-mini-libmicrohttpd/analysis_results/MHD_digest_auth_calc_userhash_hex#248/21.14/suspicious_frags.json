  "explanation": "I examined the provided function body and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any apparent direct comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp). All operations are: calling digest_get_hash_size, a buffer-size check, calling MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash, and converting binary to hex via MHD_bin_to_hex_z. None of these lines invoke memcmp in this fragment, so there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14.\n\nNote: The only external calls in this fragment are to MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash and MHD_bin_to_hex_z; those functions are not shown. If you want a full compliance judgment for the whole module, their implementations should be reviewed to ensure they do not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. However, within the supplied code fragment itself there are no memcmp usages to investigate."
