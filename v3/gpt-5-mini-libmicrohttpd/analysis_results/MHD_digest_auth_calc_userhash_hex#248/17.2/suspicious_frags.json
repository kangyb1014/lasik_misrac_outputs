  "explanation": "The remaining code in the function is limited to local variable declarations (userhash_bin, digest_size), simple arithmetic and a buffer-size check (digest_size * 2 + 1 > hex_buf_size), and return statements. These statements do not perform function calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion, and do not reference other functions that might call back into MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex. Therefore they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2 based on the provided fragment."
