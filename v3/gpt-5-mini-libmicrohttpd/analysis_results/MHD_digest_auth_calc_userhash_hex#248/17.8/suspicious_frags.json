  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is assigned to or altered in this function. The only pointer parameter whose target is modified is userhash_hex via the call MHD_bin_to_hex_z(userhash_bin, digest_size, userhash_hex) \u2014 this modifies the object pointed to, which is allowed by Rule 17.8; the pointer variable userhash_hex itself is not reassigned. The const pointer parameters (username, realm) are not modified and are passed as const to callees. The scalar parameters (algo3, hex_buf_size) are only read, not written. No other fragments in this function perform assignments to parameter variables or otherwise modify parameter identifiers, so there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
