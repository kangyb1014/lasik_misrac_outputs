  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: static storage-class, an enum return type, standard library function fprintf, pointer indexing (param_name[1]), the ternary (?:) operator, logical negation (! 0) and relational operator (==). There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({:}), __builtin_* intrinsics, vendor pragmas, extended integer types, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
