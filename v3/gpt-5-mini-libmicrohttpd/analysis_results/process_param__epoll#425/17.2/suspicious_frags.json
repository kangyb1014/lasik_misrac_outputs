  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls) in the provided function. Reasons:\n- The function body contains no call to process_param__epoll (direct self-call) or to any other project function that might obviously call it back (no indirect recursion pattern).\n- Only external library call is fprintf, which is a standard library I/O function and does not call user application functions in normal use. If fprintf were replaced by a project wrapper or macro that could call back into process_param__epoll, that wrapper would be outside this fragment and should be examined; however, there is no evidence of such a replacement in the shown code.\n- There are no function pointer dereferences, no callbacks invoked, and no function-like macros in the fragment that expand to function calls.\n- The remaining operations are simple condition checks, an assignment to a global struct member, and a ternary return expression \u2014 none of which introduce recursion.\n\nTherefore, based on the supplied code alone, there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.2. If reviewers want to be exhaustive, they should only check (outside this fragment) whether fprintf, PERF_RPL_PARAM_* identifiers, or any macros used here are defined as wrappers that could indirectly call process_param__epoll."
