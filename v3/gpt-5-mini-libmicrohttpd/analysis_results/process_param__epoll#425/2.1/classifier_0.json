  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Given only the fragment, there is no evidence that the 'if (tool_params.poll) { ... return; }' block is unreachable \u2014 its execution depends on the runtime value of tool_params.poll, so Rule 2.1 is not violated. (However, a violation would occur if tool_params.poll were known at compile-time to be a constant: e.g. if it is always false the 'if' body is unreachable; if it is always true the code after the return becomes unreachable.)"
