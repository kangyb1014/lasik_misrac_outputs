  "explanation": "I flagged all code locations that can affect reachability in this function: the two conditional blocks that perform an early return, the assignment that follows them, and the final return (the ternary) which is the function exit. Other fragments in the snippet (function signature, the fprintf format strings and string literals, braces, and the parameter name token) are not listed because they are not themselves unreachable-code concerns (they are reachable when their controlling conditions are satisfied or they are inert literals) and therefore do not need investigation specifically for MISRA C Rule 2.1. Note: potential issues unrelated to unreachable code (for example bounds/NULL checks for param_name[1] or the use of the constant expression '! 0') were not included because the task is limited to identifying code that could be unreachable."
