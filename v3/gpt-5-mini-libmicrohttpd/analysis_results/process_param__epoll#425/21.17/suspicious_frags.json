  "suspicious_frags": [

  "explanation": "The only operations in this function that can read memory via pointer parameters are the two fprintf calls that pass param_name with the \"%s\" format specifier and the direct indexed access param_name[1]. These can lead to out-of-bounds reads if param_name is NULL, not null-terminated, or shorter than 2 characters. Other fragments in the function (checks of tool_params.poll/select, assignment to tool_params.epoll, and the overall control flow/returns) do not perform pointer-based string accesses or call any <string.h> functions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
