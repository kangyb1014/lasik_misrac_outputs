  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The fragment does not call any <string.h> function, so Rule 21.17 is not violated. Note: the code does read param_name[1], which may be out-of-bounds if param_name points to a string shorter than 2 characters (e.g. \"\" or a single-character string) \u2014 that would be undefined behavior and could violate other MISRA rules, but it is not a violation of Rule 21.17."
