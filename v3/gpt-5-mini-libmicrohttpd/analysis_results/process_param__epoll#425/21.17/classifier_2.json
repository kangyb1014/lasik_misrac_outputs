  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code calls fprintf with \"%s\", which is not one of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (the rule targets functions like memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated. (Note: if param_name were NULL or not NUL-terminated this would be a runtime/UB issue, but that is outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
