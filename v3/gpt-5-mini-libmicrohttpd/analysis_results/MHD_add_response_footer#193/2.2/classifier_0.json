  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_footer:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *footer,\n                         const char *content)\n{\n  return add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment performs a call to add_response_entry and returns its result; removing this call/return would change program behaviour (it performs the footer addition and provides the function result), so it is not dead code."
