  "explanation": "No direct use of <string.h> string-handling functions appears elsewhere in this snippet. The function only forwards two const char * pointers (footer and content) to add_response_entry; any potential out-of-bounds string operations would occur inside add_response_entry, so the call site and the pointer parameters are the relevant fragments to investigate. Other lines (the extern/return type, the MHD_FOOTER_KIND token, and the simple wrapper nature of this function) do not themselves invoke string.h functions or perform memory accesses and therefore do not need investigation in the context of Rule 21.17."
