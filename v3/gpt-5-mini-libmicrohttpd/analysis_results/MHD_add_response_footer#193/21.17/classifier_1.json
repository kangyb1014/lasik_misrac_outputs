  "scenario": "The call itself does not use any <string.h> functions, so the fragment alone does not violate Rule 21.17. A violation could occur if add_response_entry internally uses string.h functions unsafely \u2014 for example, if add_response_entry copies footer into a fixed 64-byte destination using strcpy or memcpy(strlen(footer)+1) and footer points to a string longer than 63 characters, that would result in an out-of-bounds access."
