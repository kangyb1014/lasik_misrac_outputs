  "explanation": "No other code fragments in the provided snippet require investigation for Rule 17.2. The function shown does not call itself directly; it contains a single call to add_response_entry. There are no other functions, function pointers, macros, or indirect call sites present in the provided code that could introduce additional direct or indirect recursion. Any potential indirect recursion would depend on the implementation of add_response_entry (not provided), which is why the call to add_response_entry is reported for investigation. No other fragments need to be examined based on the supplied code."
