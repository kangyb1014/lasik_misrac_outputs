  "explanation": "The function consists solely of a single return statement that forwards to add_response_entry with three arguments. There are no conditional branches, labels, loops, or statements after the return that could be unreachable. The only identifiers that could affect behavior (MHD_EXTERN, MHD_FOOTER_KIND) are macros/enum constants used in declaration/arguments and do not introduce unreachable code in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for unreachable code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
