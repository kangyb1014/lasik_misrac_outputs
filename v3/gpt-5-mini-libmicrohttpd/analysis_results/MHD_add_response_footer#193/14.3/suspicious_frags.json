  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in this code fragment. The function contains only a return statement that forwards its parameters to add_response_entry; there are no loops, conditional statements (if/switch/?:), or other control constructs whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The declaration specifier macro (_MHD_EXTERN) and the function call itself are not controlling expressions. Any potential invariant controlling expressions within add_response_entry or other called code are outside the provided fragment and thus not to be investigated here."
