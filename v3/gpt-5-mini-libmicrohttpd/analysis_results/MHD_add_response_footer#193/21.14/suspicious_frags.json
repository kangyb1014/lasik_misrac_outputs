  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any raw memory comparison of strings are present in the provided code fragment. The function only forwards the footer and content pointers to add_response_entry and performs no string or memory comparisons itself. There are also no calls to other string-comparison APIs (strcmp, strncmp, etc.) in this snippet. If memcmp misuse is a concern, the implementation of add_response_entry (not provided here) would need to be inspected, but within the supplied code there are no fragments that violate or potentially violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
