  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they clearly perform modifications or require mutable access to the pointees, so const-qualification is not appropriate: - The reference count is decremented (\"--(response->reference_count)\") which modifies the pointed-to object. - Mutex operations (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_) take the address of response->mutex and operate on it (mutating state), so the mutex pointer and its pointee cannot be const-qualified. - The early NULL check and returns (\"if (NULL == response) return;\") are non-pointer-declaration control flows and irrelevant to const qualification. - The loop that updates response->first_header (assignment to that member) and frees nodes is already covered by the selected fragments that reference those members. The selected fragments contain the remaining pointer uses (local pointer declaration, accesses to header/value/data_iov/crfc and the final free) that should be reviewed to determine whether the pointees could/should be const-qualified or whether their types and ownership semantics preclude const."
