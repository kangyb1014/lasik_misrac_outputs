  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions (if / while) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The fragments listed are all controlling expressions in this function and thus should be inspected for possible invariance. Other parts of the function (calls to MHD_mutex_* and free, the body statements, pointer dereferences, the preprocessor #if/#endif blocks, and the function call response->crfc(response->crc_cls)) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3; they need not be investigated under this rule. No literal-constant infinite-loop constructs (e.g. for(;;) or while(1)) or do-while with an integer constant expression appear in this function."
