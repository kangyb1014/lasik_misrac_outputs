  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The function only performs pointer checks, reference_count decrement, mutex operations, a callback invocation (crfc), and calls to free(). Freeing memory and invoking callbacks or mutex helpers do not involve <string.h> string-handling calls and therefore cannot violate Rule 21.17 in this function. While pos->header and pos->value are freed, their allocation or any string operations on them (which could be relevant to Rule 21.17) do not occur here; such operations would need to be inspected in the code that writes to or copies into those buffers, not in this destructor. For these reasons, there are no code fragments in MHD_destroy_response that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
