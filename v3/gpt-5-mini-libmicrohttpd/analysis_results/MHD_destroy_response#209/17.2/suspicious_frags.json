  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns functions calling themselves directly or indirectly. Only function call sites can introduce such recursion. The listed fragments are all function calls present in this routine and therefore warrant inspection for potential direct or indirect calls back into MHD_destroy_response. Other parts of the function (NULL checks, the reference_count decrement, pointer assignments, loop control, and traversal of the header list) are simple operations that do not perform function calls and thus cannot by themselves create recursion; they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
