  "explanation": "I selected all code fragments that perform the function's cleanup (mutex unlock/destroy, callback invocation, freeing data_iov, freeing header list, final free). These fragments are the parts that can become unreachable at runtime depending on the early return taken after decrementing response->reference_count, and therefore should be investigated for possible unreachable-code issues or logic errors across build configurations. Other fragments in the function were not included because they are simple, directly reachable control or checks: the initial NULL check (if (NULL == response) return;) is an immediate, valid guard; the initial mutex lock (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&response->mutex);) and the reference-count decrement and test (if (0 != --(response->reference_count))) are the controlling operations that determine reachability of the cleanup code and are intentionally present; there is no other code in the function that is statically impossible to reach independent of runtime state or build-time macros. Therefore only the cleanup blocks listed above warrant further investigation for potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
