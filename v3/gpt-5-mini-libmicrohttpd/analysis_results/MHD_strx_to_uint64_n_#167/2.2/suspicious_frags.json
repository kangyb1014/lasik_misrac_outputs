  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are necessary for the intended behaviour and therefore do not appear to be dead code: the null-pointer check (if (! str || ! out_val) return 0;) prevents invalid use and is behaviourally significant; the loop control (while (i < maxlen && (digit = toxdigitvalue (str[i])) >= 0)) and the call to toxdigitvalue are required to parse characters and stop on non-hex input; the first part of the overflow test (res > (UINT64_MAX / 16)) and the overall overflow return are required to avoid wraparound; the res *= 16; and the index increment i++; are necessary to compute the numeric result and to advance through the input; the conditional assignment if (i) *out_val = res; prevents overwriting the output when no digits were parsed and thus changes observable behaviour if removed; and the function return of i conveys the number of characters processed. None of these other operations are redundant or removable without altering program behaviour, so they do not require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
