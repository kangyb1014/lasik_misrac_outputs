  "explanation": "No calls to any of the Standard Library string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The only access to the character buffer is via str[i], which is guarded by a null-pointer check (if (! str || ! out_val) return 0;) and the loop condition (i < maxlen), so the function itself does not call string.h routines nor obviously perform unbounded reads. The helper toxdigitvalue is called with a single character value (str[i]) and is not a string.h function; its implementation would be a separate concern but is not a string.h usage in this fragment. Note: if the caller provides a maxlen larger than the actual allocated size of the object referenced by str, this function could still read out-of-bounds \u2014 that is a caller-side contract/validation issue, not a use of <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation specifically for Rule 21.17."
