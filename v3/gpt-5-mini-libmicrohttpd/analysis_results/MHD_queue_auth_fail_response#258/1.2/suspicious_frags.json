  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions appear in the provided fragment. The code uses standard C constructs: an enum return type, function definition, struct pointer parameters, const qualifiers, and a simple return of a function call. Identifiers that start with an underscore (e.g. _MHD_EXTERN) and macros (e.g. MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) are present but their definitions/expansions are not in this snippet; the use of these identifiers alone is not an explicit compiler extension. If _MHD_EXTERN or other macros expand to compiler-specific extensions (for example __attribute__, __declspec, inline assembler, GCC statement expressions, nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions), those expansions would need to be inspected in their definitions \u2014 they are not visible here and therefore are not reported. In summary, nothing in the shown code text is an explicitly documented compiler language extension, so no fragments are flagged."
