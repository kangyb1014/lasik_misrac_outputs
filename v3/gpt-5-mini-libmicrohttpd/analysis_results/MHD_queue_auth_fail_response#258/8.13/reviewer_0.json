  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is speculative. The wrapper simply forwards the response pointer to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2; whether the parameter can be const depends on the callee\u2019s signature and whether either function (or other callers) actually modify the pointed-to MHD_Response. The snippet shown does not prove that the pointed-to object is never modified, nor does it show that the underlying MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 parameter is const-qualified. Without evidence that the response is not modified and that the callee accepts a const pointer, you cannot conclude a MISRA Rule 8.13 violation. If in the real code both this wrapper and the callee do not modify the response and the callee\u2019s prototype can be const-qualified, then both prototypes should be changed to use const to satisfy Rule 8.13; but based on the provided code alone, the report is not correct."
