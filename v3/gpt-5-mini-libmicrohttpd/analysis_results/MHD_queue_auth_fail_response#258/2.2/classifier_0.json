  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_queue_auth_fail_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              const char *realm,\n                              const char *opaque,\n                              struct MHD_Response *response,\n                              int signal_stale)\n{\n  return MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        opaque,\n                                        response,\n                                        signal_stale,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        opaque,\n                                        response,\n                                        signal_stale,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The return statement calls MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 and returns its result. This operation is executed when MHD_queue_auth_fail_response is invoked and removing it would change program behaviour (the wrapper would no longer call/return the result), so it is not dead code. (Only if the entire function is never referenced anywhere in the project would the function be dead, but that is outside the provided fragment.)"
