  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_queue_auth_fail_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              const char *realm,\n                              const char *opaque,\n                              struct MHD_Response *response,\n                              int signal_stale)\n{\n  return MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        opaque,\n                                        response,\n                                        signal_stale,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_queue_auth_fail_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              const char *realm,\n                              const char *opaque,\n                              struct MHD_Response *response,\n                              int signal_stale)\n{\n  return MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        opaque,\n                                        response,\n                                        signal_stale,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function is an active wrapper that forwards to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 with a default algorithm (MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5). Removing it would change program behaviour for any callers that invoke this API, so it is not dead code. (Hypothetical violation scenario: if this symbol were never referenced by the project and not required for external linkage, i.e. no internal calls and not part of the public API/ABI, then the function would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
