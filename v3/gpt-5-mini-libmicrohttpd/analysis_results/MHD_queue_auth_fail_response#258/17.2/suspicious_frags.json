  "explanation": "The provided function contains no direct self-call, so there is no evidence of direct recursion in this fragment. The only call is to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2; therefore the only potential violation of Rule 17.2 would be an indirect recursion if MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (directly or indirectly) calls back MHD_queue_auth_fail_response. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other constructs in this snippet that could hide a recursive call. Thus only the shown function (and specifically its call to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2) needs investigation \u2014 no other parts of this fragment require further review for Rule 17.2."
