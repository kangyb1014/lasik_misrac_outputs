  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this fragment. The parameters (connection, realm, opaque, response, signal_stale) are only used as arguments in a single return call; there are no assignments to the parameter identifiers, no increments/decrements, and no pointer reassignments. Passing a pointer parameter to another function does not itself modify the pointer parameter. The constant MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 is passed by value and not altered. Therefore there are no code locations in this fragment that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
