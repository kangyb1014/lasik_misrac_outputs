  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function. It is a simple wrapper that forwards its parameters to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 and returns its result. The fragment contains no calls to memcmp, no explicit string comparisons, and no operations on the null-terminated strings (realm, opaque) \u2014 they are only passed through. Therefore there are no occurrences in this code that could violate Rule 21.14. If memcmp is used, it would be in other functions (for example MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 or elsewhere), but those are outside the provided code and thus not subject to this review."
