  "explanation": "Other parts of the function only read parameter values or operate on local variables and standard library calls (memcmp, memchr, loop control, comparisons, returns). The listed fragments are the only places where objects related to function parameters are modified: they either assign to members of *pp or update the object pointed to by ioffptr, or create a local pointer derived from pp. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be allowed but the pointer parameter itself must not be altered; therefore the listed lines should be investigated to confirm the pointer variables (pp, ioffptr, boundary, etc.) themselves are not being modified and that only the pointed-to objects are changed. No assignment to the parameter variables pp, ioffptr (the pointer itself), boundary, blen, next_state or next_dash_state occurs elsewhere in the function, so other code fragments do not require investigation for this rule."
