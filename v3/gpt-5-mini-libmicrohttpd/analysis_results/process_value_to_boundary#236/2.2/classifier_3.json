  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_value_to_boundary:\n```c\nstatic int\nprocess_value_to_boundary (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                           size_t *ioffptr,\n                           const char *boundary,\n                           size_t blen,\n                           enum PP_State next_state,\n                           enum PP_State next_dash_state)\n{\n  char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  size_t newline;\n  const char *r;\n\n  /* all data in buf until the boundary\n     (\\r\\n--+boundary) is part of the value */\n  newline = 0;\n  while (1)\n  {\n    while (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos)\n    {\n      r = memchr (&buf[newline],\n                  '\\r',\n                  pp->buffer_pos - newline - 4);\n      if (NULL == r)\n      {\n        newline = pp->buffer_pos - 4;\n        break;\n      }\n      newline = (size_t) (r - buf);\n      if (0 == memcmp (\"\\r\\n--\",\n                       &buf[newline],\n                       4))\n        break;\n      newline++;\n    }\n    if (newline + blen + 4 <= pp->buffer_pos)\n    {\n      /* can check boundary */\n      if (0 != memcmp (&buf[newline + 4],\n                       boundary,\n                       blen))\n      {\n        /* no boundary, \"\\r\\n--\" is part of content, skip */\n        newline += 4;\n        continue;\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        /* boundary found, process until newline then\n           skip boundary and go back to init */\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash;\n        pp->state = next_state;\n        pp->dash_state = next_dash_state;\n        (*ioffptr) += blen + 4;             /* skip boundary as well */\n        buf[newline] = '\\0';\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      /* cannot check for boundary, process content that\n         we have and check again later; except, if we have\n         no content, abort (out of memory) */\n      if ( (0 == newline) &&\n           (pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size) )\n      {\n        pp->state = PP_Error;\n        return MHD_NO;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  /* newline is either at beginning of boundary or\n     at least at the last character that we are sure\n     is not part of the boundary */\n  if ( ( (pp->must_ikvi) ||\n         (0 != newline) ) &&\n       (MHD_NO == pp->ikvi (pp->cls,\n                            MHD_POSTDATA_KIND,\n                            pp->content_name,\n                            pp->content_filename,\n                            pp->content_type,\n                            pp->content_transfer_encoding,\n                            buf,\n                            pp->value_offset,\n                            newline)) )\n  {\n    pp->state = PP_Error;\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  pp->must_ikvi = false;\n  pp->value_offset += newline;\n  (*ioffptr) += newline;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( ( (pp->must_ikvi) ||\n         (0 != newline) ) &&\n       (MHD_NO == pp->ikvi (pp->cls,\n                            MHD_POSTDATA_KIND,\n                            pp->content_name,\n                            pp->content_filename,\n                            pp->content_type,\n                            pp->content_transfer_encoding,\n                            buf,\n                            pp->value_offset,\n                            newline)) )\n  {\n    pp->state = PP_Error;\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The conditional block is reachable (it executes when pp->must_ikvi is true or newline != 0) and contains a call via the function pointer pp->ikvi whose return value and side-effects affect program behaviour (on MHD_NO it sets pp->state and returns MHD_NO). Removing this code would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
