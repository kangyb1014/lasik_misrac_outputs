  "explanation": "I identified the above code fragments as potentially dead-code suspects to be investigated further. Other statements and expressions in the function are not listed because they are required for control flow, buffer searching, boundary detection, or produce observable side effects and therefore are unlikely to be dead code: the loop headers and conditions implement the scanning algorithm; the memchr/memcmp calls perform necessary searches and comparisons; assignments that update 'newline' and use it to control subsequent processing are essential to the algorithm; the error-path returns and pp->state assignments affect program control and error reporting; the calls into pp->ikvi and use of its return value are externally visible side effects (callback invocation). In short, everything not listed above is part of the core search/decision logic or causes observable effects and so is not considered a dead-code candidate for Rule 2.2 without further context."
