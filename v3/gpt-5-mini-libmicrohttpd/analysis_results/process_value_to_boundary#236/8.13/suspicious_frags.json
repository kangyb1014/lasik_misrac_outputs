  "explanation": "I selected fragments that involve pointers to buffer data (buf) being treated as non-const: the declaration and uses of buf (including passing slices to memchr/memcmp and passing buf to pp->ikvi) and the explicit write buf[newline] = '\\0'. These are the locations that should be investigated for compliance with Rule 8.13 (whether the pointers could/should be const-qualified). Other code fragments were not selected because they either already use const-qualified pointers (e.g. the parameter 'const char *boundary', the local 'const char *r'), or they modify the post-processor state or the ioffptr (so those pointer parameters cannot be const), or they perform logic that clearly requires writable access to buf (e.g. the assignment buf[newline] = '\\0' demonstrates writable use). Therefore other lines do not present obvious candidates for making pointer types const under Rule 8.13."
