  "explanation": "I selected the top-level infinite loop controlling expression while (1) because it is an invariant controlling expression and therefore must be checked against the MISRA 14.3 exceptions (invariants used to create infinite loops are permitted only when intentional). Other controlling expressions in the function do not need investigation under Rule 14.3 because they are not invariant: - while (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos): depends on newline and/or pp->buffer_pos, and newline is modified inside the loop (set to pp->buffer_pos - 4, updated from r - buf, or incremented), so the expression is not invariant. - if (NULL == r): r is assigned within the loop (memchr result), so the test is not invariant. - if (0 == memcmp(...)) and subsequent memcmp/memcmp checks: memcmp compares buffer contents and boundary; its result is data-dependent and not a compile-time invariant. - if (newline + blen + 4 <= pp->buffer_pos): depends on variables that can change before subsequent evaluations. - if ((0 == newline) && (pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size)): depends on runtime values which may change between calls; not a syntactic invariant. - the final compound if that calls pp->ikvi(...) depends on pp->must_ikvi, newline and the function call result, so it is not invariant. No do-while loops with constant false controlling expressions are present. Therefore the only fragment requiring investigation for Rule 14.3 is the explicit infinite loop while (1)."
