  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (conditions of if/while/for/switch/do-while). The remaining lines in the function are not controlling expressions (they are declarations, assignments, function calls, memory allocation, initializations, and return statements) and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 14.3. There are no loop constructs in the function that would implicate the rule's exceptions for infinite loops or do-while with constant false, so those exceptions do not apply to the non-selected code fragments."
