  "explanation": "This function itself does not call any <string.h> functions, so the only places relevant to Rule 21.17 are where an external buffer pointer and its size are accepted, validated, and stored for later use. The listed fragments cover: the function parameters (buffer and size), the runtime checks that try to guard invalid combinations (NULL buffer with non\u2011zero size, the MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN sentinel), and the assignments that record the pointer and size (and the free callback/closure which affect ownership and lifetime). Other code fragments in this function (memory allocation of the response object, mutex initialization, setting fd/reference_count, the free on allocation failure, and the final return) do not perform any string.h operations nor modify the buffer/size relationship used by potential string functions, so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses in this context."
