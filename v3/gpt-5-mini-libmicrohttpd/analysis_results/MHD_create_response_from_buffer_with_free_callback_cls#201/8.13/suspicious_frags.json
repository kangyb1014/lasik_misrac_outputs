  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointers to object data or already use const qualification. Examples: the parameter \"const void *buffer\" is already const-qualified; assignments of scalar members (fd, reference_count, total_size, data_size) are integer/size_t operations; NULL checks, memory allocation, and mutex initialization do not pertain to pointer const-qualification. The function-pointer parameter/type (MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc) and its assignment to r->crfc involve function pointers, which are outside the object-pointer const-qualification concern of this rule. Note: the struct definition is not provided, so only the explicit pointer-related fragments present in this function were flagged for potential loss or missing const qualification."
