  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size_t size,\n                                                        const void *buffer,\n                                                        MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback\n                                                        crfc,\n                                                        void *crfc_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n\n  if ((NULL == buffer) && (size > 0))\n    return NULL;\n#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T >= SIZEOF_UINT64_T\n  if (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN == size)\n    return NULL;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_SIZE_T >= SIZEOF_UINT64_T */\n  r = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL == r)\n    return NULL;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: these statements initialize the newly allocated struct r before it is returned. Removing them would change program behaviour because callers expect fields like fd, reference_count, total_size, data, data_size, crfc and crc_cls to be set. They are therefore not dead code. (A violation would occur only if none of these fields are ever read or are immediately overwritten before any use \u2014 in that case the assignments would be dead.)"
