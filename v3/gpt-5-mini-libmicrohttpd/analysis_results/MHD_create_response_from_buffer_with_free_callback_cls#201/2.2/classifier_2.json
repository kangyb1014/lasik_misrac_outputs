  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size_t size,\n                                                        const void *buffer,\n                                                        MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback\n                                                        crfc,\n                                                        void *crfc_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n\n  if ((NULL == buffer) && (size > 0))\n    return NULL;\n#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T >= SIZEOF_UINT64_T\n  if (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN == size)\n    return NULL;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_SIZE_T >= SIZEOF_UINT64_T */\n  r = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL == r)\n    return NULL;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "scenario": "The conditional check \"if ((NULL == buffer) && (size > 0)) return NULL;\" is an active runtime check that prevents constructing a response when a non\u2011zero size is paired with a NULL buffer. Removing it would change observable program behaviour (the function would accept NULL buffer with size>0 and proceed), so this is not dead code."
