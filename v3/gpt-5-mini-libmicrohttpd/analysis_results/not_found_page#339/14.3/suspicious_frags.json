  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The function contains only two conditional statements: 1) if (NULL == response) \u2014 response is assigned from MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and therefore not invariant; 2) if (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(...)) \u2014 the condition depends on the runtime return value of MHD_add_response_header and is not invariant. There are no loops (while, for, or do-while) with constant/invariant controlling expressions, and the (void) casts for cls and session are not control statements. Consequently, no code fragments in this function violate Rule 14.3 or match the listed exceptions (infinite loops or the permitted do-while case)."
