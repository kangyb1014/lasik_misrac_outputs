  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. There are no assignments to any parameter variables (cls, mime, session, connection) and no use of increment/decrement or reassignments on them. The (void) cls and (void) session casts merely suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not modify the parameters. Parameters are only read or passed to other functions (e.g. connection passed to MHD_queue_response, mime passed to MHD_add_response_header); modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter inside a called function is permitted by the rule and is outside the scope of this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
