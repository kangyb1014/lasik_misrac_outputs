  "explanation": "All other statements perform visible actions or are conditionally executed and therefore are not obvious candidates for dead code: the response creation call (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static) and its NULL check affect control flow; the call to MHD_queue_response assigns ret which is returned; MHD_add_response_header and the fprintf are conditional (their removal would change runtime behaviour on error paths); MHD_destroy_response releases resources and affects program behaviour. The casts inside the function call arguments are type operations required for the call and are not standalone executed statements. Therefore those fragments need not be investigated for dead-code under Rule 2.2."
