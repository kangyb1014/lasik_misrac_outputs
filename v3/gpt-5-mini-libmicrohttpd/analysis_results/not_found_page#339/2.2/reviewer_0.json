  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The two lines \u201c(void) cls;\u201d and \u201c(void) session;\u201d are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets dead code that is present but serves no purpose and could be removed without affecting program behaviour. In practice the void-cast is a deliberate annotation, not program logic; it exists solely to express intent and to affect compilation diagnostics rather than runtime behaviour. MISRA guidance accepts explicit use of such idioms (or other documented techniques, e.g. omitting the parameter name or using a project's UNUSED macro) to handle unused parameters. Therefore reporting these casts as a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
