  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is not conclusively correct. It is true that the asserted condition (digit < 10) is provably true given the algorithm and the domain of uint64_t (the way divisor and val are manipulated guarantees digit is in 0..9). Therefore the predicate itself is redundant in the logical sense. However, MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether removing the mhd_assert call would change behaviour depends on what mhd_assert expands to and on the system context:\n\n- If mhd_assert expands to a purely evaluative expression with no observable side effects (no logging, no diagnostics, no abort, no volatile access, and its execution time is irrelevant to the application), then the runtime check is an operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour and could be considered dead code in that concrete configuration. In that narrow case Agent A\u2019s reasoning would be correct.\n\n- In practice mhd_assert macros commonly produce diagnostics, logging, bookkeeping, or may abort on failure (or be compiled out in production). Such side effects mean the call is not dead code. Even if it has no side effects, removing it can change timing/ordering, and MISRA Note 1 explicitly warns that timing can be part of the observable behaviour of embedded systems; a timing change could therefore be a change in behaviour and the assertion would not be dead code.\n\nBecause the report assumes mhd_assert \"expands to an actual runtime check\" with no side effects and that timing is irrelevant, but the rule\u2019s applicability depends on the concrete expansion and system-level timing constraints, the claim as stated is not generally correct. To prove a violation you must show (and document) that in the specific project build: (1) mhd_assert executes in production, (2) its evaluation has no observable side effects and does not affect timing constraints relevant to system behaviour, and (3) its removal would therefore not change the system behaviour. Without that project-specific evidence, the report is not justified."
