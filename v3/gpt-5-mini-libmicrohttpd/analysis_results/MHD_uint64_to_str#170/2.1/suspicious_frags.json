  "explanation": "The fragments listed above should be reviewed for possible unreachable-code issues: the three assertions (mhd_assert lines) and the control-flow points that can prematurely return (the in-loop return and the final return) are the locations where unreachable code is most likely to arise and therefore warrant inspection. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 because they are plainly reachable or are simple initialisations/updates: divisor is initialized to a positive power of 10 and is reduced deterministically down to 1 by the loops (so the loops are not constant-false or otherwise statically infeasible), chr/buf assignments and increments are direct and executed when the loops run, arithmetic assignments (val %= divisor; divisor /= 10; digit = (int)(val/divisor);) are reachable from the loop body, and there are no other unconditional returns or dead branches outside the fragments already listed. The listed fragments therefore capture the control-flow points that could create unreachable code paths and should be investigated first."
