  "explanation": "The listed fragments contain controlling expressions that can become invariant depending on preprocessor configuration or compile-time constants, and thus should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other conditional and loop expressions in the function do not need investigation for this rule because they clearly depend on runtime-varying values or function results: - Conditions that test return values of function calls (e.g. sched_getaffinity checks) depend on runtime behavior. - Pointer-null checks (if (NULL != p_set)) depend on the result of CPU_ALLOC at runtime. - The if (0 == ret) after counting depends on the runtime outcome of the counting loop. - The CPU_ISSET test inside the loop depends on runtime data (cur_set). - The expressions that use loop variables (i < CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE) normally vary as i changes; they only become problematic if CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE is zero at compile time, which is why the for line itself was included in the suspicious list for explicit checking. These runtime-dependent expressions therefore do not represent obvious invariant controlling expressions and were not included in the suspicious list."
