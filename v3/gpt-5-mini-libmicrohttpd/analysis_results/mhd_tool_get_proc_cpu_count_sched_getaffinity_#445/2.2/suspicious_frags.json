  "explanation": "I flagged: the initial assignment \"int ret = -1;\" together with the immediately following \"if (0 >= ret) { ... }\" are suspicious because the condition is always true at function entry, so the conditional test (and possibly the initial assignment) may be redundant / constitute dead code and should be investigated. The second occurrence of \"if (0 >= ret)\" (inside the HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S block) is also flagged because its necessity depends on prior branches \u2014 it may be redundant in some configurations and should be checked. The final \"if (0 >= ret) return -1;\" is included because it gates the return value and could be related to redundant initialisation/conditions.\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA 2.2: conditional-compilation blocks (#if/#ifdef/#else/#endif) are configuration-dependent \u2014 code excluded by preprocessing is not part of the translation unit and thus not dead code in that build; the counting loop (for/CPU_ISSET) actively computes a value used later and the CPU_ALLOC/CPU_FREE pairs manage allocated memory and are used (or freed) depending on runtime checks. The sched_getaffinity calls and the distinct uses of CPU_COUNT/CPU_COUNT_S are functional operations whose removal would change behaviour when they succeed, so they are not candidates for dead code without further evidence."
