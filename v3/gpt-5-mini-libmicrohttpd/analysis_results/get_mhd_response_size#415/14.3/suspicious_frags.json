  "explanation": "Only the conditional controlling expressions in this function can violate MISRA C Rule 14.3. Those are the four if / else-if conditions listed above and have been reported for investigation because their invariance depends on the definition and initialization of tool_params (which is not shown). Other parts of the function do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: the final return statement is not a controlling expression, the function signature and return type are not relevant to this rule, and there are no loops or other controlling constructs in this function that could be invariant."
