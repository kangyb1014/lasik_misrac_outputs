  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function return type is 'const char *' and all returned values are string literals (which should be treated as const). There are no pointer parameters, no non-const pointer local variables, and no casts that would remove const qualification. Therefore Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible) is not applicable or violated in this snippet."
