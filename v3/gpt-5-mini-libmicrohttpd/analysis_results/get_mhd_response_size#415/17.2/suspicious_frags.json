  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no recursion). The function get_mhd_response_size contains only tests of data members (tool_params.empty / tiny / medium / large) and returns string literals; it makes no direct function calls, invokes no function pointers, and contains no function-like macro invocations in the shown code. Therefore there is no direct or indirect call to itself (or to any other function) to inspect for recursion. If tool_params.x were implemented as macros that expand to function calls (not evident from the provided snippet), those expansions would need review, but based on the presented code there is no recursion to investigate."
