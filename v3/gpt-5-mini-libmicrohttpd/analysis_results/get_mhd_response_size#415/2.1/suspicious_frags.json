  "explanation": "Only the conditional chain that selects the response string and the final fallback return need investigation for possible unreachable-code issues. The other parts of the function (the static qualifier, return type, function header, braces and individual return statements shown above) are normal, syntactically reachable constructs: each conditional branch contains an immediate return so those branches are reachable whenever the corresponding tool_params flag is true. There is no code after the final return that could be dead by construction, and no hidden statements or labels present in this snippet. Therefore no other fragments require investigation for Rule 2.1."
