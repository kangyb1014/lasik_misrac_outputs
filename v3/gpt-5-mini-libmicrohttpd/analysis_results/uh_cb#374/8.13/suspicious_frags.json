  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameters and assignments that involve pointer types which appear not to be modified in this function (or which store pointers to data that may be immutable) and thus could require investigation for possible const-qualification. I did not flag other fragments because: (1) extra_in is already const-qualified (const char *extra_in) and therefore complies with Rule 8.13; (2) the local pointer md is written to (its fields are initialized and modified), so md itself and fields that are modified must not be const; (3) the use of pthread_create requires the start routine and its argument as void * by the API, so that call cannot be changed to use a const-qualified pointer without changing the thread API; (4) calls to malloc and memset produce/consume writable memory as used here, so those allocations and writes are appropriate; and (5) other uses of non-pointer scalar types (size_t, MHD_socket) are not relevant to Rule 8.13. Investigate the listed fragments to determine whether parameters or stored pointers (for example connection, cls, req_cls, urh, and md->extra_in) could and should be declared to point to const-qualified types."
