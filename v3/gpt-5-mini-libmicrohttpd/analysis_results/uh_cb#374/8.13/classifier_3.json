  "scenario": "The code assigns malloc() to md->extra_in and then copies data into it with memcpy(md->extra_in, extra_in, extra_in_size). Therefore md->extra_in must be a non-const pointer (char *), because it is the destination of a write. Rule 8.13 (prefer const-qualified pointees when possible) does not apply here because the object is written to; making it const would be incorrect. If md->extra_in were declared as const char *, then the subsequent memcpy would be writing through a pointer to const which would be improper. As written, there is no violation of Rule 8.13."
