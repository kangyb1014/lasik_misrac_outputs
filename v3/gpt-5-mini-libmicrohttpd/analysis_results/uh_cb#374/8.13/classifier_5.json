  "scenario": "The function parameters cls, connection and req_cls are non-const pointers but are not modified (they are only cast to void to silence unused warnings), so they could and should be declared as const (e.g. const void *cls, const struct MHD_Connection *connection, const void *req_cls). extra_in is already const. Depending on the use of urh (it is stored into md->urh here), urh could also be const if neither this function nor the worker thread modify the pointed-to object; if the worker needs to modify it then urh must remain non-const. Given the fragment as shown, the non-const declarations of cls, connection and req_cls violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
