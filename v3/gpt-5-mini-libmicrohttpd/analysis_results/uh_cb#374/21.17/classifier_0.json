  "scenario": "No violation: md is allocated with malloc(sizeof(struct MyData)) and the return is checked for NULL. The subsequent memset writes exactly sizeof(struct MyData) bytes into the allocated object, so it does not access beyond the bounds. (Note: this assumes sizeof(struct MyData) reflects the intended allocation \u2014 e.g. there is no unhandled flexible array member requiring a larger allocation.)"
