  "explanation": "Only the occurrence of the identifier _MHD_EXTERN is flagged because it is a macro that commonly expands to compiler-specific linkage/attribute keywords (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)), which are explicit compiler language extensions per compiler documentation. No other language extensions are present in the shown code: there are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __declspec, __builtin_..., typeof, __extension__, or C++-only constructs; the use of structs, enums, function pointers (iterator), NULL, standard control flow, and pointer dereferencing are all standard C and do not by themselves indicate compiler extensions. Identifiers beginning with underscores (e.g. type/identifier names) are a naming/reservation concern but are not compiler language extensions and therefore are not reported here."
