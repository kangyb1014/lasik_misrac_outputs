  "explanation": "I have listed all controlling expressions in the function that could potentially be invariant and therefore need inspection under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: the initial NULL check, the for-loop condition, the header-kind test, and the combined iterator invocation test. Other fragments do not contain controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: declarations (int ret; struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;), assignments and initializations (ret = 0; pos = connection->rq.headers_received; ret++;), simple return statements (return -1; return ret;), and the function signature. Also, the only function call used as a controlling expression is the iterator invocation, which is included above. No do-while or deliberate infinite-loop constructs (the rule's permitted exceptions) are present in this function."
