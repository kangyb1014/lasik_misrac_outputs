  "explanation": "No direct use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) appears in this function; therefore there are no in-function string-handling calls to inspect. The function performs only pointer checks, a linked-list traversal (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next), and forwards pos->header and pos->value to an external callback. The only places that could lead to out-of-bounds string accesses are where this function passes string pointers into the external iterator (the callback parameter) \u2014 those call sites are reported above for investigation. All other fragments (NULL check of connection, the loop control and pos->kind tests, incrementing ret, and return statements) do not perform any string operations and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated."
