  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are manifestly invariant. Each conditional in the function depends on runtime data or function return values, so they should not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: \n\n- if ((0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && (0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD))) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of the parameter method and the strcmp results.\n- if (&aptr != *req_cls) \u2014 depends on the runtime value pointed to by req_cls.\n- if (NULL != strstr(url, \"../\")) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of url and the result of strstr.\n- if (-1 != fd) and later if (-1 == fd) \u2014 depend on the runtime result of open and subsequent assignment to fd.\n- if ((0 != fstat(fd, &buf)) || (! S_ISREG(buf.st_mode))) \u2014 depends on the runtime result of fstat and buf.st_mode.\n- if (0 != close(fd)) abort(); \u2014 depends on the runtime return value of close.\n- if (NULL == response) \u2014 depends on the runtime return value of MHD_create_response_from_fd64.\n\nNone of these are constant/invariant at compile-time (they rely on parameters, file system state, or function returns). There are also no loops with constant controlling expressions (no for/while/do-while with literal constant conditions). Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3 in this function."
