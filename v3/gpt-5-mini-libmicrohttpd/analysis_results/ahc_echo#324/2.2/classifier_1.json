  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ahc_echo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nahc_echo (void *cls,\n          struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n          const char *url,\n          const char *method,\n          const char *version,\n          const char *upload_data,\n          size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  static int aptr;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  int fd;\n  struct stat buf;\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The expression statement '(void) cls;' is a no-op executed solely to suppress an \"unused parameter\" compiler warning. Its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. To comply, either remove the unused parameter, omit its name in the function prototype/definition, or use an approved MISRA-compliant pattern to indicate an intentionally unused parameter (e.g. a dedicated UNUSED_PARAM macro that expands appropriately)."
