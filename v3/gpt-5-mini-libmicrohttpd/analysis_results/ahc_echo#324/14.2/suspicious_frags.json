  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in the provided function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the form of for loops; because there are no for loops in this code fragment, there are no code fragments that need investigation for compliance with Rule 14.2. \n\nNotes supporting this conclusion:\n- The function contains only variable declarations, if/else conditionals, calls to library functions (open, fstat, close, MHD_* helpers), and return statements \u2014 no for keyword or loop construct is present.\n- Parentheses and compound conditions (e.g. if ((0 != strcmp(...)) && ...) ) are conditionals, not loops; they are not relevant to Rule 14.2.\n- Comments and string literals do not contain for-loop code to inspect.\n- Any looping that might occur inside called library functions (MHD_create_response_*, MHD_queue_response, etc.) is outside the source of this function and therefore out of scope for checking this function for Rule 14.2.\n\nGiven the absence of for loops in this function, no fragments need to be passed on for Rule 14.2 investigation."
