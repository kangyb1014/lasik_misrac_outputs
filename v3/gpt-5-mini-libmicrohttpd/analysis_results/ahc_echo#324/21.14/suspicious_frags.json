  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (neither direct calls nor obvious macro/alias usages). The code uses strcmp, strstr, strlen and other POSIX functions (open, fstat, close) but none of these are memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings). No indirect or function\u2011pointer references to memcmp are present in the shown code, so no further fragments require inspection for this rule."
