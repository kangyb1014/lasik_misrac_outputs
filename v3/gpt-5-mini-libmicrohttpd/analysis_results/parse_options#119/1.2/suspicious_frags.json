  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: 'static' storage-class specifier, an enum return type, pointer-to-struct parameters, and a variadic parameter list ('...') with the standard stdarg facility (va_list, va_start, va_end). There are no compiler-specific keywords, attributes (e.g. __attribute__), inline assembly, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other documented extensions. The identifier names (including trailing underscore) are ordinary identifiers, not extensions. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
