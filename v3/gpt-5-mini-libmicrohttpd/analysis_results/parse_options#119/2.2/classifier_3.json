  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_options:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nparse_options (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params,\n               ...)\n{\n  va_list ap;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  va_start (ap, params);\n  ret = parse_options_va (daemon,\n                          params,\n                          ap);\n  va_end (ap);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nva_end (ap);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call va_end(ap); is not dead code. It matches the earlier va_start(ap) and is required by the C standard and by some implementations to perform necessary cleanup (restore state, release resources, etc.). Removing it could change program behaviour on platforms where va_end is not a no-op, so the operation is not removable without affecting behaviour."
