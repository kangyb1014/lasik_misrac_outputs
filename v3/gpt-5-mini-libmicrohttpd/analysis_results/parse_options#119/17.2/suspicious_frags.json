  "explanation": "The only code fragment that could lead to direct or indirect recursion is the call to parse_options_va; it must be inspected to ensure parse_options_va does not (directly or indirectly) call parse_options. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the function header (definition) merely declares parse_options; the va_list declaration and the va_start/va_end macros manipulate argument state but do not introduce calls to parse_options; the variable declarations and the return statement do not perform any function calls that could cause recursion. Thus no other parts of this function present a recursion risk under Rule 17.2."
