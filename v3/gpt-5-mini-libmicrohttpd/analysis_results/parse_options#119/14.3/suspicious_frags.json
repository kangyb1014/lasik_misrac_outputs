  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the provided function body. Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions of loops and conditionals (for, while, do-while, if, switch). The parse_options function contains only variable\u2011argument setup (va_start/va_end), a single function call, and a return \u2014 none of these introduce a controlling expression to be checked against Rule 14.3. The va_start/va_end macros do not themselves create loop/conditional controlling expressions in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for invariant controlling expressions (the allowed exceptions such as intentional infinite loops or the do-while constant\u2011false case are not applicable here)."
