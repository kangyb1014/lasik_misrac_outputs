  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. The only pointer objects in this function are the two parameters of parse_options and their use when forwarded to parse_options_va; those are listed above for investigation. Other code in the fragment (the local va_list ap; the va_start/ap/va_end usage; the local enum MHD_Result ret; the return ret;) do not introduce pointer-to-object parameters that could/should be const-qualified, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated here. No other pointer declarations or pointer-casting operations are present in the provided code fragment."
