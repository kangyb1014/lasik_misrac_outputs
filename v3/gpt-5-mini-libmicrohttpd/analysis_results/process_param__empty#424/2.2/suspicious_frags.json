The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (function signature, braces, and surrounding structure) are ordinary control-flow and I/O operations whose removal would change program behaviour and thus are not candidates for dead code: the if-blocks perform runtime checks and emit diagnostic output (fprintf) and return error codes \u2014 these are observable effects; the function return is how the caller learns the parsing result; the assignment to tool_params.empty modifies program state used elsewhere. Each of those not listed above is therefore relevant to program semantics and not considered dead code. The listed fragments should be investigated because they are either unusual (tool_params.empty = ! 0;), involve branches that might never be reached (the three mutually similar if-blocks and the ternary return that depends on param_name[1]) or perform observable side-effects that could be redundant in context; these need checking against the wider project to determine whether they are actually dead code per MISRA C Rule 2.2."
