  "scenario": "The single assignment tool_params.empty = !0; is not inherently dead. It writes the value 1 (since !0 evaluates to 1) into a global/state object, so it affects program state and is not dead if that state is read later. However, if the project never reads tool_params.empty after this assignment (i.e. there are no subsequent accesses that depend on its value), then the assignment is an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour and therefore would constitute dead code (violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2). From the provided fragment alone this cannot be determined, so no violation can be concluded without whole-program analysis."
