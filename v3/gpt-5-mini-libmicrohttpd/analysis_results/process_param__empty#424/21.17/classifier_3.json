  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragment calls fprintf with a %s conversion, which is not one of the <string.h> functions listed by Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Therefore this specific rule is not violated. Note: if param_name were not a valid, nul-terminated pointer, fprintf could read out of bounds at runtime \u2014 that would be a different safety/UB issue but not a direct breach of Rule 21.17."
