  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (the subject of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14). There are no calls to memcmp in this code fragment. The only string/character operations present are: indexing param_name[1] and comparing that single character to '-' (a direct character comparison), and passing param_name to fprintf (which does not use memcmp). The assignment tool_params.empty = !0 and the conditional checks of tool_params flags likewise do not involve memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments here that match the Rule 21.14 concern (using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings) and nothing else in this snippet needs to be flagged for that rule."
