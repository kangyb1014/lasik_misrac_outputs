  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Explanation by fragment type:\n\n- if (tool_params.tiny), if (tool_params.medium), if (tool_params.large): these are ordinary if-statements whose controlling expressions depend on mutable global state (tool_params fields). They are not compile-time or function-scope invariants and therefore do not violate Rule 14.3.\n\n- tool_params.empty = ! 0; : this is an assignment, not a controlling expression. It merely sets a flag to a non-zero value and is not relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\n- return '-' == param_name[1] ? PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR : PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR; : the conditional (?:) operator uses param_name[1], which depends on the caller-supplied argument and is not an invariant. It therefore does not violate Rule 14.3.\n\n- There are no while/for/do-while loops or switch controlling expressions in this function that could be invariant. Also none of the allowed exceptions (intentional infinite loop or permitted do-while integer constant expression) apply here.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
