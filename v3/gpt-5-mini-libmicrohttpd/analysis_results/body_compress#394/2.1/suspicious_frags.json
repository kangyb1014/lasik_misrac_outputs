  "explanation": "The remaining lines (variable declarations, cbuf_size = compressBound((uLong) *buf_size); cbuf = malloc(cbuf_size); if (NULL == cbuf) return MHD_NO; ret = compress(...); and the surrounding function body) are not suspected of containing unreachable code: each of those statements can be executed at runtime depending on inputs and dynamic allocation results. The malloc(NULL) check and the call to compress are normal runtime checks/operations and lead into the conditional block(s) already flagged. The only potential unreachable behaviour in this function is the possibility that the success path (the final free(*buf)/assignment/return MHD_YES) can never be taken because the if-condition (especially the cbuf_size >= *buf_size clause) may be tautologically true given compressBound(), so the failure branch would always be taken. Therefore only the conditional failure block and the subsequent success block need investigation for possible unreachable code; no other fragments in this function show signs of being unreachable."
