  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: cbuf has type Bytef * (modifiable), and *buf is a void * (modifiable pointer). Assigning cbuf to *buf does not discard const qualification. The buffer must be writable (compression wrote into cbuf), so a non-const target is appropriate. A violation would occur if a const-qualified object (e.g. const Bytef *) were cast to void * or assigned to a non-const target, which would discard const; that is not happening here."
