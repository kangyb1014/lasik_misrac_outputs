  "explanation": "Only the function-call sites need investigation for potential direct or indirect recursion. The function body contains no calls to body_compress itself, no function-pointer invocations, and no callbacks that could hide an indirect call. Variable declarations, casts, assignments and return statements do not affect Rule 17.2 and therefore do not require investigation. Investigate the listed external calls to ensure none of those functions (or their implementations in this project) call back into body_compress either directly or via other functions."
