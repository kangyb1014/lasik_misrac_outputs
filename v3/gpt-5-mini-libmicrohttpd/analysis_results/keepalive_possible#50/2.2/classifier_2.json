  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The line is an assertion (mhd_assert) that evaluates a pure condition; it is a diagnostic/runtime check, not an operation whose removal would never affect behaviour. If the assertion is compiled in and fails it can alter program behaviour (e.g. abort), so removing it would change behaviour; thus it is not dead code. If the macro is compiled out to nothing in some builds, then the code is not executed (and therefore also not \"dead code\" as defined by the rule, which concerns executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour). A true Rule 2.2 violation would occur only if mhd_assert expanded to an executed no-op with no observable effect (i.e. executed but removable without changing behaviour)."
