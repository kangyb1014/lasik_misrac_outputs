  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in this function. Specifically, the code does not use any of the common compiler extensions that would trigger Rule 1.2 investigations, such as:\n- GCC/Clang extensions like __attribute__, __asm__, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, labels as values, or token-pasting/variadic macro extensions.\n- Microsoft-specific keywords or extensions (e.g. __cdecl, __stdcall, __declspec).\n- Inline assembler or other non-standard language constructs.\n\nNotes on potentially questionable items that do NOT require investigation for MISRA Rule 1.2 (language/compiler extensions):\n- tsearch (and related search.h functions) and types like socklen_t/struct sockaddr_storage are POSIX API/library features, not compiler language extensions; Rule 1.2 targets compiler language extensions, so library/OS API usage is outside this specific check (though they may be relevant to other MISRA or portability checks).\n- The explicit cast of malloc, use of enums, pointers, static function scope, and standard control flow are all standard C constructs, not compiler extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of compiler language extensions). If you want, I can additionally flag POSIX or platform-specific API usage for a separate portability check."
