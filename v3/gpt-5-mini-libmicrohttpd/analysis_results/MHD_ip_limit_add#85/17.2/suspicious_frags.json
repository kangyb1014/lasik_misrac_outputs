  "explanation": "The fragments reported above are the only places in this function that invoke other functions (or pass a function pointer) that could potentially lead to indirect recursion and therefore require investigation against MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Other code in this function consists of local variable declarations, simple assignments, comparisons, the increment ++keyp->count, memory allocation/free (malloc/free), conditional returns, and comments. Those operations do not call user-defined functions (or only call standard library malloc/free which do not invoke user callbacks in C) and thus cannot directly or indirectly result in MHD_ip_limit_add calling itself. Therefore they do not need to be investigated for recursive calls under Rule 17.2."
