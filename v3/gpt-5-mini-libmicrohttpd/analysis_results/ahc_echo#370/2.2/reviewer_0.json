  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements (void) cls; (and the similar casts for url, version, upload_data, upload_data_size) are expression-statements that evaluate a value and have no side effects. By the plain wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, \"Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.\" Removing these no-op cast-statements would not change the program's observable behaviour, so they meet the rule's definition of dead code and therefore constitute a Rule 2.2 violation. (Note: while this is a common idiom to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters, that suppression of diagnostics is not part of the program's runtime behaviour as defined by the rule.)"
