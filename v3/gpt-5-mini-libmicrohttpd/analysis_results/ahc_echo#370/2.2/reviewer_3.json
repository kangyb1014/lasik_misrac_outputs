  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) version;' is an evaluated expression statement that performs no observable side effect (it merely reads a parameter and discards the value). Its removal would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The code is reachable (so Note 2 does not exempt it), and initialization exceptions do not apply. Therefore the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is valid."
