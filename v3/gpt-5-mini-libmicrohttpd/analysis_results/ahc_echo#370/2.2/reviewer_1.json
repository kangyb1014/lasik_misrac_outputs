  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines like (void) upload_data_size; are the common idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused (silencing compiler warnings) and are not the kind of unintended \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 that Rule 2.2 targets. Although the cast-to-void expression performs no runtime action and its literal removal would not change program behaviour, it is a documented, deliberate use of the identifier to express intent (and in some builds/contexts the parameter might be used). MISRA\u2019s prohibition on dead code is aimed at unintended no\u2011ops that serve no purpose; this idiom is an accepted way to show an unused parameter and is not a Rule 2.2 violation in this context. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim is incorrect."
