It has no side effects and removing it would not change program behaviour, therefore it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Each line like \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d is an expression-statement that evaluates a non-volatile parameter and has no observable effect; removing those statements does not change the program\u2019s behaviour (except possibly minute timing differences in a particular embedded environment). By the literal wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), these executed no-op casts meet the definition of dead code. (They would not be dead code if the parameter were volatile or if the access had a required side effect, or if you can show the timing change changes observable behaviour.) If these lines are used only to silence compiler warnings, prefer other approved remedies (e.g. remove the unused parameter, use a standard UNUSED macro/attribute, or formally document/deviate) rather than leaving executed no-op statements."
