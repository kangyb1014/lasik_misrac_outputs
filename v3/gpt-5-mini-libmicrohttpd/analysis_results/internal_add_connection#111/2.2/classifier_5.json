  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of internal_add_connection:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ninternal_add_connection (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                         MHD_socket client_socket,\n                         const struct sockaddr_storage *addr,\n                         socklen_t addrlen,\n                         bool external_add,\n                         bool non_blck,\n                         bool sk_spipe_supprs,\n                         enum MHD_tristate sk_is_nonip)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *connection;\n\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  /* Direct add to master daemon could never happen. */\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif\n\n  if (MHD_D_IS_USING_SELECT_ (daemon) &&\n      (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a conditional logging call compiled only when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined. When executed it produces observable diagnostic output (and can affect timing), so removing it would change program behaviour; hence it is not dead code. If MHD_DLOG were defined as a no-op macro that expands to nothing, then there would be no executed operation and nothing to consider dead, but with the shown call the rule is not violated."
