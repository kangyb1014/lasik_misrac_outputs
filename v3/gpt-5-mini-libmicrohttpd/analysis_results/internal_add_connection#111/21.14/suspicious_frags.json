  "explanation": "I inspected the entire internal_add_connection function source provided and found no use of the standard library function memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp, nor to wrapper names that clearly map to memcmp (no occurrences of the token \u201cmemcmp\u201d). The code also does not perform string comparisons using pointer/array operations that would imply a hidden memcmp use. The other identifiers in the function are project-specific (e.g. MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_DLOG, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_itc_activate_) and none of them are the standard memcmp; without their definitions there is no evidence in this fragment that they expand to or call memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). If you want, I can also scan additional source files or macro definitions to ensure none of the project-specific wrappers call memcmp internally."
