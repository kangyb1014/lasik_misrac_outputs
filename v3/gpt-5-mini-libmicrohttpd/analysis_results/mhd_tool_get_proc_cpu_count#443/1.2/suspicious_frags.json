  "explanation": "The only elements in this function that may rely on compiler/implementation-provided language extensions are the use of predefined/implementation macros (__linux__, __GLIBC__) in the preprocessor conditional. Other parts of the code are standard C constructs (function definition, local variable, if tests, return statements, function calls, #endif) and do not use compiler language extensions. The calls to platform-specific APIs (sched_getaffinity, cpuset_getaffinity, *_np, w32 functions) are platform/library-specific symbols, not language/compiler extensions documented as such; they should be reviewed for portability or API conformance but are outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 1.2 (language extensions). The identifier naming (including trailing underscores in helper function names) are user-defined identifiers and not compiler extensions. Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 1.2."
