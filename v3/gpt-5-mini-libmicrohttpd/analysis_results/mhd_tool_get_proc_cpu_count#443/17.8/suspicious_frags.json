  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in the provided code: the function is declared as mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count(void). All modifications in the body are to the local variable 'res' and to control flow (returns). The calls to helper functions pass no arguments, so there is no parameter being modified here. Preprocessor branches only select which calls are made; they do not introduce or modify parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate or merit investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. (Note: the implementations of the called helper functions are not shown here; those functions should be reviewed separately if you need to check whether they modify their own parameters.)"
