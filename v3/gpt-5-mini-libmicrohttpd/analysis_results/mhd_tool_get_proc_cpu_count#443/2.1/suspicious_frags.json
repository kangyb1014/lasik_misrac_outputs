  "explanation": "I selected the conditional-compilation blocks and the subsequent platform-specific calls and final return because these are the code locations where statements can be compiled out or bypassed by early returns, and thus are the likely spots to investigate for unreachable code across different build configurations. Other fragments were not selected because they do not represent executable statements that could be statically unreachable in the resulting translation unit: the function signature and opening/closing braces, the local variable declaration (int res;), the preprocessor directives themselves (#if/#else/#endif as markers), and the in-source comments are either structural, compile-time selectors, or non-executable and therefore do not constitute unreachable code that needs investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
