  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are manifestly invariant. The only C controlling constructs are several if (0 < res) tests; in each case res is assigned immediately beforehand by a function call, so the controlling expression depends on the function result and is not a compile-time constant or invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) whose controlling expressions are constant, and no do-while with an essentially Boolean constant controlling expression. Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) are not C controlling expressions governed by MISRA C Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
