Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count:\n```c\nint\nmhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count (void)\n{\n  int res;\n\n#if defined(__linux__) || defined(__GLIBC__)\n  /* On Linux kernel try first 'sched_getaffinity()' as it should be\n     the native API.\n     Also try it first on other kernels if Glibc is used. */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n#else  /* ! __linux__ && ! __GLIBC__ */\n  /* On non-Linux kernels 'cpuset_getaffinity()' could be the native API,\n     while 'sched_getaffinity()' could be implemented in compatibility layer. */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n#endif /* ! __linux__ && ! __GLIBC__ */\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  return -1;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  /* On Linux kernel try first 'sched_getaffinity()' as it should be\n     the native API.\n     Also try it first on other kernels if Glibc is used. */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. Both calls are potentially executed at runtime depending on the return values: if mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_() returns a non\u2011positive value the second call is executed, so removing either call could change program behaviour (e.g. when the first API is unavailable or fails), therefore this is not dead code."
