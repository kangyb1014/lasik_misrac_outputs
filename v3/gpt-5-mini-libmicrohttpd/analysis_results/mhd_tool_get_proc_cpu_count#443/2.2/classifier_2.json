  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count:\n```c\nint\nmhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count (void)\n{\n  int res;\n\n#if defined(__linux__) || defined(__GLIBC__)\n  /* On Linux kernel try first 'sched_getaffinity()' as it should be\n     the native API.\n     Also try it first on other kernels if Glibc is used. */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n#else  /* ! __linux__ && ! __GLIBC__ */\n  /* On non-Linux kernels 'cpuset_getaffinity()' could be the native API,\n     while 'sched_getaffinity()' could be implemented in compatibility layer. */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n#endif /* ! __linux__ && ! __GLIBC__ */\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  return -1;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nres = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_ ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_(); is a fallback attempt (executed only if earlier affinity checks did not return a positive count) and can affect behaviour (it may return a positive CPU count and cause the function to return early). Therefore, on the information given it is not dead code. \n\nHypothetical violating scenario: if mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_() is guaranteed (by implementation or platform constraints) to always return <= 0 and has no observable side effects, then the call would be an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour and thus would violate Rule 2.2."
