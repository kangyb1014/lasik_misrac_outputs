  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are potentially relevant to unreachable-code concerns and warrant further investigation:\n- The initial request-creation branch returns early (return MHD_YES). This early return means the remainder of the function is not executed for the first call that creates the request object; verify this control flow is intended and does not hide unreachable statements elsewhere.\n- The POST-handling block contains multiple early returns and then reassigns method to a fake GET; this transforms control flow and may make other branches (or code following) effectively unreachable in some execution sequences \u2014 worth checking.\n- The pages lookup loop followed immediately by pages[i].handler(...) may call a handler when pages[i].url == NULL (if no match found) depending on pages sentinel layout; that could indicate either intended sentinel handling or an unreachable/invalid handler call.\n- The final \"unsupported HTTP method\" response block is only reachable if the method is neither GET, HEAD nor converted-from-POST; depending on how methods are provided by the environment (and the earlier forced conversion of POST to GET), this block might be unreachable \u2014 verify which HTTP methods can actually occur.\n\nFragments I did not mark as suspicious (and why):\n- Declarations and the two (void) casts for cls and version are harmless and not unreachable code; they exist to suppress unused-parameter warnings.\n- The fprintf calls used to report allocation/post-processor/session failures are reachable only on error paths and are part of normal control flow reporting, not unreachable code.\n- The session setup, time() assignment, and other single-line statements (e.g., request->pp = NULL, *upload_data_size = 0) are reachable through the control paths identified above and are not inherently unreachable.\n- The function-level returns (e.g., return ret at the end) and the nested returns inside error checks are part of explicit control flow; they are reachable depending on runtime conditions and therefore are not flagged here as unreachable code.\n\nPlease investigate the selected fragments to determine whether any code is truly unreachable in all possible executions (MISRA Rule 2.1) or whether the early returns and sentinel/handler usage are intended behavior."
