  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp. The only string comparison present is strcmp(method, \"GET\"), which does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (the rule forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). There are no other calls or macros that expand to memcmp in the snippet, so there are no code fragments that need investigation for this specific rule."
