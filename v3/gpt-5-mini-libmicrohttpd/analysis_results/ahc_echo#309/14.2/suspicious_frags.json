First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loops or loop constructs are present in the provided code fragment. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements (their three clauses, loop counter use, and side-effects). In this snippet there are: - No for statements. - No while or do-while loops that could be relevant to loop-counter usage. - No loop counters, loop control flags, or loop body modifications to inspect. The uses of (void) to suppress unused-parameter warnings and the call to strcmp are not related to Rule 14.2. Although the identifier \"response\" is referenced, its definition is not shown; that is a separate issue (not related to Rule 14.2) and therefore should not be investigated under this rule. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this snippet that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
