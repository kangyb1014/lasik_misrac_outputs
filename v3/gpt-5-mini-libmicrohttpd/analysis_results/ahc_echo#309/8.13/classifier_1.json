  "scenario": "Not violated in this context. The parameter \"struct MHD_Connection *connection\" is passed to MHD_queue_response which (by its prototype) takes a non-const pointer and may modify the connection state; therefore the pointer cannot be safely changed to point to a const-qualified type. A violation would occur if neither this function nor any callee modified the pointed-to object \u2014 e.g. if ahc_echo and all callees only read the connection \u2014 in which case it should be declared as \"const struct MHD_Connection *connection\"."
