  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters cls, url, version, upload_data, upload_data_size and req_cls are only cast to (void) to silence unused warnings \u2014 this does not alter their values. The parameter method is passed to strcmp (a const char * parameter) and is not assigned to or otherwise modified. The parameter connection is forwarded to MHD_queue_response but is not reassigned or modified in this function. There are no assignments to any parameter variables, no pointer reassignments, and no writes through pointer parameters in the shown code, so there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
