  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not warrant investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain no calls that could directly or indirectly re-enter ahc_echo: the (void) casts simply silence unused-parameter warnings and perform no calls; the strcmp check and the immediate return of MHD_NO are simple, non-calling control flow and do not invoke callbacks; there are no function-pointer dereferences or other library calls in this function besides strcmp and MHD_queue_response. Therefore only the function definition (to show the function under inspection) and the call to MHD_queue_response need investigation, since that external call is the only place in this code that could potentially trigger an indirect call back into ahc_echo via the surrounding framework."
