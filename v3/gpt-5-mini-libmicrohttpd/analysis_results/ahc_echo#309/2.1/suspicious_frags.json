  "explanation": "I selected the entire ahc_echo function because its static linkage makes the whole function a candidate for being unreachable code if it is not referenced anywhere in the translation unit or project; that is the primary concern under MISRA C Rule 2.1. No other separate fragments outside this function exist in the supplied snippet.\n\nWhy other parts need not be investigated separately: the two return statements are reachable at runtime depending on the value of method (so there is no obvious code after a return that is statically unreachable). The (void) casts are intentional idioms to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not themselves create unreachable code. There are no constructs such as code appearing after an unconditional return, infinite loops that make following code unreachable, or labels/gotos that render subsequent code unreachable within the provided snippet. Therefore the focus for MISRA 2.1 investigation should be whether the static function ahc_echo is ever called (i.e. whether the function itself is unreachable) rather than the individual lines inside it."
