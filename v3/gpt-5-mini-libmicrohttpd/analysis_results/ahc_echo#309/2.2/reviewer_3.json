  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. The lines such as '(void) version;' are the standard idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In this case the cast-to-void has no runtime effect and its only purpose is to affect compile-time diagnostics/documentation, not the program's observable behaviour (including timing) in normal execution. Removing the statement therefore does not change the program behaviour, but MISRA's concern is about dead code that affects or misleads about behaviour; using (void)param is an explicit annotation of intent and is an accepted practice to avoid spurious warnings. Therefore the claim that these statements constitute a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
