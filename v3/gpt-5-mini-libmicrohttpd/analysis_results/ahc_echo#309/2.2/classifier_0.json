The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ahc_echo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nahc_echo (void *cls,\n          struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n          const char *url,\n          const char *method,\n          const char *version,\n          const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The statement '(void) upload_data;' is an executed no\u2011op whose removal would not affect program behaviour (it merely evaluates/ignores the parameter to silence a compiler warning). Therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Only if the evaluation had observable side\u2011effects \u2014 e.g. the parameter were volatile or its evaluation triggered a trap \u2014 would it not be dead code.)"
