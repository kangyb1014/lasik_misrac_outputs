  "explanation": "The other fragments in the function are conventional control flow and calls that implement the daemon wait logic and are not candidates for dead-code consideration: the early return on shutdown/threads is required behaviour; the conditional compilation and runtime checks select the appropriate I/O backend (poll/epoll/select) and the calls to MHD_poll_all, MHD_epoll and MHD_select perform the core work; MHD_cleanup_connections is intentionally invoked where needed (and omitted where the selected backend already performs cleanup); the final return of res is necessary. Several pieces are controlled by compile-time macros and/or runtime flags and so may be absent in some builds (not dead). The listed fragments are the locations most likely to contain operations that are effectively no-ops or redundant across builds (asserts, normalization of millisec, always-true if(1) default branch, duplicate/conditional cleanup calls and the FD_SETSIZE logging block) and therefore should be investigated for potential dead-code violations under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
