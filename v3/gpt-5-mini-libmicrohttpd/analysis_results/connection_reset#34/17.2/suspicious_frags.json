  "explanation": "Only calls (direct function calls or callback invocations) can introduce direct or indirect recursion back to connection_reset. The fragments listed above are the only places in this function that invoke other functions or external callbacks and therefore might (directly or indirectly) call connection_reset. Other statements in the function are simple assignments, assertions, arithmetic, enum/state updates, and memset operations which do not invoke user-defined functions that could recurse to connection_reset; hence they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. In particular, local variable aliasing, setting pointers to NULL, clearing structures with memset, mhd_assert calls, and plain arithmetic/size calculations cannot by themselves create indirect recursion and were therefore not included."
