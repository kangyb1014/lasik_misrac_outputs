  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment c->rp.response = NULL; is reachable on both paths \u2014 if c->rp.response is non-NULL the call to MHD_destroy_response(...) returns and execution continues to the assignment; if it is NULL the if-body is skipped and execution still reaches the assignment. The only hypothetical violation would be if MHD_destroy_response were a non-returning function (e.g. calls exit/longjmp/abort); in that special case the subsequent assignment would be unreachable, which would violate Rule 2.1."
