  "explanation": "I selected fragments where external function calls or assertions could change control flow or object lifetime in a way that would make subsequent code unreachable or invalid (these fragments are listed above). Other code in the function does not present obvious unreachable-code patterns and therefore does not need investigation for Rule 2.1: - Declarations and simple aliasing at the top (e.g. struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; struct MHD_Daemon *const d = connection->daemon;) are ordinary and reachable. - The overall if (! reuse) / else structure is a normal conditional with both branches potentially reachable depending on the reuse parameter. - Straightforward assignments and state updates (keepalive, state, event_loop_info), memset calls that clear rq/rp, and simple buffer-offset updates are ordinary reachable operations. - The conditional call patterns (e.g. the if (NULL != c->rp.response) guard) are normal and do not themselves imply unreachable code. The fragments I flagged are the points where called routines or assert macros could abort, free, or otherwise alter the connection or program flow such that the following statements could be unreachable or unsafe; these require investigation to determine whether any code after them is truly unreachable."
