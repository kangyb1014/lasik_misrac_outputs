The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_reset:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_reset (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  bool reuse)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const d = connection->daemon;\n\n  if (! reuse)\n  {\n    /* Next function will destroy response, notify client,\n     * destroy memory pool, and set connection state to \"CLOSED\" */\n    MHD_connection_close_ (c,\n                           c->stop_with_error ?\n                           MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR :\n                           MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK);\n    c->read_buffer = NULL;\n    c->read_buffer_size = 0;\n    c->read_buffer_offset = 0;\n    c->write_buffer = NULL;\n    c->write_buffer_size = 0;\n    c->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n    c->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    /* Reset connection to process the next request */\n    size_t new_read_buf_size;\n    mhd_assert (! c->stop_with_error);\n    mhd_assert (! c->discard_request);\n\n    if ( (NULL != d->notify_completed) &&\n         (c->rq.client_aware) )\n      d->notify_completed (d->notify_completed_cls,\n                           c,\n                           &c->rq.client_context,\n                           MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK);\n    c->rq.client_aware = false;\n\n    if (NULL != c->rp.response)\n      MHD_destroy_response (c->rp.response);\n    c->rp.response = NULL;\n\n    c->keepalive = MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN;\n    c->state = MHD_CONNECTION_INIT;\n    c->event_loop_info =\n      (0 == c->read_buffer_offset) ?\n      MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ : MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_PROCESS;\n\n    memset (&c->rq, 0, sizeof(c->rq));\n\n    /* iov (if any) will be deallocated by MHD_pool_reset */\n    memset (&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp));\n\n    c->write_buffer = NULL;\n    c->write_buffer_size = 0;\n    c->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n    c->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n    c->continue_message_write_offset = 0;\n\n    /* Reset the read buffer to the starting size,\n       preserving the bytes we have already read. */\n    new_read_buf_size = c->daemon->pool_size / 2;\n    if (c->read_buffer_offset > new_read_buf_size)\n      new_read_buf_size = c->read_buffer_offset;\n\n    c->read_buffer\n      = MHD_pool_reset (c->pool,\n                        c->read_buffer,\n                        c->read_buffer_offset,\n                        new_read_buf_size);\n    c->read_buffer_size = new_read_buf_size;\n  }\n  c->rq.client_context = NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nc->write_buffer = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment c->write_buffer = NULL; occurs in the 'reuse' (else) path to clear the previous write buffer before processing the next request. Removing this assignment would leave c->write_buffer with its prior value on that execution path and could change program behaviour (dangling pointer or stale buffer usage). The same member is set to NULL in the non-reuse branch, but that does not render the else-branch assignment redundant because the two branches are distinct execution paths. Therefore this operation is not dead code."
