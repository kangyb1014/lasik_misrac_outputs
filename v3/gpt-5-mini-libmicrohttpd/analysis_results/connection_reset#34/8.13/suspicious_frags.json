  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that involve pointers which, from this function's code, appear to be used only for reading or passed to other components in a way that suggests they could be declared to point to const-qualified types. Specifically, 'd' is initialized and only read (no writes to *d in this function), so the pointed-to type might be const-qualified; the notify call passes fields from 'd' and an address of a client_context and thus should be reviewed to ensure the pointed-to types used in the callback have appropriate const qualification; MHD_destroy_response and MHD_pool_reset calls involve pointer arguments that might accept/return pointers that could be const-qualified depending on ownership/side-effects and thus should be checked. I did not mark other pointer usages because they clearly modify the pointee or the field storing the pointer in this function (so const-qualification of the pointed-to type would be inappropriate): for example, the connection pointer (connection / c) is used to modify many fields (read_buffer, write_buffer, rq, rp, keepalive, state, etc.), so the pointed-to type cannot be const; fields that are assigned NULL or values (c->read_buffer, c->write_buffer, c->rq.client_context, c->rp.response, etc.) are written to here; MHD_connection_close_ is called on 'c' which implies mutation/ownership effects; and the code explicitly resets structures and buffers \u2014 these are all legitimate reasons not to require const qualification of the pointee in those fragments. Therefore only the above fragments warrant further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 compliance."
