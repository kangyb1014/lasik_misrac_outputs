The function only reads members of *d (e.g. d->notify_completed, d->notify_completed_cls) and does not modify the daemon object, so the pointer should point to a const-qualified type. In other words it should be 'const struct MHD_Daemon *const d' (or at least 'const struct MHD_Daemon *d') to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In the function the local alias d is declared as\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const d = connection->daemon;\nwhich is a const pointer to a modifiable MHD_Daemon object. The code only reads members of *d (e.g. d->notify_completed, d->notify_completed_cls) and does not modify the daemon via d, so the pointed-to type can and should be const-qualified. The declaration should be changed to\n  const struct MHD_Daemon *const d = connection->daemon;\n(or at least const struct MHD_Daemon *d) unless there is a reason elsewhere in the function to require a non-const target (for example passing d to APIs that take a non-const pointer). Given the shown code, making the pointed-to type const is safe and satisfies MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
