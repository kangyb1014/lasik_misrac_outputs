  "explanation": "Other parts of the function are typical, reachable control flow and do not present obvious unreachable-code concerns: the initial NULL checks and early return are reachable; the while loop condition (digit = toxdigitvalue(str[i])) >= 0 is data-dependent and reachable for valid hex characters; the res multiplication and addition and the final if (i) *out_val = res; return i; are reachable when input contains hex digits. Therefore those fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1."
