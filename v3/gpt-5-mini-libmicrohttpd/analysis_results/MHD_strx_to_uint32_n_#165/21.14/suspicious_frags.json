  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function: there is no call to memcmp and no other standard string-comparison function from <string.h>. The code performs character-by-character processing via str[i] and a call to toxdigitvalue (which is not a standard library memcmp usage), and it explicitly bounds the loop with maxlen rather than relying on null-termination. Therefore no fragment in this function uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and nothing needs to be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
