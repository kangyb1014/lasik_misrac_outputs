  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the function is statically invariant, so Rule 14.3 does not appear to be breached. Specific controlling expressions and why they are not invariant:\n\n- if (! str || ! out_val)\n  - Depends on the pointer arguments at runtime; not a compile-time constant.\n\n- while (i < maxlen && (digit = toxdigitvalue (str[i])) >= 0)\n  - Depends on the loop index i, the maxlen parameter, and the runtime result of toxdigitvalue(str[i]) (the assignment yields a varying value). The presence of an assignment and function result makes the expression dynamic rather than invariant.\n\n- if ( (res > (UINT32_MAX / 16)) || ((res == (UINT32_MAX / 16)) && ((uint32_t) digit > (UINT32_MAX % 16)) ) )\n  - Depends on res (modified in the loop) and digit (set by toxdigitvalue each iteration); not constant.\n\n- if (i)\n  - Depends on the run-time value of i.\n\nNone of these are compile-time constant expressions or otherwise invariant at the point they are evaluated. The listed exceptions to Rule 14.3 (infinite loops via invariant expressions, or the specific do-while constant-false case) do not apply here. Therefore there are no code fragments needing investigation for Rule 14.3."
