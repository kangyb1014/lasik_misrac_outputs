True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'void *cls' is not const-qualified even though the function only reads from the pointed-to object (it casts cls to struct MHD_Response *response and only reads response->fd and response->fd_off). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared as const (e.g. const void *cls and const struct MHD_Response *response). The 'char *buf' is correctly non-const because the function writes into it.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is technically correct in the narrow sense that, inside this function, the cls object is only read (response->fd and response->fd_off) and therefore could be declared with a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *cls and const struct MHD_Response *response) to satisfy the spirit of Rule 8.13. However, in practice this function is a callback whose signature is imposed by an external API (the MHD content-reader callback type) and therefore the parameter type cannot be changed without breaking the required prototype. MISRA\u2019s guidance to \u201cconst-qualify whenever possible\u201d does not require changing a function\u2019s signature when that signature must match an external interface. Because the non-const void *cls is required by the external callback signature, the reported violation is not correct in this context. If this were an internal function with no external-signature constraint, then the report would be valid and the parameter should be made const-qualified."
