  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions that can be invariant (constant) across all runtime executions need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two reported if-statements combine a compile-time sizeof comparison with a runtime check; depending on platform (compile-time sizeof results) the overall controlling expression can become effectively invariant and therefore should be reviewed. Other conditionals and control expressions in the function (for example: if (offset64 < 0), if (max > SSIZE_MAX), if (0 == n), if (n < 0), if (INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE == fh), if (! ReadFile (...)), the various returns after read/pread/ReadFile, and the preprocessor #if / #else sections) depend on runtime values or are preprocessor directives and are not invariant controlling expressions in the sense of Rule 14.3, so they do not require investigation for this specific rule."
