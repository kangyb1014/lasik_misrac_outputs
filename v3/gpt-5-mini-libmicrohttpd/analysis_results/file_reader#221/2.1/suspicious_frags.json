  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation because they are ordinary runtime checks or controlled by preprocessor conditions in ways that do not, by themselves, imply unreachable code:\n\n- The majority of the code consists of runtime checks (offset64 < 0, read/pread return-value checks, clamping of max to SSIZE_MAX, lseek/pread64 calls and their error handling). These checks and returns are executed at runtime and can be reached depending on input and system call results, so they are not obviously unreachable.\n\n- The platform/feature-dependent alternatives (the #if/#elif/#else blocks for HAVE_PREAD64 / HAVE_PREAD / HAVE_LSEEK64 and the top-level _WIN32 / __CYGWIN__ condition) are valid conditional-compilation choices: only one alternative is present in any given build. Those alternatives are not intrinsically unreachable within a build configuration, so they were not flagged here (except for the Windows-specific block noted above because it represents a large platform-only block that should be checked for project-level unreachable code policies).\n\n- The only places that can produce dead/unreachable code regardless of runtime inputs are the two if-statements that test a compile-time sizeof(off_t) against sizeof(uint64_t). sizeof(off_t) is a translation-unit constant: if that comparison is false on the target platform the entire if-body (the return) is unreachable; if it is true the body may be reachable. Those two occurrences therefore warrant investigation.\n\n- The Windows-specific block (the #else ... #endif fragment shown) was included because, depending on project targets/configuration, that whole block may be excluded or included; project-level MISRA reachability concerns often require explicit review of such large platform-specific blocks to ensure they are not left unreachable/unused across the project.\n\nIf you want, I can also enumerate other conditional compilation fragments (each #if/#elif/#else region) so the reviewers can check each platform/configuration for unreachable code in the built project."
