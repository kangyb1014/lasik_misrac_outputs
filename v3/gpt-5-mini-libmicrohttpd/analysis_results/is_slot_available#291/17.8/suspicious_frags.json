  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The pointer parameter nn is declared const struct MHD_NonceNc *const nn: the pointed object and the pointer itself are const, so the function cannot legally modify nn or *nn. The code only reads nn->nonce and nn->nc.\n- The pointer parameter new_nonce is declared const char *const new_nonce: both the pointer and the pointed characters are const, and the code only reads it (memcmp), not assigning to it or performing pointer arithmetic.\n- The scalar parameter now is declared const uint64_t now and is only read; there is no assignment to now.\n- The scalar parameter new_nonce_len (size_t) is not modified anywhere (no assignment, increment/decrement, or address passed to a function that could modify it).\n- There are no assignments to any parameter identifiers, no increments/decrements, no pointer arithmetic on parameters, and no passing of parameter addresses to functions that would allow modification of the parameter variables themselves (the only address passed is &timestamp, a local variable).\n- Calls (memcmp, get_nonce_timestamp, mhd_assert) only read data and/or write to local variables; they do not change the parameter variables in this code.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to modify function parameters and thus no items requiring investigation for Rule 17.8."
