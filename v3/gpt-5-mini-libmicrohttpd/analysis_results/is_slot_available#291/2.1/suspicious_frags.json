  "explanation": "No unreachable-code fragments were identified. Each conditional return can be reached for some valid combination of inputs: the initial empty-slot check, identical-nonce check, nc nonzero check, malformed-last-byte check, invalid-timestamp check, and reuse-timeout check all represent distinct runtime outcomes. The assertions (mhd_assert) do not themselves introduce unreachable code because corresponding runtime checks immediately follow (e.g. checking the last nonce byte and timestamp_valid). The final return false is reachable when the slot is non-empty, contains a different properly formatted nonce, nc == 0, timestamp parsing succeeds, and the reuse timeout has not elapsed. Therefore there are no code fragments that are provably unreachable and no further investigation of unreachable-code violations is necessary."
