  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer declarations/parameters or already use const-qualified pointee types where appropriate. Specifically:\n- Integer variables (now, new_nonce_len, timestamp, timestamp_valid) and arithmetic/logic operations (comparisons, TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP, REUSE_TIMEOUT check, returns) do not introduce pointer-to-non-const issues.\n- The remaining mhd_assert calls that check scalar sizes/values do not involve pointer types requiring const qualification.\n- The code uses a pointer-to-const for the nonce parameter (new_nonce) and nn is declared as a pointer to a const struct; those declarations already address the rule where applicable.\nTherefore only the explicitly listed fragments (all places where nn->nonce and new_nonce are passed/used and the function signature) need further inspection to confirm that all pointer parameters and pointee types are const-qualified consistently (including the signature of get_nonce_timestamp and the actual type of the nonce member in struct MHD_NonceNc)."
