  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement is a contract-check assertion (mhd_assert). Assertions either expand to a runtime check that alters behavior on failure (so removal would change behavior in that fault case) or are compiled out and therefore not executed. MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour; this assertion does not meet that definition in normal use. (If, in a specific build, mhd_assert were implemented as an always\u2011evaluated no\u2011op with no side effects while still being executed and provably redundant, that specific implementation could create dead code, but nothing in the fragment itself proves that.)"
