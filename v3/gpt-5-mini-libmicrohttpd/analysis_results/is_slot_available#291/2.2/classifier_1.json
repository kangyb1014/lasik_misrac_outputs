The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_slot_available:\n```c\nstatic bool\nis_slot_available (const struct MHD_NonceNc *const nn,\n                   const uint64_t now,\n                   const char *const new_nonce,\n                   size_t new_nonce_len)\n{\n  uint64_t timestamp;\n  bool timestamp_valid;\n  mhd_assert (new_nonce_len <= NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST));\n  mhd_assert (NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST) <= MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH);\n  if (0 == nn->nonce[0])\n    return true; /* The slot is empty */\n\n  if (0 == memcmp (nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len))\n  {\n    /* The slot has the same nonce already.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to get_nonce_timestamp(...) sets 'timestamp' (used later in TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP(now - timestamp)) and produces 'timestamp_valid' which is tested by mhd_assert and by if (!timestamp_valid) return true;. Removing the call would therefore change program behaviour (use of an uninitialised/untested timestamp and different branching), so this operation is not dead code. (Only in the hypothetical case that get_nonce_timestamp had no side\u2011effects, always returned the same value and timestamp were already correct would the call be dead \u2014 but that is not the situation shown.)"
