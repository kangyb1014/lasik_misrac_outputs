Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The fragments selected are those that either are assertions (mhd_assert calls), duplicate checks paired with assertions, or operations whose result could be redundant or always the same depending on build configuration or external definitions (e.g. TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP / REUSE_TIMEOUT). These warrant investigation to determine whether they are effectively dead (executed but removable without changing behaviour) in some build configurations.\n\nWhy other fragments are NOT included: \n- The initial empty-slot check (if (0 == nn->nonce[0]) return true;) is essential control flow affecting behaviour and cannot be removed without changing semantics.\n- The nc reuse check (if (0 != nn->nc) return true;) directly affects reuse logic and is not a candidate for dead code.\n- The final return false; is the function's explicit result for the remaining valid case and is reachable by valid input combinations; it affects behaviour and is not dead.\n- Variable declarations and function signature are required and not removable without changing the function.\n- Comments have no effect on execution and are irrelevant to dead-code detection.\n\nInvestigate the listed fragments (assertions, duplicated checks, timestamp extraction, and timeout comparison) to determine whether any are effectively dead in some builds or configurations."
