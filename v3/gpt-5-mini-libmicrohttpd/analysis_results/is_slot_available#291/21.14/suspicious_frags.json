  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 targets uses of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The only memcmp call in this function is the fragment listed above and thus must be investigated. Other code in the function is not relevant to this rule: the mhd_assert checks only validate buffer sizes and invariants; the checks against 0 (e.g. nn->nonce[0], nn->nc, nn->nonce[sizeof(nn->nonce)-1]) are simple numeric/byte checks rather than string comparisons; get_nonce_timestamp and timestamp logic do not perform string comparisons with memcmp. No other memcmp or string-comparison calls are present in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation for Rule 21.14."
