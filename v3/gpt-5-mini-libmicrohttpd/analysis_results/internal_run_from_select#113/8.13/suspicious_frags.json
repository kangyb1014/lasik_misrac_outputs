  "explanation": "I included every place where fd_set pointers are either being cast away from const (uses of (fd_set *) _MHD_DROP_CONST(...)) or passed to a function that may expect non-const fd_set pointers (urh_from_fdset). These are the code fragments that need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either remove const qualification or potentially pass const data to APIs that may not be const-correct.\n\nOther fragments in the function were not included because they do not present const-qualification issues relevant to Rule 8.13: the daemon, connection (pos), and urh pointers are used to modify state (so they legitimately are non-const), calls like MHD_accept_connection, MHD_itc_clear_, MHD_resume_connection and MHD_cleanup_connections operate on modifiable structures and thus should not be const; uses of fd_setsize and integer values are not pointer const concerns. No other pointer usages in this function drop const or pass pointers that obviously could/should be const-qualified, so they need not be investigated for Rule 8.13."
