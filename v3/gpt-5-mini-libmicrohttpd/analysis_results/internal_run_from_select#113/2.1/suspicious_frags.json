  "explanation": "The fragments above are selected because they are guarded either by build-time macros or by predicates that may be statically true/false (or invariant at runtime for some builds), so those code regions can be (or appear to be) unreachable in some configurations and should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.1.\n\nWhy other code fragments need not be investigated here:\n- The initial mhd_assert(...) lines are assertions (likely compiled out in non-debug builds) and do not contain alternative control-flow that would create unreachable code paths; they are not execution branches to inspect for reachability.\n- The simple one-line statements such as (void) fd_setsize; (the first occurrence), daemon->data_already_pending = false;, new_connections_list_process_(daemon);, MHD_cleanup_connections(daemon); and return MHD_YES; are straightforward executable statements and are not unreachable by construction in the shown function body.\n- The simple acceptance call path (the if (need_to_accept) ... ) is already included as a suspicious fragment above (the larger if((MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != ds) && ... ) block was selected). Other single uses of FD_ISSET and direct variable reads/writes are normal runtime-conditioned code and are not intrinsically unreachable unless combined with configuration conditions (those combinations are included in the suspicious list).\n\nThe selected fragments cover: build-time conditional blocks (HTTPS/UPGRADE and FD_SETSIZE handling), the ITC-handling block, the listen/accept block, the no-thread-per-connection processing block (including its inner else for fd_set overflow), and the upgraded-HTTPS handling loop. These are the regions where reachability is most likely to be impacted by compile-time options or by invariants; they therefore warrant investigation for potential unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1."
