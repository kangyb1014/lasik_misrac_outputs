  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of internal_run_from_select:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ninternal_run_from_select (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                          const fd_set *read_fd_set,\n                          const fd_set *write_fd_set,\n                          const fd_set *except_fd_set,\n                          int fd_setsize)\n{\n  MHD_socket ds;\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT)\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urhn;\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT && UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n\n  mhd_assert ((0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY)) || \\\n              (MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_valid_ID_ (daemon->tid)));\n  mhd_assert ((0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY)) || \\\n              (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The for-loop header is: for (pos = daemon->connections_tail; NULL != pos; pos = pos->prev)\n\nAnalysis:\n- First clause: pos = daemon->connections_tail initializes the loop counter (pos). OK.\n- Second clause: NULL != pos uses only the loop counter and has no side effects. OK.\n- Third clause: pos = pos->prev modifies only the loop counter (pos). It reads pos->prev, which is derived from the loop counter. This is acceptable provided that no object used in that third clause (in particular, the prev link of the current node) is modified by the loop body or by any function called from the loop body.\n\nConclusion: is_rule_violated = false, when the loop body (and any called functions such as call_handlers) do not modify the list links or the prev member of the nodes being traversed. Violation scenario: if call_handlers (or any function invoked in the loop body) removes or alters the current node\u2019s prev pointer (for example deletes the node or relinks the list), then the third clause would be using an object modified by the loop body and Rule 14.2 would be violated."
