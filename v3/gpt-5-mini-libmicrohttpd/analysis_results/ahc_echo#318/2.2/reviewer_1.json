  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) upload_data_size; (and the other (void) parameter casts) are an intentional idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress spurious compiler diagnostics. MISRA\u2019s prohibition on dead code targets executed operations that can be removed without affecting the program\u2019s intended behaviour; these cast-to-void statements serve a clear purpose (documenting intent and suppressing diagnostics) and are the accepted way to indicate unused parameters. In practice MISRA guidance treats this idiom as acceptable, so this does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation."
