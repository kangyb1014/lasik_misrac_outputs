  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The five statements of the form \u201c(void) param;\u201d are expression statements that are reachable and executed (in the sense of being part of the function\u2019s flow) but have no side effects; their removal would not change the observable behaviour of the program. That matches the rule\u2019s definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour), so this contravenes MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: common idioms such as casting a parameter to void to suppress compiler warnings do not avoid the Rule 2.2 definition \u2014 if such constructs are required, they must be justified via a documented deviation or alternative approaches should be used (e.g. omit the parameter name in the function definition, use a compiler-specific attribute to mark a parameter unused, or otherwise restructure the code)."
