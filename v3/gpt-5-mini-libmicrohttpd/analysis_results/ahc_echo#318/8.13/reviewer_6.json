True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function parameter is void **req_cls and the code stores the address of the static int aptr into it: '*req_cls = &aptr;'. The pointer is only used for identity and the object is not modified through that pointer, so the pointed-to type could and should be const-qualified (e.g. const void *). Therefore this use violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct in this context. MISRA Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, but that proviso is subject to practical constraints such as required external interfaces. ahc_echo is a callback implementing the libmicrohttpd API which specifies the parameter as void **req_cls; the function must keep that exact prototype to be called by the library. Changing the declaration to, for example, const void **req_cls would be an incompatible change (and converting between T** and const T** is not a safe/implicit qualification conversion). Although the function only uses the pointer as an identity token and does not modify the int through the stored pointer, the API requirement prevents making the parameter point to a const-qualified type here. Therefore the reported violation is not correct for this code as written."
