  "scenario": "The code assigns NULL to *req_cls where req_cls is declared as void ** and is intentionally used to store and later reset a mutable per-request pointer (set to &aptr and then cleared). Because the pointee is purposely modified, it must not be const-qualified. Therefore this use does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (A violation would occur if the pointee were not modified and the parameter could be declared as pointer to const-qualified type, e.g. const void * const*.)"
