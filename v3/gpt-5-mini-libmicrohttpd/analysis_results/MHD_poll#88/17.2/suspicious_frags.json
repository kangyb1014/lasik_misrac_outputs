  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call to MHD_poll in this fragment, so the only possible violation of Rule 17.2 would be via an indirect (mutual) recursion chain started by the calls present here. Therefore only the call sites and the macro invocation must be investigated to determine whether they (directly or indirectly) call back to MHD_poll. No other statements or identifiers in this function body can introduce recursion, and there are no other function calls or function-pointer uses in the shown code that would need investigation."
