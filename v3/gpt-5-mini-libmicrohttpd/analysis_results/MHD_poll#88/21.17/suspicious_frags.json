  "explanation": "The provided function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), nor any explicit pointer/array buffer operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. The only operations are: a macro test MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_(daemon) (a boolean-like check), a conditional expression selecting -1 or 0, and calls to MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket. The daemon pointer is not dereferenced or used with string functions in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If those called functions or the macro expand to string.h usage, they must be inspected in their own definitions, but they are outside the given code fragment.)"
