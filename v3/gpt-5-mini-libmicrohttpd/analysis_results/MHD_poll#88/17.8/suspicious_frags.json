  "explanation": "The flagged fragments include every use and the declaration of the function parameters so that reviewers can check for any modification of parameters (including possible side effects in macros or callees). Other parts of the function need not be investigated because there are no assignments, increments/decrements, compound assignments, or address-of operations applied to the parameters within this function body. The pointer parameter is only passed to macros/functions (permitted: the object pointed to may be modified, but the pointer itself must not be altered) and the scalar parameter is only read (used in a ternary) \u2014 there are no direct modifications to either parameter in the remaining code."
