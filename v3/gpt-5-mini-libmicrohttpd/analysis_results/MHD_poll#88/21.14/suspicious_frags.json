  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in the provided code. The function MHD_poll contains no calls to memcmp, nor any direct string or char-buffer comparisons (no uses of char* comparisons, no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp occurrences). The only operations are a macro predicate (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_) and calls to MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket; the macro name and these calls do not themselves indicate use of memcmp within this snippet. Any memcmp usage (and potential misuse per Rule 21.14) would have to be located in other code not included here, so there are no fragments in the given code that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
