  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_poll:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nMHD_poll (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n          int may_block)\n{\n  if (! MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon))\n    return MHD_poll_all (daemon,\n                         may_block ? -1 : 0);\n  return MHD_poll_listen_socket (daemon,\n                                 may_block);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon))\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the condition depends on the runtime value of daemon/MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ and therefore is not dead code. A concrete violation scenario would be if MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ is effectively constant and one branch is executed but has no effect (i.e. both branches have identical behaviour and side-effects), making the executed operation removable without changing program behaviour \u2014 then the conditional and the redundant call would constitute dead code."
