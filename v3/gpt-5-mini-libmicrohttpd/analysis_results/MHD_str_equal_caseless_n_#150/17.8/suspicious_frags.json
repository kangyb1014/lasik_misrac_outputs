  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are: two pointers declared as const char *const (str1 and str2) and a size_t (maxlen). The code only reads from str1 and str2 via indexing (const char c1 = str1[i]; const char c2 = str2[i];), makes no assignments to either pointer or to the pointed-to objects, and does not reassign maxlen. The loop modifies only the local variable i (allowed). The call to charsequalcaseless passes char values by value, so no pointer parameter is modified. Therefore no parameter is being modified and no code fragments require further investigation under Rule 17.8."
