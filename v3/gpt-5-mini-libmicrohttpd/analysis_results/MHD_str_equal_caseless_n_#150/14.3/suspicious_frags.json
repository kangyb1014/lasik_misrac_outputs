  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All controlling expressions in the function are variant at runtime and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: \n\n- for (i = 0; i < maxlen; ++i): the loop condition depends on the parameter maxlen and the loop variable i, which changes each iteration, so it is not invariant.\n- if (0 == c2): c2 is loaded from str2[i], which varies with i (and depends on the runtime contents of str2), so the condition is not invariant.\n- if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2)): the function call is based on c1 and c2 (both from str1[i] and str2[i]) and may produce different results across iterations; it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n\nThere are no do-while loops, no while(1)/for(;;) infinite loops, and no constant literal conditions (e.g. if (1) or if (0)) in this function. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
