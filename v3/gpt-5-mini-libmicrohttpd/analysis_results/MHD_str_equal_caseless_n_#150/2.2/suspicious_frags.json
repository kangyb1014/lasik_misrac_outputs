Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the function (function signature, size_t i declaration, the for-loop header and its increment/termination, and the loop braces) are structural and clearly contribute to control flow and variable lifetime; they are not candidate dead code. The loop index and loop condition are used to limit comparisons, and the early-return statements inside the loop (apart from the fragments listed above) are the only ways to exit early; none of those structural elements are redundant or executed without effect. Therefore only the fragments listed above warrant further investigation for potential dead-code issues."
