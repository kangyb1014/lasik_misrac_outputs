  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the supplied code. All comparisons are performed on individual characters (c1, c2) and by calling charsequalcaseless for single-character case-insensitive comparison; the code checks for the NUL terminator explicitly (if (0 == c2) return 0 == c1;). There is no multi-byte or block comparison (no memcmp-like pattern) in the loop or elsewhere in this function. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that match or suggest use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and none require investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
