  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. That rule specifically concerns the use of the standard string.h library functions (memcpy, strlen, strcpy, etc.) and forbids using them in a way that accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ does not call any functions from <string.h>; it performs direct indexed accesses (str1[i], str2[i]). Therefore Rule 21.17 does not apply to this code.\n\nThat said, the agent\u2019s scenario correctly describes a real out-of-bounds read risk: if callers pass a buffer for str1 that is shorter than maxlen (or not NUL-terminated) while str2 has matching bytes up to maxlen, the function will read str1[i] beyond its bounds. That is a separate correctness/safety defect (an out-of-bounds access) and could violate other MISRA constraints about undefined behavior and pointer/array bounds, but it is not a violation of Rule 21.17 itself."
