  "scenario": "If str2 does not have a valid NUL terminator within the first maxlen bytes (for example str2 points to a buffer allocated with size < maxlen and not NUL-terminated), the expression str2[i] will read past the object bounds when i reaches the buffer length \u2014 undefined behaviour. Thus the code can access beyond the bounds of the object referenced by str2 (also dereferencing a NULL str2 would be a violation)."
