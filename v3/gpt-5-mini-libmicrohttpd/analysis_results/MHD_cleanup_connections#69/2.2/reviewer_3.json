  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The assignment pos->rp.response = NULL is executed immediately before free(pos) and the field is not used again between that assignment and the free. Removing that single assignment would not change program behaviour (the response was already destroyed by MHD_destroy_response and the whole containing object is then freed), so under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 this is dead code. The only caveats are non-standard concerns (debugging instrumentation, memory-sanitizers, or undefined concurrent accesses that might observe the write before the free) \u2014 those are not normal program behaviour considerations for this rule. If the write was intentionally left to assist debugging or sanitizers, that should be documented and formally justified; otherwise the assignment should be removed. Therefore the agent A report is correct."
