  "explanation": "I included every runtime controlling expression (the loop and all if conditions) that could potentially be an invariant and thus relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. I did not include preprocessor conditionals (#if/#ifdef) because those are compile-time directives rather than C-language controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. I also excluded non-controlling statements (assignments, function calls that are not used as controlling expressions, and macros used only inside assertions) since they are not subject to this rule. The listed fragments therefore cover all runtime control expressions in the function that other reviewers should inspect for possible invariance."
