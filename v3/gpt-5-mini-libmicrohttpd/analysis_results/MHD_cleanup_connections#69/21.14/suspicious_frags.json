  "explanation": "I scanned the provided MHD_cleanup_connections function for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any obvious comparisons of null-terminated strings performed via memcmp. No occurrences of memcmp (direct calls or obvious macro expansions invoking memcmp) are present in this code fragment. The comparisons in the function are pointer/flag checks (e.g. NULL != pos->rp.response, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != pos->socket_fd), integer/bitmask tests, and calls to other functions (e.g. epoll_ctl, gnutls_deinit, MHD_destroy_response). None of these are memcmp-based string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: calls to external functions/macros referenced here could internally use memcmp, but detecting that would require inspecting those function/macro implementations, which are outside the supplied code fragment.)"
