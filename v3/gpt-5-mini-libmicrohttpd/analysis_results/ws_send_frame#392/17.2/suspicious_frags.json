  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect recursive calls. The only call in this function that could be user-defined and therefore possibly call back into ws_send_frame is send_all; that call (and the surrounding loop/CLIENT_SOCKS access which invokes it for other clients) should be investigated for indirect recursion. Other fragments in the function are assignments, buffer construction, or calls to standard library/OS functions (malloc, free, pthread_mutex_lock/unlock, abort) which do not invoke application-level callbacks that could lead to indirect recursion, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
