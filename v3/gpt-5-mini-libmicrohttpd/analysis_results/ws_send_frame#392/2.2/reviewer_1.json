The buffer was allocated with an extra byte, but that terminator is never read or relied upon: send_all is invoked with idx_response (the length) and only bytes [0..idx_response-1] are sent. Removing this assignment would not change program behaviour, so the assignment is an executed operation whose removal does not affect behaviour \u2014 i.e. dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The assignment response[idx_response] = '\\0'; stores a NUL byte into the one extra byte allocated (idx_first_rdata + length + 1) at index idx_response == idx_first_rdata + length. The code then calls send_all with idx_response (the length) so the terminator byte is never sent, never read, and the buffer is freed afterwards. Nothing else in the function or shown code relies on that stored NUL. Therefore that executed assignment can be removed without changing program behaviour, which matches MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code. The report is correct."
