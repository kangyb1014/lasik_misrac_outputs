  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire MHD_get_timeout64 function. There are no calls to any of the Standard Library string functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function only performs pointer/structure traversals, integer arithmetic (e.g. pos->last_activity + pos->connection_timeout_ms), simple assignments to *timeout64, and calls to other functions/macros (MHD_DLOG, connection_get_wait). None of these fragments directly invoke or appear to use string.h functions or do buffer copies that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no code fragments within this function that need investigation for Rule 21.17. Note: if you want to be certain about library-string usage you should inspect the definitions/implementations of the called macros/functions (e.g. MHD_DLOG, connection_get_wait) outside this snippet, because they could internally use string.h functions; however, those definitions are not present in the provided code and so are outside the scope of this function-level review."
