  "explanation": "I reported all control-statement expressions (assert macro condition, all if conditions and the for loop header) because Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions; these are the only places in this function where a controlling expression occurs. Other code fragments \u2014 declarations, assignments, arithmetic expressions, return statements, comments and preprocessor directives (e.g. #ifdef/#endif blocks) \u2014 are not controlling expressions in C and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and do not need to be investigated for invariant controlling expressions."
