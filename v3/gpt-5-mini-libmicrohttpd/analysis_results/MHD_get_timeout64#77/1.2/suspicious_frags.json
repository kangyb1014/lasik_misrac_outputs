  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __asm__, Microsoft __declspec, typeof, typeof_unqual, statement-expressions, inline-assembler, hex float literals, extended integer types, built-in compiler keywords, nonstandard pragmas, or other vendor-specific language constructs). None were found.\n\nSpecific checks and findings:\n- No use of __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (compiler-specific spellings), __declspec, or other vendor attributes/keywords.\n- No use of typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, or other GNU extensions.\n- No inline assembly or pragma directives beyond standard #ifdef/#endif preprocessor conditionals.\n- The backslash shown in the mhd_assert line is a standard preprocessor line-continuation (not a language extension).\n- The /**< ... */ comment is a normal C /* ... */ comment containing a '<' character (commonly used for Doxygen), not a language extension.\n- Use of uint64_t is from the standard stdint.h (C99), not a compiler extension.\n- All constructs (enum return type, pointer usage, arithmetic on uint64_t, conditional compilation) are standard C features.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
