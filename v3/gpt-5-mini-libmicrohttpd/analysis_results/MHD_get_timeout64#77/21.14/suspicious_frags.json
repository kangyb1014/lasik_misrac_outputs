  "explanation": "No use of memcmp (or other standard-library string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appears in the provided function. The code only performs pointer checks, integer/uint64_t arithmetic, structure field accesses, and control-flow; conditional macros (MHD_DLOG, _, EPOLL_SUPPORT, etc.) are logging/compile-time conditionals and do not show any memcmp usage in this fragment. Therefore there are no places in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usage exists it would be in other files or inside macros not expanded here; those are not present in the shown code, so nothing to report."
