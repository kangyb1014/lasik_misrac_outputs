True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointers 'pos' and 'earliest_tmot_conn' are declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *' but in this function they are only used for read-only access (fields are inspected and the pointer is passed to a getter). They could be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *' instead. The assignment 'earliest_tmot_conn = pos;' therefore reflects a missing const qualification and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 unless there is a downstream need to modify the connection via these pointers (or an API such as connection_get_wait requires a non-const pointer).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is plausible but not provably correct from the snippet alone. pos and earliest_tmot_conn are only used for reading fields and following prevX, so within this function they could be declared as pointers-to-const. However, the function passes earliest_tmot_conn to connection_get_wait(\u2026), and we do not have that function\u2019s prototype. If connection_get_wait requires a non-const pointer (i.e. its parameter type is struct MHD_Connection *), then you cannot simply change earliest_tmot_conn\u2019s declared type to const without either changing the callee\u2019s prototype or performing a cast (the latter would be undesirable and could violate other MISRA rules). Conversely, if connection_get_wait\u2019s parameter can be made (or already is) const-qualified, then changing these local pointers to const would be a correct remediation for Rule 8.13.\n\nConclusion: there is insufficient evidence in the provided code to declare a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. You must inspect the prototype of connection_get_wait (and any other uses) to see whether const qualification is possible. If connection_get_wait requires a non-const pointer and cannot be changed, then the current code is acceptable; otherwise the pointers should be made const to satisfy Rule 8.13."
