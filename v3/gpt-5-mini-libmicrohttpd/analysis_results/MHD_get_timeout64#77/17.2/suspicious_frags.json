  "explanation": "I selected all function calls and function-like macro invocations present in the function body because those are the only constructs that can cause direct or indirect calls back into MHD_get_timeout64. Other fragments in the function are simple variable declarations, pointer/field accesses (e.g. daemon->data_already_pending, pos->last_activity, pos->prevX), comparisons, arithmetic, control flow (if, for), assignments, and returns; none of these by themselves invoke functions and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion. Comments and constant initialisations (e.g. earliest_deadline = 0) likewise cannot cause recursion. Thus only the listed function/macro call sites require investigation for potential self-call (direct or indirect) paths."
