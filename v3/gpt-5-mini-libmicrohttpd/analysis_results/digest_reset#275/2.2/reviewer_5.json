In that configuration it is dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert expands to a real runtime check (e.g. calls abort/logs on failure), then the assertion is not dead and does not violate the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in the sense claimed. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If in the project configuration mhd_assert is defined as a no-op (for example #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0)), each mhd_assert(...) call in digest_reset becomes an executed no-op statement whose removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 i.e. dead code \u2014 so the project would violate Rule 2.2. Conversely, if mhd_assert expands to a real runtime check (with observable behaviour on failure), then those statements are not dead and do not violate Rule 2.2. Whether a violation exists therefore depends on how mhd_assert is defined in the project configuration; the agent's conditional claim is correct."
