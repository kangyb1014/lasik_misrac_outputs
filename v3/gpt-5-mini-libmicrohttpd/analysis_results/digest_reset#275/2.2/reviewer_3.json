Removing that statement (or compiling with assertions disabled) would not change the program behaviour in the release configuration, so the operation is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour in the project. In this case mhd_assert(! da->hashing); is a diagnostic check that (by the scenario) is active in debug builds and a no-op in release builds. Because the assertion can affect behaviour in at least one project configuration (e.g. aborting, logging, or otherwise changing control flow when the condition fails in a debug build), removing the assertion from the source would change behaviour of the project in that configuration. Therefore the statement is not dead code for the project as a whole. Only if the mhd_assert macro were defined as a no-op in every project configuration (i.e. it never has any observable effect anywhere in the project) would the assertion be dead code and subject to Rule 2.2. The agent A\u2019s reasoning incorrectly treats a release-only no-op as proof of a project-level dead-code violation; that is not sufficient under MISRA Rule 2.2."
