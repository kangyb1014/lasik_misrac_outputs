  "explanation": "I found no explicit compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens present such as __attribute__, __asm, __asm__, __inline__, __typeof__, __builtin_*, __declspec, __extension__, or other vendor-specific extensions.\n- The identifier _MHD_static_inline is just a macro identifier in the source; its expansion (which might contain an extension) is not shown here, so it cannot be treated as an explicit use of a compiler extension in this fragment.\n- Conditional compilation (#ifdef / #endif) and the placement of preprocessor conditionals around else/if blocks are standard preprocessor usage, not language extensions.\n- Use of identifiers like _DEBUG or names beginning with an underscore are reserved by the implementation but are not compiler language extensions per se and thus do not trigger Rule 1.2 by themselves.\n- Calls to MHD_MD5_reset, MHD_SHA256_reset, mhd_assert, and use of true/false are ordinary identifiers/macros or standard C boolean usage (true/false require stdbool.h but are not compiler extensions in the code shown).\n\nTo flag a suspicious fragment under Rule 1.2 I would need explicit extension syntax visible in the code (e.g. __attribute__((...)), __asm, __builtin_..., __inline__ used as a language extension, pragmas specific to a compiler, etc.). None of those appear in the provided snippet."
