  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons: \n\n- The function parameter is `struct DigestAlgorithm *da`. This function intentionally mutates the DigestAlgorithm instance (calls to reset/init functions and assignments like `da->ready_for_hashing = true` in debug builds), so the pointer must be non-const and cannot be changed to `const`.\n\n- The address-of usages (e.g. `&da->ctx.md5_ctx`, `&da->ctx.sha256_ctx`, `&da->ctx.sha512_256_ctx`) are passed to reset/init functions which by their purpose modify those context structures. Those targets therefore must be non-const; making them const would be incorrect.\n\n- The various `mhd_assert` and algorithm-selection checks only read fields, but they are part of a function that also writes state; the overall parameter cannot be const while parts are written.\n\n- There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables in this fragment that could be const-qualified without changing semantics.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer uses in this code fragment that violate or are likely to violate Rule 8.13 \u2014 all non-const pointers are used to modify state and thus should remain non-const."
