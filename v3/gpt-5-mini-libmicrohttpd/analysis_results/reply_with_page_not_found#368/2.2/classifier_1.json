  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of reply_with_page_not_found:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreply_with_page_not_found (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  static const char page_content[] =\n    \"<html><head><title>Page Not Found</title></head>\" \\\n    \"<body>The requested page not found.</body></html>\";\n  static const size_t page_content_len =\n    (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n  struct MHD_Response *resp;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  resp = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (page_content_len,\n                                                 page_content);\n  if (NULL == resp)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  /* Ignore possible error when adding the header as the reply will work even\n     without this header. */\n  (void) MHD_add_response_header (resp,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                  \"text/html\");\n\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (c, MHD_HTTP_NOT_FOUND, resp);\n  MHD_destroy_response (resp);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void) MHD_add_response_header (resp,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                  \"text/html\");\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to MHD_add_response_header has an observable side effect (it attempts to add a header to the response); removing the call would change program behaviour (the header may be absent). The (void) cast only discards the return value and does not make the call dead. Only if MHD_add_response_header were a pure function with no side effects and its removal had no effect would this be dead code."
