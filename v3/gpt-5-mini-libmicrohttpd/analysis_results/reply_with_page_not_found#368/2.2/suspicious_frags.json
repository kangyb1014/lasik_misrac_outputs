  "explanation": "The remaining fragments are not candidates for dead-code investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the page_content array and page_content_len are initializations (initialization is not treated as an assignment and thus not dead code). The call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and the subsequent NULL check are used to produce and validate the response object. The ret variable receives the result of MHD_queue_response which is then returned, so those operations affect program behaviour. Comments and string literals are not executable code. Therefore these parts need not be investigated for dead code."
