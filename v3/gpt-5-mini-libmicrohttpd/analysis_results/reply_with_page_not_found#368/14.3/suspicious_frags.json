  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant conditions. The only conditional is \"if (NULL == resp)\" which depends on the runtime value of resp and is therefore not invariant. The static/const data (page_content and page_content_len) are compile-time constants but are not used as controlling expressions. The (void) cast on MHD_add_response_header simply discards a return value and is not a control construct. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
