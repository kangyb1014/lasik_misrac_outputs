  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions found. All conditional and loop controlling expressions depend on variables that can change at runtime: \n- if (! context || ! Message_Digest) depends on the function arguments; not invariant.\n- if (context->corrupted) depends on a structure member that can vary; not invariant.\n- if (! context->computed) depends on a structure member that can vary; not invariant.\n- for (i = 0; i < 64; ++i) uses the loop variable i which is modified each iteration; the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- for (i = 0; i < SHA1HashSize; ++i) likewise uses the loop variable i which changes each iteration; the controlling expression is not invariant.\nNo do-while constant-false or intentional infinite-loop idioms are present. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
