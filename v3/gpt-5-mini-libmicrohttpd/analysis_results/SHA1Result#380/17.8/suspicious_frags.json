  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function assigns to the pointer parameters themselves. The function only reads the pointer values (e.g. if (! context || ! Message_Digest)), dereferences them to modify the objects they point to (e.g. context->computed = 1; context->length_low = 0; Message_Digest[i] = ...), or passes the pointer to another function (SHA1PadMessage(context)). These are permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8: the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified. There are no statements such as `context = ...` or `Message_Digest = ...` that would modify the pointer parameters, so no fragments need investigation for this rule."
