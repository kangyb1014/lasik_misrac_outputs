True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe assignments that clear context->message_block[], context->length_low and context->length_high (the loop and the two length resets) are executed only after SHA1PadMessage has produced the hash and context->computed is set. If no subsequent code reads message_block or the length fields (i.e. their values are not used after computed is true), then those stores only change memory state and their removal would not affect program behaviour. In that situation those operations constitute dead code and therefore violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the snippet alone. Whether those stores are \u201cdead\u201d depends on project-wide use of the context object: if some later code (or external inspection, diagnostics, debugging, or a security requirement) reads message_block or the length fields, or relies on them being zeroed for correctness or information-hiding, then removing the writes would change program behaviour. Even if no functional consumer reads them, the writes may be intentional to clear sensitive data or to guarantee a well-defined context state for future reuse; removing them would therefore alter observable behaviour in those respects. MISRA Rule 2.2 is project scoped, so you must examine the whole project to determine whether the stores are removable with no effect. On the information given, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a violation, so Agent A\u2019s report is not correct."
