  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Result:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Result (struct SHA1Context *context, unsigned char\n            Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize])\n{\n  int i;\n\n  if (! context || !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment context->length_high = 0; is part of resetting the SHA1Context state when finalizing the digest (it clears the high-length field for potential later use). Although this statement is not read later inside this function, its removal could change program behaviour if other code inspects the context after SHA1Result (or if the context is reused). Without whole-program evidence that length_high is never read after this point, the assignment cannot be classified as dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
