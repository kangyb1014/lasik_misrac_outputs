  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function performs only indexed character accesses and direct comparisons (e.g. '\\\\' == quoted[r]) and copies bytes into result using assignments; it uses the explicit quoted_len parameter to bound reads rather than relying on null-terminated strings. There are no calls to string.h or any other functions that would perform a memcmp-based comparison, nor are there patterns like memcmp(... ) == 0 or similar. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
