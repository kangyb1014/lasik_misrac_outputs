  "explanation": "The code contains no calls to the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so direct violations of that rule via standard library string functions are not present. Fragments not listed above (declarations size_t r; size_t w;, the initializations r = 0; w = 0;, the final return w;, and the surrounding braces and function-wide structure) do not perform pointer dereferences that could access object memory beyond known bounds or call string.h functions, and therefore do not require investigation under the stated rule. The selected fragments include all places where the code reads from the quoted buffer or writes to the result buffer (and where index increments occur) and thus are the relevant locations to investigate for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
