  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment ++r increments a local index (r) and is followed by a bounds check (if (quoted_len == r) return 0) before any further access to quoted[r]. Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), none of which are used here, so this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
