  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __attribute__((...)), __declspec, etc.).\n- No GCC/Clang statement expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions.\n- No inline assembly or pragma-specific constructs.\n- No use of compiler-specific integer/float suffixes or nonstandard type names; only size_t (standard C type) and standard pointer/char types are used.\n- All control structures and operators (if, while, ++, post-increment in expressions, array indexing) are standard C; the backslash escape in the character literal and the string literal semantics are standard.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that match the MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 criterion (use of documented compiler language extensions) and nothing in this function needs investigation for that rule."
