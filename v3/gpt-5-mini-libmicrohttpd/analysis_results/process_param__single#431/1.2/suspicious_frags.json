  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically checked and found none of the following common extensions: __attribute__ or other __... annotations, __asm / asm inline assembly, GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, typeof or __typeof__, __builtin_* functions, non-standard member or bit-field extensions, anonymous structures/unions as an extension, or other compiler-specific keywords. The code uses only standard C features: enum return type, static function, standard logical operator (!), ternary operator, string literal concatenation, and array indexing. Therefore no code fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
