  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter is declared as const char * (already const-qualified), so the pointer declaration itself complies with the rule; indexing param_name (param_name[1]) yields a char value, not a pointer type; the return expression uses enum constants and does not involve pointer declarations; tool_params.* members referenced here are used as scalar flags (no pointer usage in this snippet). The only places where pointer const-qualification might warrant checking are the two fprintf calls that pass param_name through varargs, so they are reported for investigation."
