  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The code contains two if-statements and one conditional (?:) expression \u2014 these are the only control expressions in this function and thus the only fragments that could be invariant and require investigation. Other lines are not controlling expressions and therefore not subject to this rule: the fprintf calls are simple function calls, the assignment `tool_params.single = ! 0;` is an assignment (not a controlling expression) \u2014 although it uses a constant expression, Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions only \u2014 and the function signature/returns and string literals are not control constructs. No other if/for/while/do/switch/conditional operators appear in the function, so no additional fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
