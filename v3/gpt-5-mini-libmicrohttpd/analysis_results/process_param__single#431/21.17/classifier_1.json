  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the code uses fprintf (stdio) with \"%s\", not one of the <string.h> functions listed in Rule 21.17 (memcpy/strcpy/etc.), so Rule 21.17 is not directly violated. Note: if param_name is not a valid NUL-terminated string or is an invalid pointer, the \"%s\" conversion would read beyond the object bounds (undefined behaviour), but that is a general runtime/validation issue rather than a violation of Rule 21.17 as stated."
