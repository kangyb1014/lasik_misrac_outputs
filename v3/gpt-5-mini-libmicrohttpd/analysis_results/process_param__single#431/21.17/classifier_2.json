  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 is not violated: the fragment does not call any functions from <string.h>. However, the expression param_name[1] can cause an out-of-bounds access (or undefined behavior) if param_name is NULL or points to a string shorter than 2 characters; that would violate bounds-related rules (not 21.17)."
