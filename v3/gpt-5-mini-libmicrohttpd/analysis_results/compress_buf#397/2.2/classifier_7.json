  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of compress_buf:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncompress_buf (z_stream *strm, const void *src, size_t src_size, size_t *offset,\n              void **dest, size_t *dest_size,\n              void *tmp)\n{\n  unsigned int have;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  int flush;\n  void *tmp_dest;\n  *dest = NULL;\n  *dest_size = 0;\n  do\n  {\n    if (src_size > CHUNK)\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = CHUNK;\n      src_size -= CHUNK;\n      flush = Z_NO_FLUSH;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = (uInt) src_size;\n      flush = Z_SYNC_FLUSH;\n    }\n    *offset += strm->avail_in;\n    strm->next_in = (const Bytef *) src;\n    do\n    {\n      strm->avail_out = CHUNK;\n      strm->next_out = tmp;\n      ret = (Z_OK == deflate (strm, flush)) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment '*dest_size = 0;' initializes the output parameter before the subsequent '*dest_size += have;' updates in the loop. Removing it would change the computed *dest_size (unless the caller had already set it to 0), so the operation affects program behaviour and is not dead code. Note 3 of the rule also indicates initialization/assignment of output parameters is not considered dead code."
