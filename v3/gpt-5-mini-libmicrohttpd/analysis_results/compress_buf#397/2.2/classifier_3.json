  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of compress_buf:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncompress_buf (z_stream *strm, const void *src, size_t src_size, size_t *offset,\n              void **dest, size_t *dest_size,\n              void *tmp)\n{\n  unsigned int have;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  int flush;\n  void *tmp_dest;\n  *dest = NULL;\n  *dest_size = 0;\n  do\n  {\n    if (src_size > CHUNK)\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = CHUNK;\n      src_size -= CHUNK;\n      flush = Z_NO_FLUSH;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = (uInt) src_size;\n      flush = Z_SYNC_FLUSH;\n    }\n    *offset += strm->avail_in;\n    strm->next_in = (const Bytef *) src;\n    do\n    {\n      strm->avail_out = CHUNK;\n      strm->next_out = tmp;\n      ret = (Z_OK == deflate (strm, flush)) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "is_rule_violated = false. The assignment '*offset += strm->avail_in;' modifies memory visible to the caller (the size_t object pointed to by offset) to accumulate the number of input bytes processed. Removing this statement would change observable program behaviour at the call boundary (the caller would no longer see the updated offset), so it is not dead code. (Only in the special case where the caller never reads the pointed-to value or passes an address that is intentionally ignored would the update be effectively dead, but that is a caller-side issue, not dead code inside this function.)"
