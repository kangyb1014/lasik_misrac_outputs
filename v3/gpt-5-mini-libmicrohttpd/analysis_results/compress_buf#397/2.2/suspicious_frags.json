  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not considered suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they participate directly in the function's observable behaviour (loop control, zlib interaction, memory allocation, copying of output, and the return value). The following reasons justify not including other lines: - The CHUNK/avail_in/avail_out assignments and the inner/outer loop constructs control how much data is passed to deflate and when the function repeats; removing them would change execution behaviour. - The use of have, *dest_size accumulation, and subsequent realloc/memcpy are the mechanism by which compressed output is accumulated; these have clear side effects on the output buffer and its size. - The initial declarations of local variables (have, ret, flush, tmp_dest) are necessary for subsequent operations. - The return ret; at the end is the function's observable result. - The casts (e.g. (uInt) src_size, (const Bytef *) src) and the call to deflate are not dead: they affect behaviour via zlib state and outputs. Therefore those code fragments were not flagged as potential dead code."
