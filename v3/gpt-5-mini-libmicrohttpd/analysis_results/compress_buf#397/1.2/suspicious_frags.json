  "explanation": "I found no usage of compiler language extensions in the provided function. I looked for common vendor/extension constructs such as identifiers or keywords starting with __ (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__), GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }) or typeof, MSVC-specific extensions, nonstandard inline/asm pragmas, bit-field width extensions, or other documented compiler extensions \u2014 none are present. The types uInt and Bytef are zlib typedefs (library types), not compiler extensions. All casts, standard library calls (realloc, free, memcpy), control structures, and enum usage are standard C constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
