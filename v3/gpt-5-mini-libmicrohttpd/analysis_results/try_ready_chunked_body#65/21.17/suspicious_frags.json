  "explanation": "I flagged all uses of the <string.h> function memcpy present in the function plus the related buffer write/index operations and the calculation of size_to_fill and chunk_hdr_len that determine memcpy arguments and write offsets. Those fragments are the locations most likely to lead to accesses beyond the bounds of the destination/source buffers and thus require investigation for MISRA C Rule 21.17 compliance. Other code in the function was not listed because it does not call the standard string.h functions or is protected by explicit size computations, assertions, and early error paths: e.g. the code that grows/limits connection->write_buffer ensures (via checks and mhd_assert) that connection->write_buffer_size is at least max_chunk_overhead, the checks that cap size_to_fill by max_chunk and left_to_send, the cast/compare that enforces ((size_t) ret) <= size_to_fill with an error return when violated, and the MHD_uint32_to_strx call whose return is asserted to be less than sizeof(chunk_hdr). These protections reduce the need to investigate other fragments for out-of-bounds string.h usage."
