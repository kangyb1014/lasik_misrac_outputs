  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe mhd_assert call is a diagnostic assertion macro that, in typical builds, expands to no code (e.g. to (void)0) when diagnostics are disabled. In that configuration the statement has no effect and its removal would not change program behaviour, therefore it constitutes dead code (violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2). Note: if mhd_assert is implemented to have observable side-effects (e.g. calls a failure handler/aborts) then it would not be dead code; the violation applies when the macro is a no-op in production builds.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified try_ready_chunked_body code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/652.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of try_ready_chunked_body as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of try_ready_chunked_body:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ntry_ready_chunked_body (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                        bool *p_finished)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  static const size_t max_chunk = 0xFFFFFF;\n  char chunk_hdr[6];            /* 6: max strlen of \"FFFFFF\" */\n  /* \"FFFFFF\" + \"\\r\\n\" */\n  static const size_t max_chunk_hdr_len = sizeof(chunk_hdr) + 2;\n  /* \"FFFFFF\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" (chunk termination) */\n  static const size_t max_chunk_overhead = sizeof(chunk_hdr) + 2 + 2;\n  size_t chunk_hdr_len;\n  uint64_t left_to_send;\n  size_t size_to_fill;\n\n  response = connection->rp.response;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != response->crc || NULL != response->data);\n\n  mhd_assert (0 == connection->write_buffer_append_offset);\n\n  /* The buffer must be reasonably large enough */\n  if (128 > connection->write_buffer_size)\n  {\n    size_t size;\n\n    size = connection->write_buffer_size + MHD_pool_get_free (connection->pool);\n    if (128 > size)\n    {\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n      MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n      /* not enough memory */\n      CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                              _ (\"Closing connection (out of memory).\"));\n      return MHD_NO;\n    }\n    /* Limit the buffer size to the largest usable size for chunks */\n    if ( (max_chunk + max_chunk_overhead) < size)\n      size = max_chunk + max_chunk_overhead;\n    mhd_assert ((NULL == connection->write_buffer) || \\\n                MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (connection->pool, \\\n                                               connection->write_buffer, \\\n                                               connection->write_buffer_size));\n    connection->write_buffer =\n      MHD_pool_reallocate (connection->pool,\n                           connection->write_buffer,\n                           connection->write_buffer_size,\n                           size);\n    mhd_assert (NULL != connection->write_buffer);\n    connection->write_buffer_size = size;\n  }\n  mhd_assert (max_chunk_overhead < connection->write_buffer_size);\n\n  if (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN == response->total_size)\n    left_to_send = MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN;\n  else\n    left_to_send = response->total_size\n                   - connection->rp.rsp_write_position;\n\n  size_to_fill = connection->write_buffer_size - max_chunk_overhead;\n  /* Limit size for the callback to the max usable size */\n  if (max_chunk < size_to_fill)\n    size_to_fill = max_chunk;\n  if (left_to_send < size_to_fill)\n    size_to_fill = (size_t) left_to_send;\n\n  if (0 == left_to_send)\n    /* nothing to send, don't bother calling crc */\n    ret = MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;\n  else if ( (response->data_start <=\n             connection->rp.rsp_write_position) &&\n            (response->data_start + response->data_size >\n             connection->rp.rsp_write_position) )\n  {\n    /* difference between rsp_write_position and data_start is less\n       than data_size which is size_t type, no need to check for overflow */\n    const size_t data_write_offset\n      = (size_t) (connection->rp.rsp_write_position\n                  - response->data_start);\n    /* buffer already ready, use what is there for the chunk */\n    mhd_assert (SSIZE_MAX >= (response->data_size - data_write_offset));\n    mhd_assert (response->data_size >= data_write_offset);\n    ret = (ssize_t) (response->data_size - data_write_offset);\n    if ( ((size_t) ret) > size_to_fill)\n      ret = (ssize_t) size_to_fill;\n    memcpy (&connection->write_buffer[max_chunk_hdr_len],\n            &response->data[data_write_offset],\n            (size_t) ret);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    if (NULL == response->crc)\n    { /* There is no way to reach this code */\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n      MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n      CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                              _ (\"No callback for the chunked data.\"));\n      return MHD_NO;\n    }\n    ret = response->crc (response->crc_cls,\n                         connection->rp.rsp_write_position,\n                         &connection->write_buffer[max_chunk_hdr_len],\n                         size_to_fill);\n  }\n  if (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR == ret)\n  {\n    /* error, close socket!
