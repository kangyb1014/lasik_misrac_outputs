  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or identifiers (for example no leading __ or compiler pragmas, attributes like __attribute__, __declspec, or asm). \n- There is no use of GNU statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline assembly, or other known vendor extensions.\n- The use of bool is from standard C99/_Bool (stdbool.h) and is not a compiler extension in modern C; if the project targets a pre\u2011C99 compiler that implements bool as an extension, that would be a toolchain issue to verify against the compiler documentation (not evident in the source itself).\n- All other constructs (static, function definition, pointer parameter, array indexing, character literals, return) are standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that should be flagged for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want further checking for toolchain-specific extensions (e.g., compiling in pre\u2011C99 mode where bool is nonstandard), provide the compiler/version and its documented extensions."
