  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns the const-qualification of pointer-referenced types. The only entities in this function that can affect compliance are the pointer parameter and its uses. Therefore other parts of the function (the static/return/brace/boolean keywords and control flow) do not need investigation for this rule and are not listed. The listed fragments cover the parameter declaration and every site where that pointer is passed or its pointees are accessed, which are the locations that must be checked to determine whether a const-qualified type should be used."
