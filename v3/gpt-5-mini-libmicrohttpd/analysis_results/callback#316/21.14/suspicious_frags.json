  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The code uses memcpy to copy a known byte count (size_to_copy) from param->response_data to buf and relies on an explicit length param->response_size to control copying. There are no calls to memcmp, no comparisons of strings, and no handling of null-terminated strings (no checks of '\\0' or string functions like strcmp/strncmp). The comments contain only pseudocode and do not introduce any memcmp use. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this callback implementation."
