  "scenario": "No violation. The return is reachable when pos == param->response_size (the comment indicates pos will not exceed the response size, so equality can occur). A violation would occur only if the API contract guaranteed that pos is always strictly less than param->response_size (so pos == param->response_size could never happen) \u2014 in that hypothetical case the if (pos >= param->response_size) branch would be unreachable."
