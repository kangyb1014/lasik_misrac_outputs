  "scenario": "The 'cls' parameter is declared as void * and then cast to a non-const pointer ('struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param') even though the function only reads from the pointed structure. This casts away constness / fails to qualify the pointee as const; per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. use 'const void *cls' and 'const struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param'). The 'buf' parameter is non-const appropriately because it is written to."
