  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. I checked for common compiler-specific extension patterns and tokens that are explicitly described as extensions in compiler documentation, including:\n- nested functions (no function defined inside another function),\n- GCC/Clang statement expressions/compound statements-as-expressions ({ ... }) (no occurrences of \"({\"),\n- typeof or __typeof__ (no occurrences of \"typeof\" or \"__typeof__\"),\n- inline assembly or asm (no \"asm\"/\"__asm__\"),\n- GCC/Clang attributes (no \"__attribute__\"),\n- builtin or compiler intrinsics (no \"__builtin_\" identifiers),\n- labels-as-values (no use of \"&&label\" or computed-goto),\n- use of __extension__, __declspec, or other compiler-specific keywords,\n- pragmas that indicate compiler-specific behavior (no such pragmas present).\n\nThe code uses standard C constructs: static function, pointer casts, standard integer types (uint64_t, size_t, ssize_t), memcpy and macros (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM) \u2014 none of which are language/compiler extensions by themselves. Therefore there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
