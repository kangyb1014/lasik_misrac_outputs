  "explanation": "The only invocation of a string.h function in this snippet is memcpy. The fragments reported include the function signature (types and widths of pos and buf_size), the cast of cls to param, the check that bounds pos against param->response_size, the computation/assignment of size_to_copy (including the subtraction and cast), and the memcpy call itself \u2014 all of which affect whether memcpy may access out of bounds. Other parts of the code do not call any string.h functions and are either pseudo-code comments, return constants, or simple return-value handling; they do not influence the memcpy arguments and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 21.17. No other uses of <string.h> functions appear in the provided code fragment."
