  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this snippet with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The function does not call itself directly, nor does it invoke any other function or function pointer that could obviously call it back: the only external call is memcpy (a library function that will not call user callbacks). The returns use symbolic constants (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM, etc.), which are macros/values, not function calls. The only potentially concerning text are commented pseudo-code lines (inside /* ... */) that describe returning 0 or END_WITH_ERROR and note that \"Callback will be called again on next loop\" \u2014 these are comments only and not executable code in this fragment. Indirect recursion would require an actual call path from within this function into code that re-enters this same callback before it returns; no such call path or function-pointer invocation is present here. If the surrounding system/library invokes the callback reentrantly (for example, if code inside this callback called a library routine that ran the event loop and re-invoked the callback), that would need investigation, but there is no evidence of such a call in this code snippet."
