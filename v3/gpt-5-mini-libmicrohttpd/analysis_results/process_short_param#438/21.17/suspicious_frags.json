  "explanation": "All other branches either call handlers with only string literals (e.g. \"-A\", \"-P\", etc.) or call functions that do not receive pointer parameters derived from the incoming 'param' pointer in this fragment. Those calls do not introduce additional pointer arguments that could cause string.h functions to read beyond the bounds of objects originating from this function, so they do not need to be investigated in the context of Rule 21.17 here. The fprintf call merely prints a single char and does not pass any potentially out-of-bounds string pointer to the standard string handling functions. If deeper inspection is required, the flagged fragments (which pass pointers derived from the external 'param' or access param[0]) should be reviewed along with the implementations of the called handlers to ensure no use of string.h functions reads/writes beyond object bounds."
