  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the presented function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, an enum return type, const char pointers, character indexing and comparisons, pointer arithmetic (param + 1), ordinary function calls, and fprintf with stderr. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __inline__), or nonstandard pragmas. Although some internal helper names contain double underscores (e.g. process_param__all_cpus), identifier naming with double underscores is a reservation rule in the C standard (identifier namespace) rather than a compiler language extension; it is not an explicit compiler extension as required by the MISRA Rule 1.2 check requested here, so it is not reported."
