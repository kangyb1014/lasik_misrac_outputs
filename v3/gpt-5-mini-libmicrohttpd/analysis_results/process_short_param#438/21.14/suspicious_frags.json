  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp (or any other raw memory-compare) \u2014 it only reads param[0] into a char and performs single-character comparisons against character constants, and it passes param+1 to other functions. Thus there is no use of memcmp within this fragment to investigate. Note: the implementations of the called functions (process_param__*) are outside this fragment; if those contain memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings, they should be inspected separately, but they are not present here and therefore are not flagged."
