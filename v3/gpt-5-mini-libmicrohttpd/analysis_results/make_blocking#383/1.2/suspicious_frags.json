  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided function body. The code only uses: standard C constructs (static function, local variable declarations, casts, if-statements), preprocessor conditional compilation (#if/#elif/#endif), and calls to platform APIs (fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort) and standard macros (F_GETFL, O_NONBLOCK, F_SETFL, FIONBIO). Conditional compilation to choose POSIX vs Winsock behavior is a standard, portable technique and not a compiler language extension. The cast (int) FIONBIO and the bitwise operations are standard C. Local variable initialization (unsigned long flags = 0;) is standard C. There are no compiler-specific keywords, attributes, statement expressions, inline asm, or other constructs that would be considered language extensions according to typical compiler documentation. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
