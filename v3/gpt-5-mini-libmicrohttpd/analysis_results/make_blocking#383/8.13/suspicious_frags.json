  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve pointer usage or the possibility that a parameter is a pointer type are reported. The POSIX branch uses only an int 'flags' and calls fcntl with integer arguments (no address-of or pointer declarations), so those lines do not raise Rule 8.13 concerns. The remaining lines (abort calls, bitwise operations on flags, F_GETFL/F_SETFL usage) do not introduce pointer targets that could/should be const-qualified, so they do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
