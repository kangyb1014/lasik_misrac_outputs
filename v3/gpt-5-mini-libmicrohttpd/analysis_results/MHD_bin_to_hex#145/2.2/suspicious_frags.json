  "explanation": "No executed operations in this function qualify as dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Reasoning: \n- Every assignment and computation performed in the loop (loading b, computing j for the high nibble, writing hex[i*2], recomputing j for the low nibble, writing hex[i*2 + 1]) directly affects the resulting hex output. Removing any of these executed operations would change observable program behaviour.\n- The loop control and return value are used: i is incremented by the loop and the function returns i * 2 (which equals size * 2). If size is zero the loop is not executed and returning 0 is meaningful \u2014 this is not dead code but correct handling of the zero-length case.\n- There is no unreachable code in the function (all statements are reachable when the loop iterates), and no initialization that is unused. The temporary variables (b and j) are used in subsequent expressions, so they are not redundant.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for dead code in this function."
