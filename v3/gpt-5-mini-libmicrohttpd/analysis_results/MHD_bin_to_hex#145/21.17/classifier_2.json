  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The fragment does not call any <string.h> function, so Rule 21.17 is not violated. (Note: a different violation would occur if 'bin' does not actually refer to at least 'size' bytes \u2014 e.g. bin points to a smaller buffer or is NULL while size>0 \u2014 because then ((const uint8_t *)bin)[i] would read out of bounds, but that is not a 21.17 string.h-specific violation.)"
