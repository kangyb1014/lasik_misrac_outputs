  "explanation": "I found no places that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. All pointer usages in the function have the pointed-to type const-qualified where possible: the input buffer is declared as const void *bin and is accessed via a cast to const uint8_t *, preserving const qualification. The output buffer hex is written to, so it must be a non-const char * (it cannot be const-qualified). There are no other pointer parameters or pointer targets in the function that could reasonably be made const-qualified. The cast ((const uint8_t *) bin) does not remove const qualification. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 8.13."
