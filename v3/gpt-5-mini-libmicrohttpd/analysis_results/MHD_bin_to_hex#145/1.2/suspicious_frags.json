  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. All constructs are standard C: size_t and uint8_t are standard typedefs from the C standard headers (stddef.h/stdint.h), casts from void* to uint8_t* and array indexing are standard, the ternary operator and char arithmetic are standard, and there are no uses of compiler-specific keywords or extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions, inline asm, nonstandard calling conventions, named registers, Microsoft/GCC-specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no places that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions used)."
