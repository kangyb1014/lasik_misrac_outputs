  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function body contains only local variables, integer/bit operations, array indexing, ternary expressions and casts. There are no function calls (direct or indirect), no use of function pointers, no macros or callback invocations that could expand to calls, and the return statement is a simple expression. Therefore there is no direct or indirect self-call to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
