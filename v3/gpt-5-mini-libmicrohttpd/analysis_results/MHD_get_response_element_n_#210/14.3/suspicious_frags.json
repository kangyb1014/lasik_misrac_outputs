Other code fragments do not contain controlling expressions relevant to MISRA C:14.3 \u2014 e.g. declarations, assignments, return statements, the function signature, and the call expression MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (which is part of the already-listed if-condition) are not separate control constructs and therefore need not be separately investigated for invariant controlling expressions. No do-while or explicit infinite-loop constructs are present that would invoke the stated exceptions."
