  "explanation": "No direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in this function. The only call that could potentially encapsulate a memcmp-based comparison is MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_; therefore that call (and the implementation of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) should be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Other fragments in this function (the loop over headers, the size/kind comparisons, and the mhd_assert checks) do not invoke memcmp and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
