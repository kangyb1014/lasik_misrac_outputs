In normal operation when c->state >= MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED the assertion expression is evaluated (executed) but has no effect on control flow because the following if handles the out-of-range case.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The mhd_assert is a diagnostics/invariant check and not dead code under MISRA 2.2. Although in the normal (successful) path the assertion will evaluate to true and have no observable effect, its presence can change program behaviour when the invariant is violated (e.g. logging, trapping or aborting), so removal would alter behaviour for those executions. MISRA 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; here removal would affect behaviour in the fault case. Moreover, the following if (...) return false; is not semantically equivalent to the assertion (it handles the condition differently), so the assert is not merely redundant. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
