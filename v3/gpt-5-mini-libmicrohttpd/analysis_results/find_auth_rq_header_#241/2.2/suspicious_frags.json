The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are likely candidates for dead or redundant operations or that depend on conditional compilation (so they may be compiled in but never executed in some project configurations): assertions, the compile-time DAUTH/BAUTH blocks and their fallback (mhd_assert(0); return false;), several length/compare checks and the whitespace-handling branch. These deserve investigation because, depending on compile-time flags, enum values present in the project, or earlier checks, they may be executed yet removable without changing behavior (or may be redundant).\n\nOther code fragments in the function were not selected because they implement the core header-iteration and matching logic (the for loop, the h->kind check, the sequence of comparisons and the final return false), and interact with external state (the connection/headers). Those constructs are essential to the function\u2019s behaviour and are not obviously dead or redundant without broader program context. Also, low-level assignments that are part of the match result (setting auth_value->str/len) are required for correct output when a match is found. Conditional compilation means reachability depends on build configuration; I only flagged the preprocessor blocks and their fallback assertion as suspicious rather than every use of those macros."
