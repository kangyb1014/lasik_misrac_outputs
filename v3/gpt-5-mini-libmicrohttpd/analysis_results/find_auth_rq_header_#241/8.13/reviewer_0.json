If auth_value->str is declared as char * (non-const) then auth_value->str = h->value + token_len assigns a const char * to a non-const pointer, violating the requirement that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible. Fix by making auth_value->str (and the _MHD_str_w_len definition) const char * (or otherwise ensure types already carry const).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s finding is plausible and (very likely) correct. In the function the code uses a pointer to a const struct: const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *h; later the code does auth_value->str = h->value + token_len (or + token_len + 1). If the MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::value member is declared as const char * (which is a common and likely choice for immutable header storage), while _MHD_str_w_len::str is declared as char * (non-const), that assignment would discard const qualification and therefore is contrary to the intent of MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible). Note also that the const on the pointer to the struct does not change the declared type of the member \u2014 the constness of the member must be checked in the type declaration. If, however, MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::value is declared as char * (non-const), then no const is being discarded and Agent A\u2019s claim would be incorrect. To resolve: inspect the declarations. If value is const char *, make _MHD_str_w_len::str a const char * (and propagate const where appropriate). This removes the const-discard and satisfies MISRA 8.13."
