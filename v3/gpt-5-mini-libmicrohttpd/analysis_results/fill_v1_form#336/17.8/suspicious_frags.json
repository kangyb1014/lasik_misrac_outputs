  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. There are no assignments to the parameter variables (cls, mime, session, connection) and no reassignments of pointer parameters. The (void) cls; line only suppresses an unused-parameter warning and does not change cls. session is only dereferenced for reads (strlen(session->value_1) and passing session to add_session_cookie); modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter (e.g., members of *session) is permitted by Rule 17.8, so calls that may alter the session object do not violate the rule. All other modifications operate on local variables (reply, response) or pass pointers to APIs; none modify the parameter pointers themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
