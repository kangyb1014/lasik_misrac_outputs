  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no use of memcmp. The code only calls strlen and snprintf for string handling; these do not perform comparisons using memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp (directly or via an obvious wrapper) and no function pointers or macros in this fragment that resolve to memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
