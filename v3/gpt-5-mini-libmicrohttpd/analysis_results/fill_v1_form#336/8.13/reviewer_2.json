True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function only reads session->value_1 (no writes to *session are performed in the shown code) yet the parameter is declared as a modifiable pointer (struct Session *session). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (const struct Session *session) when the object is not modified. If add_session_cookie or other callees actually modify the session, a non-const pointer may be required; otherwise the current declaration violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer parameter be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In the snippet the function reads session->value_1, but it also calls add_session_cookie(session, response). If add_session_cookie (or some other callee) modifies the session object, the non-const parameter is required and there is no violation. The report asserts a violation but does not show that the session object (or any object reachable through session) is not modified anywhere in the call chain. To confirm a violation you must inspect the declaration/definition of add_session_cookie and any other callees that receive session; only if none modify session should the parameter be changed to const struct Session *session. Therefore the agent's claim is not proven and should be considered incorrect unless further code shows no modification of session."
