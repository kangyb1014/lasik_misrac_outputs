  "explanation": "The other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'const void *cls' and 'const char *mime' are already const-qualified. The local buffer 'reply' is dynamically allocated, written to via snprintf, and later freed, so it properly must be a non-const char*. MAIN_PAGE is used as a read-only format/string constant (appropriate as const). snprintf writes into the buffer intentionally. Calls such as MHD_add_response_header (with mime), MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response and the use of free follow expected API semantics and do not indicate missing const qualification in this code fragment. Non-pointer locals (slen, ret, response variable itself) are not subject to this pointer const-qualification rule."
