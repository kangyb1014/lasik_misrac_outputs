  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function for use of compiler language extensions. The code does not contain any of the common compiler-specific/extension constructs that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, such as: __attribute__ or other __* identifiers, __builtin_* functions, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, extension keywords, nonstandard pragmas, or compiler-specific library extensions. Casts present ((void)cls, (void *)reply, &free) are standard C, and taking the address of a library function is not a language extension. All control flow, declarations, and library calls used are standard C constructs. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for use of language extensions."
