Leaving such disabled code in the project violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 because the project contains code that cannot be executed or reached.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Code inside #if 0 ... #endif is removed by the preprocessor and therefore is not part of the translation unit or the generated program; MISRA Rule 2.1 concerns unreachable code that exists in the compiled translation unit (e.g. code after a return, or guarded by a condition that is provably always false at compile/run time). Disabled source text excluded by the preprocessor is not \u201cunreachable code\u201d in the sense of the rule. (That said, leaving large #if 0 blocks is poor practice and may be addressed by other project/style rules or recommendations to remove commented-out/disabled code, but it does not, by itself, violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1.)"
