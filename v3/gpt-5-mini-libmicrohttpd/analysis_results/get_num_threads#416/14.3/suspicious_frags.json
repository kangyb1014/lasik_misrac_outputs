  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function are runtime-dependent (they compare variables or results of function calls: if (0 < num_threads), if (0 == num_threads), if (num_proc_cpus >= num_threads)), so they are not invariant constant expressions and do not trigger Rule 14.3. There are no loop controlling expressions in the active code that are constant (no for/while/do-while with constant conditions), and the disabled code blocks are the only places containing constant preprocessor conditions (#if 0). Therefore only the disabled #if 0 blocks are flagged for further investigation."
