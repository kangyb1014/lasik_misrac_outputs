  "explanation": "The function body contains no direct invocation of MHD_set_connection_value_n itself; therefore there is no immediate direct recursion. The only expressions that could hide an indirect recursive call are the function/macro-like tokens and calls listed above. All other fragments (function signature, parameter declarations, the if/return structure, boolean logic and literal constants) are simple syntactic elements and do not perform function calls or introduce call-back paths that could create indirect recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
