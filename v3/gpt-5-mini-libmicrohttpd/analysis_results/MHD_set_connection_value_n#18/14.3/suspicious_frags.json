  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The only controlling expression in the function is the if condition: (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != kind) && ( ((key ? strlen (key) : 0) != key_size) || ((value ? strlen (value) : 0) != value_size) ). This expression is not invariant because:\n- It depends on the parameter 'kind' (so MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != kind can change per call).\n- It uses the runtime values of 'key' and 'value' (the ternary checks and strlen calls depend on the pointers and the strings they refer to).\n- It compares against 'key_size' and 'value_size', which are parameters and thus vary at runtime.\nThere are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other conditional controlling expressions in this snippet that could be constant. Therefore Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) does not appear to be violated and no code fragments need further investigation for this rule."
