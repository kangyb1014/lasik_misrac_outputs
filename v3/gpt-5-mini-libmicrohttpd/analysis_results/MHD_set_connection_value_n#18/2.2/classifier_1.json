  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_connection_value_n:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_connection_value_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                            const char *key,\n                            size_t key_size,\n                            const char *value,\n                            size_t value_size)\n{\n  if ( (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != kind) &&\n       ( ((key ? strlen (key) : 0) != key_size) ||\n         ((value ? strlen (value) : 0) != value_size) ) )\n    return MHD_NO; /* binary zero is allowed only in GET arguments */\n\n  return MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (connection,\n                                              kind,\n                                              key,\n                                              key_size,\n                                              value,\n                                              value_size);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (connection,\n                                              kind,\n                                              key,\n                                              key_size,\n                                              value,\n                                              value_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
