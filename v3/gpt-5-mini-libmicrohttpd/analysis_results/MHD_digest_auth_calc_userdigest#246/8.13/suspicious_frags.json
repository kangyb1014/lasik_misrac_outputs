  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: username, realm and password are already const-qualified (const char *). The address-of operator on the local variable da (e.g. &da passed to digest_init_one_time and digest_deinit) is used to allow those functions to modify the DigestAlgorithm instance, so a const qualification would be inappropriate. Size parameters (bin_buf_size, the results of strlen) are non-pointer scalar values. No other pointer parameters or pointer-returning expressions appear in the shown code that could/should be made const."
