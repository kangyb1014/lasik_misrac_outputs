  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not reported as suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they represent required control flow, initialization/cleanup, or observable effects:\n- The call to digest_init_one_time (and its early return) is necessary to ensure the DigestAlgorithm instance is properly initialized before use; removing it would change program behaviour.\n- The declarations of local variables (struct DigestAlgorithm da; enum MHD_Result ret;) are required for storage and return value; they are not redundant operations.\n- The call digest_deinit(&da) performs cleanup of the algorithm state and must remain to preserve behaviour; it is not dead code.\n- The final return ret; is the required observable return of the function; removing or altering it would change behaviour.\n- The early return MHD_NO when digest_init_one_time fails is reachable and necessary to avoid using an uninitialized algorithm instance.\nThese items therefore do not meet the definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour) and do not require further investigation for Rule 2.2."
