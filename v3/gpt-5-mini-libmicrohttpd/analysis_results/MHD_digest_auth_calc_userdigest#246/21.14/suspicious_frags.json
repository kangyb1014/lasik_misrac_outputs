  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code only calls strlen to obtain lengths and passes those lengths to calc_userdigest; there are no string comparisons performed with memcmp. Other calls in this fragment (digest_init_one_time, get_base_digest_algo, calc_userdigest, digest_get_size, digest_ext_error, digest_deinit) are function calls rather than inline uses of memcmp; based on the shown code none of the visible statements compare null\u2011terminated strings with memcmp, so there are no suspicious fragments to report here. (If verification across the entire codebase is required, the implementations of the called functions should be inspected for any memcmp usage on null\u2011terminated strings.)"
