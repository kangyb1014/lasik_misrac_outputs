  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions. Only conditional/loop controlling expressions are relevant for investigation. The function contains three conditional constructs (the initial check of digest_init_one_time, the size comparison, and the optional digest_ext_error check) and these have been reported. Other parts of the function (variable declarations, function calls used as operands, the calc_userdigest call, digest_deinit, and the return statement) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. The preprocessor guard itself is a compile-time inclusion directive and not a C controlling expression; its enclosed if is included above for investigation. No loops or other conditional constructs are present beyond those listed."
