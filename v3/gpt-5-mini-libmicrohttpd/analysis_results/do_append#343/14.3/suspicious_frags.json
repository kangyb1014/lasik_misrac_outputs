  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (e.g., loops or conditionals whose control expression is a compile-time constant or otherwise always the same). The provided function contains no loops and only three if statements: (1) if (NULL == *ret) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of *ret; (2) if (NULL == (buf = malloc (old_len + size + 1))) \u2014 depends on the runtime result of malloc; (3) if (NULL != *ret) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of *ret. None of these are invariant controlling expressions. There is no do-while with an integer constant expression, and no infinite-loop constructs using constant true. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 14.3."
