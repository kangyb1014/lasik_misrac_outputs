Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of do_append:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ndo_append (char **ret,\n           const char *data,\n           size_t size)\n{\n  char *buf;\n  size_t old_len;\n\n  if (NULL == *ret)\n    old_len = 0;\n  else\n    old_len = strlen (*ret);\n  if (NULL == (buf = malloc (old_len + size + 1)))\n    return MHD_NO;\n  if (NULL != *ret)\n  {\n    memcpy (buf,\n            *ret,\n            old_len);\n    free (*ret);\n  }\n  memcpy (&buf[old_len],\n          data,\n          size);\n  buf[old_len + size] = '\\0';\n  *ret = buf;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemcpy (buf,\n            *ret,\n            old_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If *ret points to an allocated empty string (\"\"), then old_len == 0 while *ret != NULL. In that case memcpy(buf, *ret, old_len) is executed with size 0 (a no-op); removing that memcpy call would not affect program behaviour, so the operation is dead code in that execution scenario. A simple fix is to guard the copy with if (old_len > 0) before calling memcpy."
