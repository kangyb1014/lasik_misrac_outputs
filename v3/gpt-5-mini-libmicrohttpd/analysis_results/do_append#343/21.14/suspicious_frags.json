  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp. It uses strlen to obtain the existing string length and memcpy only to copy raw bytes (not to compare strings), plus malloc/free for allocation \u2014 none of these violate Rule 21.14. There are no other string comparison operations in this fragment that would trigger Rule 21.14, so no code fragments require further investigation for this rule."
