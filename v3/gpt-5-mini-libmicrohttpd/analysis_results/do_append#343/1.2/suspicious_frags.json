  "explanation": "I reviewed every construct in the function and found no use of compiler-specific language extensions. The code uses only standard C features and standard library functions: enum as a return type, static function scope, pointer operations, size_t, const, malloc/ free/ strlen/ memcpy, and ordinary pointer indexing (&buf[old_len]). There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, asm, labels-as-values, transparent unions, or other non-standard keywords or pragmas. The implicit conversion from void* (malloc) to char* is standard in C (not an extension). Any other concerns (e.g. possible allocation-size overflow or lack of overflow checks) are safety/robustness issues but are not language-extension uses and thus are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
