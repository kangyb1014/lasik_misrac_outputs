  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the provided function. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in constructs such as if, switch, for, while, do-while, and conditional (?:) operators. The code contains only function calls, variable declarations, and a return; there are no if/for/while/do/switch statements or ternary operators to inspect. The calls to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response are ordinary function calls and not controlling expressions. The exceptions in the rule (infinite loops or specific do-while constant expressions) are not relevant because no loop constructs exist here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
