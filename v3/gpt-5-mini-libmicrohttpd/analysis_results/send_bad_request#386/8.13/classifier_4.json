  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer \u2018res\u2019 refers to a modifiable response object returned by the library and is passed to MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response which expect and modify a non-const struct MHD_Response *. Because the pointed-to object must be modifiable (and the API returns/accepts a non-const pointer), the pointer cannot be made to point to a const-qualified type. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
