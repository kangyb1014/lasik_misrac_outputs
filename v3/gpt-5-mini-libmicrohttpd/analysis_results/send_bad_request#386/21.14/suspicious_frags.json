  "explanation": "I scanned the provided function and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any wrapper that appears to perform a memcmp-style comparison of null-terminated strings. The function only calls strlen (to obtain the length of BAD_REQUEST_PAGE) and Libmicrohttpd APIs (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). Using strlen to obtain the buffer length is appropriate here (it does not perform a memcmp), and the buffer is passed with an explicit length, so there is no hidden comparison of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
