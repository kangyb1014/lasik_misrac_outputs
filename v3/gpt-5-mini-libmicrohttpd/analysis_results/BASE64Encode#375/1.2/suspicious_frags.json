  "explanation": "All other code in the snippet uses standard ISO C constructs (macros, pointers, size_t, string literals, casts, malloc, arithmetic, array indexing, control flow). There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, Microsoft-specific keywords, or GCC/Clang builtins elsewhere in the code. The string literal concatenation, bitwise shifts, and casts are standard C behavior (though they may have implementation-defined semantics for signedness/overflow \u2014 not language extensions). Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2."
