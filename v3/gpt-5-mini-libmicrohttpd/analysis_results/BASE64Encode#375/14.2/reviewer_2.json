First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of BASE64Encode.\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nBASE64Encode (const void *in, size_t len, char **output)\n{\n#define FILLCHAR '='\n  const char *cvt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n                    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n                    \"0123456789+/\";\n  const char *data = in;\n  char *opt;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t i;\n  char c;\n  ret = 0;\n\n  opt = malloc (2 + (len * 4 / 3) + 8);\n  if (NULL == opt)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    c = (data[i] >> 2) & 0x3F;\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    c = (data[i] << 4) & 0x3F;\n    if (++i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F));\n    }\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] << 2) & 0x3F));\n      if (++i < len)\n      {\n        c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 6) & 0x03));\n      }\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      ++i;\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = data[i] & 0x3F;\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n  }\n  *output = opt;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe loop header 'for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)' sets the loop counter and the conditions themselves are acceptable, but the loop body also modifies the loop counter 'i' (several occurrences of '++i' and '++i' and an explicit '++i' in the else branch). This violates Rule 14.2 clause that the loop counter shall not be modified in the for loop body (and effectively produces multiple modifications of the counter per iteration).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for header declares and initializes the loop counter i (for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)), but the loop body also increments i in multiple places (several ++i occurrences and an explicit ++i in the else branch). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires that the loop counter shall not be modified in the body of the for loop (the third clause must be the only place that modifies the loop counter). Modifying i inside the body therefore makes this for loop ill\u2011formed under Rule 14.2. To fix this, restructure the code so the loop counter is only modified by the for third clause (for example use an inner variable for additional advancing, or rewrite the loop as a while loop that explicitly controls the index), or use a separate index variable for inner advances."
