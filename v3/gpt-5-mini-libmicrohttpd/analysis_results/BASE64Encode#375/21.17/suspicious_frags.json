  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns the standard string handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn. The function BASE64Encode does not call any of these functions (or any other functions from <string.h>), so there are no code fragments that are relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate.\n\nNote: While there are places in the code where pointer/index arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation occur (e.g. malloc sizing and multiple ++i increments within the loop) that could warrant a bounds-safety review, those issues are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 because they do not involve the standard string functions listed by the rule. Therefore they are not reported here for Rule 21.17 compliance checking."
