  "explanation": "I inspected the function body for any direct or indirect calls that could lead to recursion. The only explicit function call in this routine is the allocation call shown above. There are no calls to BASE64Encode itself, no other function calls, and no use of function pointers, callbacks, or table-driven dispatch that could introduce indirect recursion. Array indexing, casts, arithmetic and increment operators present in the code are not function calls. Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 17.2 compliance."
