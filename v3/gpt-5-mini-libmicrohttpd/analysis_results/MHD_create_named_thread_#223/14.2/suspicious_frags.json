  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided source for any for-statements or fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (requirements about the three clauses and loop counter usage). There are no for loops in the supplied code text \u2014 no occurrences of the keyword \"for\" nor any loop constructs that match the for-statement grammar. All control flow in the snippet uses if/else and preprocessor conditionals; no loop counters or loop clauses are present to evaluate against Rule 14.2. therefore there are no code fragments in the given code that need to be investigated for Rule 14.2. (Note: macros or external functions referenced here could expand/include for loops, but such expansions are not present in the provided code and thus are outside the scope of this inspection.)"
