Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__select:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__select (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.epoll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-e' or '--epoll'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.poll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-p' or '--poll'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.select = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not a violation: the expression returns one of two distinct enum values depending on param_name[1]. That selection affects program behaviour (which enum the caller receives), so the code is not dead. (A violation would occur only if it were provable that param_name[1] always has the same value\u2014e.g. callers always pass a long option \"--...\" so one branch is never executed\u2014making the other branch effectively dead.)"
