  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the conditional expression '-' == param_name[1] depends on the runtime value of param_name[1] and is not an invariant. It would only violate Rule 14.3 if the expression were provably constant at compile time, which is not the case here. (Unrelated: dereferencing param_name[1] may be undefined if param_name is NULL or too short.)"
