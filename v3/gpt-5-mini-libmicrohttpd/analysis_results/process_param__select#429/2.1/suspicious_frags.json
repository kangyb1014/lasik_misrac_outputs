  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- The two early return statements inside the if (tool_params.epoll) and if (tool_params.poll) blocks are conditional and reachable when those conditions are true; they are not dead code. \n- The assignment tool_params.select = ! 0; is executed whenever neither of the above conditions hold, so it is reachable. The expression !0 is a constant expression evaluating to 1, but that does not make the statement unreachable.\n- The final return uses a ternary expression based on the runtime value of param_name[1]; both outcomes of the ternary are reachable for different input strings, so neither arm is statically unreachable.\n- There are no statements following unconditional returns nor any syntactic constructs (e.g., return followed by code in the same block) that would create unreachable code.\n\nNote: Other potential issues (for example, lack of a null check for param_name or bounds checks before accessing param_name[1]) are not matters of unreachable code and therefore were not flagged under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
