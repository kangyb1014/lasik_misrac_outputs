  "scenario": "No \u2014 the if-return is a runtime guard and not dead code in itself. Removing it would change behaviour (logging would occur when the option bit is clear). It only becomes a Rule 2.2 violation in a specific project context; for example, if MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG is always set and the call daemon->custom_error_log(...) is a pure no-op with no observable side effects, then that logging call would be executed but removable without affecting program behaviour (dead code). Note also that if the condition is a compile-time constant making the call never reachable, that is unreachable code (not \"dead code\" per MISRA note 2)."
