  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_DLOG:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_DLOG (const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n          const char *format,\n          ...)\n{\n  va_list va;\n\n  if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG))\n    return;\n  va_start (va, format);\n  daemon->custom_error_log (daemon->custom_error_log_cls,\n                            format,\n                            va);\n  va_end (va);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  va_start (va, format);\n  daemon->custom_error_log (daemon->custom_error_log_cls,\n                            format,\n                            va);\n  va_end (va);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The va_start/va_end pair and the call to daemon->custom_error_log are executed when error logging is enabled; removing them would remove the logging side effect (and possibly change timing/observable behaviour). Therefore these operations are not dead code. (Caveat: if custom_error_log were guaranteed to be a no-op by other means \u2014 e.g. compiled away or replaced by an empty function \u2014 then calls could be effectively dead, but nothing in the fragment indicates that.)"
