Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not need investigation for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the function signature and closing brace are syntactic; the local declaration \"va_list va;\" is required for the subsequent variadic handling and so is not dead code; there are no other statements or blocks in this function that are executed yet removable without changing behaviour. Unreachable code (code that can never be executed) is not considered dead code by the rule, and there are no obvious unreachable blocks here apart from the conditional flow already flagged. Therefore only the conditional guard and the variadic-call block are reported for further inspection."
