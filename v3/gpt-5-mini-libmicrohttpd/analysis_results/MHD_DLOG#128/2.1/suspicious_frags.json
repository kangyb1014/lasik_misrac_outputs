  "suspicious_frags": [
    "  if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG))\n    return;",

  "explanation": "Only the fragments above can be (statically) unreachable depending on build-time configuration: if the macro MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG is defined as 0, the if-condition becomes always true and the return will always execute, making the subsequent va_start/va_end and call to daemon->custom_error_log unreachable. No other lines in the function constitute statically unreachable code: the function signature and the local declaration (va_list va;) are always present but not unreachable; the conditional return itself is meaningful; and the call to daemon->custom_error_log is reachable in the general case when the options bit is set at runtime. Other potential runtime issues (e.g., daemon being NULL or custom_error_log being NULL, or custom_error_log performing non-returning actions) are undefined behaviour or dynamic control-flow concerns, not statically unreachable code per MISRA Rule 2.1, so they do not warrant inclusion as unreachable-code fragments."
