  "explanation": "The only potential for indirect recursion in this function is the call via the function pointer daemon->custom_error_log; that pointer could (externally) be set to MHD_DLOG or to another function that eventually calls MHD_DLOG. There are no direct calls to MHD_DLOG elsewhere in this fragment. The va_start/va_end macros and the options check (if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG)) return;) do not introduce recursion and so do not require investigation for Rule 17.2. No other function calls or function-pointer invocations appear in this code, so no other fragments are relevant to potential self-calls."
