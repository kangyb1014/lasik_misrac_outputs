  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the general case. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert calls in this function compare compile-time constants (macros). When those macros are equal the boolean test is a tautology and has no side effects; the runtime evaluation of that expression therefore does not affect program behaviour and can be removed without changing behaviour \u2014 i.e. it is dead code and would contravene Rule 2.2.\n\nCaveats: this conclusion depends on how mhd_assert is defined and on whether the compared macros can differ on any supported configuration. If mhd_assert introduces observable side effects even when the test is true (e.g. logging), or if the check is meant to catch mismatches that can occur on some build/configuration so the expression is not actually a tautology across the project, then the code would not be dead. Also, if the intention is a compile-time check (e.g. using a static assert mechanism), that should be used instead to avoid a runtime no-op. But given the usual runtime-assert semantics and equal compile-time constants, Agent A\u2019s report is correct."
