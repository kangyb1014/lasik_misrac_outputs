  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3 because they are not constant controlling expressions: the condition that calls a function (if (! MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (connection))) depends on runtime behaviour; the rest are statements (shutdown calls, assignments to connection->state and connection->event_loop_info) or preprocessor conditionals which are not C controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. The two reported bitmask tests should be investigated because they are controlling expressions that could be invariant depending on how the option macros or daemon->options are defined/configured (and because conditional compilation (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT) changes how these tests affect control flow)."
