  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The 'else' is inside the #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT block and pairs with the inner 'if (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))'. When HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined the 'else' takes effect and control falls through to the shutdown() after the #endif (the comment explains this). When HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined the entire #ifdef block (including the 'else') is removed by the preprocessor and the standalone shutdown() remains. Therefore no code in this fragment is inherently unreachable."
