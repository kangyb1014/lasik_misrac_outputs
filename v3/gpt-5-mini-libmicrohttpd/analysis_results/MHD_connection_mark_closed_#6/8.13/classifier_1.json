  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the function writes to members of *connection (e.g. connection->state and connection->event_loop_info) and performs operations using connection->socket_fd, so the pointer must not be const-qualified. Adding const would prevent the required modifications."
