  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the local pointer is declared as pointing to a const-qualified type and is used only for read access (daemon->options is read). Assigning a non-const pointer to a const-qualified pointer is allowed. A violation would occur if the pointer were declared without const while only read access is needed, or if code used this pointer to modify the pointed object (e.g. daemon->options = ...), which would conflict with the const qualification requirement."
