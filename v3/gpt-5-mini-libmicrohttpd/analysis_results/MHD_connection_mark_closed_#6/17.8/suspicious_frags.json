  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameter 'connection' itself. Rule 17.8 prohibits changing the parameter (the pointer value), but allows modifying the object it points to. In this function there is no assignment to 'connection' (no 'connection = ...' or pointer arithmetic on it). The statements that write connection->state and connection->event_loop_info modify the object referred to by the pointer, which is permitted. The local variable 'daemon' is a separate pointer initialized from connection->daemon (not a function parameter) and its use does not violate the rule. Calls that pass 'connection' to other functions (e.g. MHD_tls_connection_shutdown) do not modify the parameter variable within this function. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
