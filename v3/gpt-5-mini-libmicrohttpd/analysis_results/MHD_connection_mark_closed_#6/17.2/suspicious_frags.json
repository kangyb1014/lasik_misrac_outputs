  "explanation": "Only function-call expressions within MHD_connection_mark_closed_ can create direct or indirect recursion, so the code fragments selected are the only places where this function could call back (via other functions). The remaining lines are not calls and therefore cannot cause recursion: they are the function header and local variable declaration, bitmask option checks (e.g. daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO / MHD_USE_TLS), preprocessor conditional (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT), and simple assignments to connection->state and connection->event_loop_info. Those constructs do not invoke other functions and thus do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
