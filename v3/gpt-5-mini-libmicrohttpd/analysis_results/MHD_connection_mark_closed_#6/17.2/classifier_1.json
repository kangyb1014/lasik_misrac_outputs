  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: MHD_connection_mark_closed_ calls a different function, MHD_tls_connection_shutdown(), not itself. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect self-calls; there is no evidence here of direct recursion. An indirect recursion would only occur if MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (or another callee) calls back into MHD_connection_mark_closed_ (or otherwise creates a call cycle). Based on the provided code fragment alone, no such cycle is shown\u2014so the rule is not violated. To be certain, inspect the implementation/call graph of MHD_tls_connection_shutdown for any calls back to MHD_connection_mark_closed_."
