  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code fragment. The code performs bitwise checks on daemon->options, conditional compilation on HTTPS_SUPPORT, a call to MHD_tls_connection_shutdown, calls to shutdown, and assignments to connection->state and connection->event_loop_info. None of these involve string comparisons or use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
