  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_mark_closed_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_connection_mark_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n\n  if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO))\n  {\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n    /* For TLS connection use shutdown of TLS layer\n     * and do not shutdown TCP socket.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code does not contain dead code: the #ifdef block conditionally selects between calling the TLS shutdown helper (and, only on failure, shutdown()) or falling through to the subsequent shutdown() after the #endif. The lone else is intentionally paired with the shutdown() that follows the #endif, so every executed operation affects program behaviour depending on HTTPS_SUPPORT and daemon->options; removing any of those calls would change behaviour."
