Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of make_blocking:\n```c\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment tests for the O_NONBLOCK bit and clears it when set: if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags) detects that O_NONBLOCK is present and then calls fcntl(..., flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) to remove it. Removing that call would change socket behaviour (non\u2011blocking vs blocking) and therefore would affect program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (Only in the pathological case that O_NONBLOCK is defined as 0 would the condition always be false and the operation be a no\u2011op, but that would be a misconfiguration rather than typical code behaviour.)"
