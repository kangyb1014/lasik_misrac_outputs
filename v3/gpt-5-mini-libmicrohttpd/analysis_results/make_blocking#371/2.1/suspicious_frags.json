  "explanation": "The only constructs in this function that can be conditionally excluded from a translation unit (and therefore potentially be unreachable in a given build) are the platform-specific conditional-compilation blocks (#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS) / #elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS) / #endif). Each branch is mutually exclusive for a single build configuration, so the branch not selected by the preprocessor will not be present in the compiled translation unit and should be reviewed for possible unreachable-code concerns. Other parts of the function do not present unreachable-code issues: the function header and closing brace are syntactically required; the local declarations and the subsequent calls (fcntl, ioctlsocket) are used within their respective branches; there are no statements following a terminating call (e.g. no code after abort() in the same flow) that would be unconditionally unreachable; and there are no return statements or control-flow constructs in this snippet that produce unreachable statements. Therefore only the conditional compilation blocks need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 compliance."
