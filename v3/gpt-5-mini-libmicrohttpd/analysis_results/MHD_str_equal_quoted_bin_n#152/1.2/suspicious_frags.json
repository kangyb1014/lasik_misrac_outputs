  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in this function. The code only uses standard C constructs: the bool type (standard since C99 via <stdbool.h>), size_t (standard), pointer and array indexing, standard control flow (if, for), the comma in the for-loop increment (standard C), and ordinary character/escape constants. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens (for example no __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords/pragmas) and no other documented compiler extensions are present. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
