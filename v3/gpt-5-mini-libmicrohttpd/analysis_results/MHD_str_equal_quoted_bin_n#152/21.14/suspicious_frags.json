  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other string-comparison standard library function such as strcmp/strncmp/etc.) is present in the provided function. I inspected the entire function body: it performs manual, character-by-character comparisons (quoted[i] != unquoted[j]), handles backslash-escaping by advancing the index, and performs explicit length checks (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2 and the final (quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j)). There are no function calls or macros that could be memcmp wrappers in this snippet, so there is nothing here that falls under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp were used it would appear as a direct call (or via a visible wrapper), which is not the case in this code. Therefore no fragments need investigation for this rule."
