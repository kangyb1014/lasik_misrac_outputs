  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment does not call any <string.h> functions. The loop condition (i < quoted_len && j < unquoted_len) ensures quoted[i] and unquoted[j] are initially in-bounds, and the code explicitly increments i on a backslash and immediately checks (quoted_len == i) before accessing quoted[i], preventing out-of-bounds access."
