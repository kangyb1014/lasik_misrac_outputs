  "explanation": "Other fragments (variable declarations: \"size_t i; size_t j;\", initialization \"j = 0;\", the loop body braces and final \"return true;\") are straightforward control/data constructs and do not by themselves create unreachable code. The selected fragments are places where control flow, index arithmetic, and loop termination interact (initial pruning check, loop condition with two indices, manual increment of i inside the loop, the character access/compare, and the post-loop length check). These are the locations that can create subtle cases where a branch may never be taken or an access/return makes later code unreachable; therefore they should be investigated. No other lines introduce additional control-flow constructs that could generate unreachable code beyond normal returns already listed above."
