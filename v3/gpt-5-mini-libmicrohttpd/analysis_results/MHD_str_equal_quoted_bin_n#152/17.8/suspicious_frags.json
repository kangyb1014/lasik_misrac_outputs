  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters (quoted, unquoted) are only used for read-only indexing (quoted[i], unquoted[j]); there are no assignments to the pointer variables (no quoted = ..., no quoted += ..., no unquoted = ...). The pointers are declared const, preventing modification of the pointed-to objects.\n- The length parameters (quoted_len, unquoted_len) are only read and compared; there are no assignments to these parameters.\n- Only local variables i and j are incremented (including an extra i++ inside the loop body). Modifying these local index variables does not violate Rule 17.8 because they are not function parameters.\n- No pointer arithmetic that assigns back to a parameter occurs.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
