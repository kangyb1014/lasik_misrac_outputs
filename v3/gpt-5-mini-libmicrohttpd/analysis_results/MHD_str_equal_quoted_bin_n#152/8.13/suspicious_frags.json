  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Both pointer parameters are declared as const char * (quoted and unquoted), satisfying MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer objects (no local pointer variables, no non-const pointer parameters, no pointer returns, and no casts to/from pointer types) in the function body that would require investigation for missing const qualification. Array indexing into the const char * parameters (quoted[i], unquoted[j]) does not violate the rule."
