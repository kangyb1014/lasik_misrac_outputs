  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp in the provided function. The only standard-library calls are memcpy, which copies bytes (not comparing null-terminated strings), and there are no string-handling functions (strcpy, strcmp, memcmp, etc.) present. The code treats data as binary buffers with explicit lengths (length, SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE) and uses pointer arithmetic and sha256_transform on raw blocks \u2014 not null-terminated string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
