  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect self-calls. This function body contains no direct call to MHD_SHA256_update itself, so there is no obvious direct recursion. The only points that can introduce indirect recursion are calls to other functions \u2014 these are the fragments selected above and should be investigated to ensure they do not call back (directly or indirectly) into MHD_SHA256_update. Other code in the function (variable declarations, arithmetic on ctx->count, pointer increments like data += bytes_left/data += SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE, conditionals, loops, and return) do not invoke other functions and therefore cannot create indirect recursion, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
