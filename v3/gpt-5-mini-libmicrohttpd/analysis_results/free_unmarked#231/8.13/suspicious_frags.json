  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be made to point to const-qualified types. The suspicious fragments above cover every place in this function where pointer-typed struct members or the function parameter are referenced/modified and thus warrant investigation: the function signature (pp) and each member access/free/assignment sequence (content_name, content_type, content_filename, content_transfer_encoding). Other tokens and expressions in the function \u2014 the NULL comparisons, the bitmask checks (pp->have & NE_...), the free() calls and assignments to NULL, the if/brace control structure \u2014 are not separate pointer-type declarations that could be made const; moreover, because the code explicitly frees and assigns these members, they necessarily must be modifiable (non-const) here. Therefore no additional fragments in this function require investigation for Rule 8.13."
