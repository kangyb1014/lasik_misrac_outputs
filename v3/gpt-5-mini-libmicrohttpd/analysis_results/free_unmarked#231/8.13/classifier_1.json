  "scenario": "If the struct member pp->content_transfer_encoding is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *content_transfer_encoding) but the object it points to is only read (not modified) throughout the program, then the pointer should be const-qualified (e.g. const char *). In that situation Rule 8.13 is violated because the pointer could and should point to a const-qualified type."
