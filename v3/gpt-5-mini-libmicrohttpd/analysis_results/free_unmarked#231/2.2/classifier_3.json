  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of free_unmarked:\n```c\nstatic void\nfree_unmarked (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp)\n{\n  if ( (NULL != pp->content_name) &&\n       (0 == (pp->have & NE_content_name)) )\n  {\n    free (pp->content_name);\n    pp->content_name = NULL;\n  }\n  if ( (NULL != pp->content_type) &&\n       (0 == (pp->have & NE_content_type)) )\n  {\n    free (pp->content_type);\n    pp->content_type = NULL;\n  }\n  if ( (NULL != pp->content_filename) &&\n       (0 == (pp->have & NE_content_filename)) )\n  {\n    free (pp->content_filename);\n    pp->content_filename = NULL;\n  }\n  if ( (NULL != pp->content_transfer_encoding) &&\n       (0 == (pp->have & NE_content_transfer_encoding)) )\n  {\n    free (pp->content_transfer_encoding);\n    pp->content_transfer_encoding = NULL;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (NULL != pp->content_name) &&\n       (0 == (pp->have & NE_content_name)) )\n  {\n    free (pp->content_name);\n    pp->content_name = NULL;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The free(pp->content_name) and pp->content_name = NULL operations are only executed when pp->content_name != NULL and the NE_content_name flag is not set; removing them would change program behaviour (memory would remain allocated and pointer not cleared), so they are not dead code. (If, in the whole project, the condition can be shown to be never true, the block would be unreachable \u2014 note 2 \u2014 which is not classified as dead code by the Rule.)"
