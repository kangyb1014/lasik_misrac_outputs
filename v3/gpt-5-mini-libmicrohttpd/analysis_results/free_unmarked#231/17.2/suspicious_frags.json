  "explanation": "The only function calls in this fragment are the four calls to free(...). There are no direct calls to free_unmarked anywhere in the provided code, no other function calls, and no dereferenced function pointers invoked that could indicate indirect recursion. The conditional checks and assignments are local and do not introduce calls. Therefore only the free(...) calls warrant investigation for potential indirect recursion (for example if free were unexpectedly macro-redefined or routed through a wrapper that called back into free_unmarked). All other lines (function signature, conditionals, NULL checks and assignments to NULL) do not present recursion concerns and need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
