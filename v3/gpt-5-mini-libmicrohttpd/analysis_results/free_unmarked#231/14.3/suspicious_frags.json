  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (loop/if conditions) that may be invariant. The only controlling expressions in this function are the four if conditions above; those are reported for investigation. Other lines (function header, free() calls, assignments like pp->content_name = NULL, and the surrounding braces) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and do not need to be investigated for this rule."
