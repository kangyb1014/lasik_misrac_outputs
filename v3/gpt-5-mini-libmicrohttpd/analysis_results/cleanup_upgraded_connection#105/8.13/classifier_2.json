  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement connection->urh = NULL; simply stores a null pointer and does not by itself violate Rule 8.13 (which concerns whether the pointed-to type should be const-qualified). From the provided fragment we cannot determine that the pointee must be const: the code also calls free(urh) and the object may be modified elsewhere, so using a non-const pointer can be justified. If the pointee were truly immutable everywhere, then the declaration could be changed to a pointer-to-const, but that cannot be concluded from this fragment alone."
