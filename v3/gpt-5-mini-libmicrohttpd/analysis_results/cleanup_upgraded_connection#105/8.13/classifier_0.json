  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The expression accesses connection->daemon->options (an integer flags field) but does not introduce a pointer that could/should be const here. The function later modifies connection (connection->urh = NULL and frees urh), so making the connection pointer or its pointee const would be inappropriate. If a pointer were only used for read access, it should be const-qualified, but that is not the case in this routine."
