  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any code that attempts to compare null-terminated strings via memcmp. The fragment only performs pointer/null checks (if (NULL == urh)), integer/bitmask checks (options & MHD_USE_TLS), socket value comparisons (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != ...), and calls external functions (gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free). None of these are memcmp calls or string comparisons of null-terminated strings. Any memcmp usage would have to appear explicitly in this code fragment (or in macros expanded here), and no such occurrences are present, so there are no suspicious fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
