Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_upgraded_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = connection->urh;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return;\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  /* Signal remote client the end of TLS connection by\n   * gracefully closing TLS session. */\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to gnutls_bye performs an observable TLS shutdown (network/timing side effects) when the MHD_USE_TLS bit is set, so removing it would change program behaviour. The statement is conditional and only executed when TLS is in use, so it is not dead code. (It would only be a Rule 2.2 violation in a pathological build where the call is actually executed but guaranteed to have no effect \u2014 e.g. gnutls_bye is a no-op/stub \u2014 in which case the executed operation could be removed without changing behaviour.)"
