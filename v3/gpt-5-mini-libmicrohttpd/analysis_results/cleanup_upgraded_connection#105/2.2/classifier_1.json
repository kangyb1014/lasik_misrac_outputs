  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_upgraded_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = connection->urh;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return;\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  /* Signal remote client the end of TLS connection by\n   * gracefully closing TLS session. */\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The conditional call closes the app socket when it is valid; removing it would change program behaviour (a socket would remain open). This is therefore not dead code. (Hypothetical violation: if program invariants guaranteed urh->app.socket is always MHD_INVALID_SOCKET so the call is never executed, that code would be unreachable \u2014 note MISRA 2.2 distinguishes unreachable code from dead code \u2014 or if the close call is provably redundant because the socket is always already closed and removal has no effect, then it would constitute dead code.)"
