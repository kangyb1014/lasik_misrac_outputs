  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function cleanup_upgraded_connection does not call itself directly or indirectly in the shown code. The call free(urh) simply deallocates memory and, in standard C, does not invoke user functions that would call cleanup_upgraded_connection. An indirect recursion would only occur if one of the library calls used here (e.g. gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_, or the free implementation) invoked cleanup_upgraded_connection back again \u2014 there is no evidence of such callbacks in the provided code."
