  "explanation": "The function parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection'. The code does not reassign or modify the parameter variable 'connection' itself anywhere (no statement like 'connection = ...'). The local pointer 'urh' is assigned from connection->urh, and operations modify the object pointed to by 'connection' (e.g., connection->urh = NULL) which is permitted by Rule 17.8. Calls to gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free(urh) and the conditional checks only operate on members or on the memory pointed to, and do not modify the pointer parameter variable. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or need investigation for Rule 17.8."
