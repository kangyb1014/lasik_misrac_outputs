  "scenario": "Not violated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because that rule specifically restricts use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). The fragment while (0 != str[r]) does not call any <string.h> function, so it does not by itself violate 21.17. Note, however, that the loop can still read out of bounds if the caller supplies a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffer (e.g. char buf[3] = {'A','B','C'}; calling the function with buf will cause access to str[3] which is out of bounds). This runtime/undefined\u2011behavior concern is not a direct breach of Rule 21.17 but is a correctness/safety issue that must be addressed (ensure str is NUL\u2011terminated or bounds-checked)."
