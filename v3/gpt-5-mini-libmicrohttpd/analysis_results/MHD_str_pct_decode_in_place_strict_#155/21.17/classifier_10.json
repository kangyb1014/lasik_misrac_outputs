  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment does not call any <string.h> functions. The read of chr is guarded by while (0 != str[r]) so accessing str[r++] for the '%' character is within bounds; subsequent reads of d1 and d2 may read the terminating NUL (which is inside the object) and are checked for 0 before further processing. Therefore this code does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: if str is not NUL-terminated at all that would be undefined behavior, but that is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 which concerns use of <string.h> functions.)"
