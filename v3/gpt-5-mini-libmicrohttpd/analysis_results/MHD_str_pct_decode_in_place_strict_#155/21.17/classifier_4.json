  "scenario": "Not violated. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies to the use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memset, strcpy, etc.). The fragment str[w++] = chr; does not call any <string.h> function. Moreover, within the decoding loop the invariant w <= r holds (each iteration increments r at least as much as w), so writes to str[w++] and the final str[w] = 0 occur at or before the original null terminator and do not extend past the original string contents. The only ways an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access could occur here are if the input pointer str is invalid or the input is not properly null\u2011terminated (which would already be undefined behavior on the reads) \u2014 these are not violations of Rule 21.17."
