  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any other Standard Library string comparison functions (e.g. strcmp, strncmp) appears in the provided code. The function performs character-by-character processing using direct indexing (str[r], str[w]) and explicit checks for the NUL terminator (0), so there is no place where memcmp could be comparing a null-terminated string. The only external calls visible are toxdigitvalue and (in the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE branch) MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_, neither of which are shown here; those functions would need to be reviewed separately if present in the codebase, but they are not part of the supplied fragment. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
