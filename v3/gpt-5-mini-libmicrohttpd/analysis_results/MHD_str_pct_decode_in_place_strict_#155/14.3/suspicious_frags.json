  "explanation": "I examined all controlling expressions in the function and found none that are invariant (constant) at runtime, so there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\nChecked controlling constructs and reasons they are not invariant:\n- while (0 != str[r]) \u2014 str[r] is read from the input string and r is incremented inside the loop (r++), so the controlling expression depends on runtime data and changes as the loop progresses.\n- if ('%' == chr) \u2014 chr is obtained from str[r++] immediately before the test, so the condition depends on runtime data and is not constant.\n- if (0 == d1) and if (0 == d2) \u2014 d1 and d2 are read from str[r++] at runtime; their values depend on the string contents and are not constant.\n- if ((0 > h) || (0 > l)) \u2014 h and l are computed at runtime via toxdigitvalue(), so this is not an invariant.\n- The preprocessor branch (#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) contains only a call and a test if (broken) where broken is an output of that call; it is not a compile-time constant.\n\nAlso, there are no do-while loops or intentionally infinite constant loops in this code that would fall under the allowed exceptions.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments need to be flagged for investigation under Rule 14.3."
