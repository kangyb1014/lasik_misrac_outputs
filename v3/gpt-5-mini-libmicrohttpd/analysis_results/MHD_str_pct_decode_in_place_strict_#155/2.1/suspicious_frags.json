  "explanation": "The primary potential sources of unreachable code are the mutually exclusive conditional-compilation branches controlled by MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE (only one branch will be compiled into a given build) and the nested early returns inside the percent-decoding logic which create multiple return paths. These fragments are provided so they can be inspected in the actual build configuration to ensure no code that remains in the compiled project is actually unreachable.\n\nAll other statements in the function are standard control flow: the while loop is guarded by the string-terminator check (while (0 != str[r])) before reading str[r++], the checks for missing percent-encoded digits (d1/d2 == 0) return an error immediately, and the hex-digit validation returns on invalid digits. Those constructs do not by themselves produce unreachable statements in the compiled code and therefore do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1."
