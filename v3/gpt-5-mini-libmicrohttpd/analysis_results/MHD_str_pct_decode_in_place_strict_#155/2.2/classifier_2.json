Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ (char *str)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  size_t res;\n  bool broken;\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (str, &broken);\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    res = 0;\n    str[0] = 0;\n  }\n  return res;\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The check is reached when a percent-escape is truncated at the end of the string. For example, str == \"%A\\0\" leads to d1='A', d2==0 and the function returns 0. Removing this check would change behavior for such inputs, so the statement is not dead code."
