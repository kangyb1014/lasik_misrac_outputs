  "explanation": "I did not select other pointer-using fragments because they appear to modify the pointed-to objects or are passed to APIs that plausibly require non-const pointers, so making them point to const would likely be incorrect:\n\n- The function parameter \"struct MHD_Connection *connection\" is written to (connection->rp.resp_iov.*, connection->state, calls that change connection state), so the connection object is mutated and cannot be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- The local \"response = connection->rp.response;\" pointer is used to modify response fields (response->total_size, response->data_start, response->data_size), so response must be mutable and cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- Assigning alloc'd memory into connection->rp.resp_iov.iov (connection->rp.resp_iov.iov = MHD_connection_alloc_memory_(...)) and later updating resp_iov.cnt/sent are mutations; those pointers/fields cannot be const.\n\n- Calls that pass &response->mutex or connection to functions/macros that lock/unlock or close the connection (MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, MHD_connection_close_, CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR, etc.) necessarily operate on mutable objects; pointers passed there must not be const.\n\n- Checking or assigning scalar fields (response->data_iovcnt, response->total_size comparisons, NULL checks) are not indicators that the underlying pointer types should be made const beyond the two cases flagged above.\n\nI flagged the memcpy from response->data_iov and the explicit cast (char *) response->data into the crc call because both indicate read-only use of data buffers or an explicit removal of const-qualification; these are the likely spots where Rule 8.13 (use const-qualified types whenever possible) may be violated and need investigation. No other pointer usages in the function appear to be eligible for a const qualifier without changing semantics."
