  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that (a) are assignments or control paths that may be executed but could be no-ops in some builds or configurations, (b) use special marker-pointer logic that can be fragile (pointer-equality with string marker, ITC marker handling), or (c) perform list/timeout processing and removal operations that might be redundant or never exercised depending on runtime state. These deserve manual inspection to determine whether they are actually live code with observable side effects or removable dead code.\n\nI have NOT included the following kinds of code for investigation because they are unlikely to be dead code:\n- The main epoll_wait loop and the per-event processing core (epoll_wait call, the for-loop iterating events, and the branches that update pos->epoll_state and insert into eready lists). These perform system calls and mutate connection state \u2014 they have clear observable effects and cannot be removed safely.\n- The code that adds/removes the listen FD to/from the epoll set (epoll_ctl with daemon->listen_fd) when the daemon conditions change. These calls have explicit side effects on kernel state and are necessary for correct socket handling.\n- The accept loop (MHD_accept_connection) and the logic that limits accepts to a small series length. Accepting sockets alters visible program behavior and interacts with external systems \u2014 not dead.\n- The suspend/resume and timeout functions invocations (resume_suspended_connections(), get_timeout_millisec_int(), MHD_connection_handle_idle(), run_epoll_for_upgrade(), call_handlers()). These call into other components and may have side effects beyond this function.\n- The variable declarations and ordinary local temporaries that are clearly used by subsequent code (events[], event, ls, num_events, i, timeout_ms, pos, prev, need_to_accept) \u2014 their uses are visible throughout the function.\n\nThe selected fragments are those that look like they might be redundant, conditional-only, marker-based, or that set state which may never be observed \u2014 thus they should be inspected further to determine whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
