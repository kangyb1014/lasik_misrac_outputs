  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls the WinSock API function WSACleanup(), not MHD_fini. There is no direct self-call and no reasonable indication of an indirect call back to MHD_fini, so no recursion is introduced. (Only if WSACleanup were somehow implemented to call MHD_fini would Rule 17.2 be violated.)"
