  "explanation": "The function MHD_fini does not call itself directly (no occurrence of \"MHD_fini(\" inside the function). The only elements that could lead to indirect recursion are the function calls inside the body, so those calls are reported for investigation. Other code fragments in the snippet \u2014 the function signature/return type, the enclosing braces, the preprocessor conditional lines (#ifdef / #endif / #if defined(...)), and comments \u2014 cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion and therefore do not require investigation for Rule 17.2."
