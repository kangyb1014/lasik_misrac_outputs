Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected the three executable cleanup calls because Rule 2.2 concerns operations that are executed but could be removed without changing behaviour. These are the only statements in the function that perform runtime actions and therefore are the primary candidates for being dead code. The other parts of the snippet should not be investigated for dead-code under this rule: the preprocessor directives (#ifdef / #if / #endif) are compile-time conditionals (not executed code), the function signature and braces are structural (not executable statements), and comments/whitespace are non-executable. There is no unreachable-code pattern in the fragment shown (no return statements or conditional branches that make later statements unreachable). Therefore only the shown calls are plausible suspects for dead-code and warrant investigation."
