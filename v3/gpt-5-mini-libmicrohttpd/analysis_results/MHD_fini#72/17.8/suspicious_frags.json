  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function MHD_fini is declared as void MHD_fini(void) and therefore has no parameters to modify. All statements inside are calls to other functions (gnutls_global_deinit(), WSACleanup(), MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish()) with no arguments and there are no assignments or modifications of parameters or local pointer parameters in this function. Preprocessor conditionals only select which calls run and do not introduce parameter modification. If desired, separate review of the implementations of the called functions could be done, but within MHD_fini itself no MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 issues exist."
