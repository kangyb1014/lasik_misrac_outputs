  "scenario": "No violation. The WSACleanup() call is inside a preprocessor conditional (#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)). If the macro is not defined the statement is not present in the translated source; if it is defined the call is reachable at runtime. This is conditional compilation, not unreachable code (Rule 2.1 concerns code that is present in the program but cannot be executed)."
