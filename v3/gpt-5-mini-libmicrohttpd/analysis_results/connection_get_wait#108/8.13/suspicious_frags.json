  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function is the parameter 'c'. The function only reads members of *c (no modifications), so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should likely point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *c'). No other pointer variables appear in the code fragment. Local variables are plain uint64_t (not pointers) or already const-qualified scalars; therefore they do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
