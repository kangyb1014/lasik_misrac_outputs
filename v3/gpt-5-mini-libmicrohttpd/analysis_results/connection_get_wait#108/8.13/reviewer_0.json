  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The function takes a pointer 'struct MHD_Connection *c' but only reads members (c->last_activity, c->connection_timeout_ms) and never modifies the pointee. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so the parameter should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *c' unless there is a specific justified reason not to (for example, the function must match an existing non-const function-pointer prototype, or it relies on modifying the object indirectly via other means). In the code shown no such justification appears, so the report that this is a violation of Rule 8.13 is correct."
