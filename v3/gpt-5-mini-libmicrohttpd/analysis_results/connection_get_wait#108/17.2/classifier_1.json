  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a comment referencing connection_check_timedout() and does not perform any function calls. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if there were actual recursive calls (e.g. connection_get_wait() calls connection_check_timedout() and that function calls connection_get_wait(), creating indirect recursion), which is not shown by this comment."
