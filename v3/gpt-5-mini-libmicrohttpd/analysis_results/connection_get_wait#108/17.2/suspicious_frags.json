  "explanation": "Only the three fragments above can possibly introduce calls that might (directly or indirectly) call connection_get_wait: the call to MHD_monotonic_msec_counter(), the call to mhd_assert(), and the referenced function name connection_check_timedout() in the comment (included because it indicates a related function that should be checked for mutual calls). The remainder of the function is pure arithmetic, comparisons and return statements operating on local variables and struct fields \u2014 none of which are function calls or invoke function pointers \u2014 so they cannot create direct or indirect recursion. There are no other function-call expressions, no calls through function pointers, and no macros in the shown code that could hide additional calls, therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 based on the provided code."
