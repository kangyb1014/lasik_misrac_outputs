  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains operations that are evidently live and affect control flow or results and therefore do not appear to be dead code: - now, since_actv, timeout are used in conditionals; - the outer if/else-if branches lead to distinct return values and therefore affect behavior; - the equality branch (since_actv == timeout) returns 100 intentionally to avoid busy-waiting; - mseconds_left is computed and returned in the normal (non-timeout) case. Unreachable code (never executed) is not the same as dead code per the rule notes; I did not mark any fragment that is plainly unreachable from the visible snippet (e.g. code after returns). The listed fragments are those whose execution or removal may be redundant or rely on assumptions (assert macro behavior, unusually large since_actv handling and the jump_back logic) and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead-code violations."
