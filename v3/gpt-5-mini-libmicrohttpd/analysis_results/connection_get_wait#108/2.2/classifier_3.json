Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_get_wait:\n```c\nstatic uint64_t\nconnection_get_wait (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const uint64_t now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const uint64_t since_actv = now - c->last_activity;\n  const uint64_t timeout = c->connection_timeout_ms;\n  uint64_t mseconds_left;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != timeout);\n  /* Keep the next lines in sync with #connection_check_timedout() to avoid\n   * undesired side-effects like busy-waiting. */\n  if (timeout < since_actv)\n  {\n    if (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      { /* Jump back is less than 5 seconds, try to recover. */\n        return 100; /* Set wait time to 0.1 seconds */\n      }\n      /* Too large jump back */\n    }\n    return 0; /* Connection has timed out */\n  }\n  else if (since_actv == timeout)\n  {\n    /* Exact match for timeout and time from last activity.\n     * Maybe this is just a precise match or this happens because the timer\n     * resolution is too low.\n     * Set wait time to 0.1 seconds to avoid busy-waiting with low\n     * timer resolution as connection is not timed-out yet. */\n    return 100;\n  }\n  mseconds_left = timeout - since_actv;\n\n  return mseconds_left;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (5000 >= jump_back)\n      { /* Jump back is less than 5 seconds, try to recover. */\n        return 100; /* Set wait time to 0.1 seconds */\n      }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Example: assume c->last_activity = T and now = T - 2000 (ms) because the clock jumped back 2000 ms. since_actv = now - c->last_activity (unsigned) becomes a very large value > UINT64_MAX/2, so the test UINT64_MAX/2 < since_actv is true. Then jump_back = c->last_activity - now equals 2000, so the condition (5000 >= jump_back) is true and the fragment returns 100 (0.1 s). If this fragment were removed, the code would fall through and return 0 (connection timed out) instead \u2014 a different observable behaviour. Therefore the fragment is reachable and its removal would affect program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
