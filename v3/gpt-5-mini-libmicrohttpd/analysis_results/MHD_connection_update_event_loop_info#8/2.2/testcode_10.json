  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThis fragment becomes dead code in builds where the assertion macro is a no-op (e.g. mhd_assert(0) expands to nothing in release builds) or when the MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE state cannot occur: the case body then performs no observable action (only an assertion and a break). In that configuration the operation(s) executed by this case can be removed without changing program behaviour, which constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/82.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_connection_update_event_loop_info (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  /* Do not update states of suspended connection */\n  if (connection->suspended)\n    return; /* States will be updated after resume. */\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS != connection->tls_state)\n  {   /* HTTPS connection. */\n    switch (connection->tls_state)\n    {\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT:\n      connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ;\n      return;\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_HANDSHAKING:\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_WR_CLOSING:\n      if (0 == gnutls_record_get_direction (connection->tls_session))\n        connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ;\n      else\n        connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_WRITE;\n      return;\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_CONNECTED:\n      break; /* Do normal processing */\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_WR_CLOSED:\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_TLS_FAILED:\n      connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP;\n      return;\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_TLS_CLOSING:  /* Not implemented yet */\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_TLS_CLOSED:   /* Not implemented yet */\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_INVALID_STATE:\n    case MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS: /* Not possible */\n    default:\n      MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Invalid TLS state value.\\n\"));\n    }\n  }\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  while (1)\n  {\n#if DEBUG_STATES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"In function %s handling connection at state: %s\\n\"),\n              MHD_FUNC_,\n              MHD_state_to_string (connection->state));\n#endif\n    switch (connection->state)\n    {\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_INIT:\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING:\n      connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ;\n      break;\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVED:\n      mhd_assert (0);\n      break;\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_HEADERS_RECEIVING:\n      connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ;\n      break;\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED:\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED:\n      mhd_assert (0);\n      break;\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_CONTINUE_SENDING:\n      connection->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_WRITE;\n      break;\n    case MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING:\n      if ((connection->rq.some_payload_processed) &&\n          has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer (connection))\n      {\n        /* Some data was processed, the buffer must have some free space */\n        mhd_assert (connection->read_buffer_offset < \\\n                    connection->read_buffer_size);\n        if (! connection->rq.have_chunked_upload)\n        {\n          /* Not a chunked upload.
