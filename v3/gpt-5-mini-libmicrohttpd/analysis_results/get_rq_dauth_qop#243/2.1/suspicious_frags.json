  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: the initial check (if (NULL == qop_param->value.str) return ...) is conditional and reachable when the value string is NULL; all subsequent code is executed only when that condition is false, so none of those statements are inherently unreachable. The quoted/unquoted branches are determined at runtime by qop_param->quoted; both branches are reachable depending on input. Each return inside those branches is guarded by runtime comparisons (macro calls) whose outcomes cannot be proven constant from the fragment provided, so they are not statically unreachable. The final return (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_QOP_INVALID) is reachable when none of the earlier comparisons match. There are no constant conditional expressions, no code after an unconditional return, and no obvious dead code constructs (e.g., #if 0, if (0)). Note: potential issues such as a missing null-check for the qop_param pointer itself are not related to MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) and therefore were not flagged here."
