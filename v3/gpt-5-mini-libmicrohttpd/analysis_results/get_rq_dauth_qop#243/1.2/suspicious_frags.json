  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function returning an enum, pointer-to-const struct parameters, plain if/else statements, function calls, comparisons against NULL, and standard C comments. The backslash characters shown are line-continuation sequences (backslash-newline) which are part of the C translation phases (splicing physical source lines) and are not a compiler-specific language extension. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_ functions, typeof, anonymous struct/union extensions, inline assembly, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific language features. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the code shown."
