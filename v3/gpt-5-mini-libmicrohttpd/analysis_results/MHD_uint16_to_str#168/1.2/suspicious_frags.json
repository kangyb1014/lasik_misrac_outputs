  "explanation": "I examined the function for compiler-specific language extensions. The code uses only standard C constructs and standard library macros/types: uint16_t and UINT16_C (from <stdint.h>), size_t, casts, pointer arithmetic, and conventional control flow. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions present (no __attribute__, typeof, __asm, inline assembly, statement expressions, nested functions, labels-as-values, nonstandard keywords, or other compiler-specific tokens). The mhd_assert identifier is a macro call but its expansion is not shown \u2014 its presence alone is not proof of a compiler extension; if that macro expands to an extension it would need review, but based on the provided code fragment there is no explicit use of a documented compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
