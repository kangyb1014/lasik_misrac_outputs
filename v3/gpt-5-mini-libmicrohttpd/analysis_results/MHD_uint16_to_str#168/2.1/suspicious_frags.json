  "explanation": "I identified the loop that performs the digit-by-digit output (including the conditional early return) and the final return statement as the only locations that could produce unreachable code behavior worth investigating: the early return inside the printing loop may short-circuit the remainder of the loop body and later code paths, and the trailing return is the alternative exit path. All other fragments (variable declarations/initialization, the leading-zero suppression loop, per-iteration assignments and mhd_assert calls outside the highlighted loop) are reachable in at least one realistic runtime scenario (depending on the input value and buf_size) and do not contain unconditional control-flow exits that would make following code unreachable, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
