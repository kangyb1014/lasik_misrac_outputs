  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect self-calls. In this function there are no explicit calls to MHD_uint16_to_str. The only function-like invocations present are mhd_assert calls (shown above), which could be a function or expand to code that calls other functions \u2014 therefore these lines must be investigated for possible indirect recursion. Other constructs in the function are not function calls and thus cannot cause recursion: UINT16_C is a compile-time macro (not a function call), the arithmetic operations, casts, pointer increments, comparisons, and return statements do not invoke functions. No other function-call candidates exist in the shown code fragment."
