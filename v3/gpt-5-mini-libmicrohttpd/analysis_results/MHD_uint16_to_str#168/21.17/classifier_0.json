  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 is not violated. The fragment '*chr = (char) ((char) digit + '0');' does not call any functions from <string.h>, so the specific rule (which targets use of the string.h string-handling functions) is not applicable. Note: an out-of-bounds write could still occur if buf_size does not reflect the actual allocation (e.g. caller passes a larger buf_size than the buffer), but that would be a general buffer-overflow/runtime-safety issue and not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
