  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>, none of which are called here. The pointer chr is initialized to the caller-supplied buf and incremented inside a loop guarded by buf_size (the code writes *chr, then does chr++ and buf_size--). Because the loop condition prevents entering when buf_size == 0, and buf_size is decremented after each write, the code does not perform out-of-bounds accesses of the buffer when used as shown. (Note: a NULL buf with buf_size > 0 would be undefined behaviour, but that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.)"
