  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 is not violated. The fragment does not call any <string.h> functions; it returns (size_t)(chr - buf) after writing one character. The while condition (0 != buf_size) guarantees a write occurs only when space is available, and the pointer subtraction is between pointers into the same object, so there is no out\u2011of\u2011bounds access related to string.h functions."
