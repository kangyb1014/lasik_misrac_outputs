The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I identified fragments that should be investigated for possible dead code (redundant checks, platform-conditional code, API stubs, or operations that might be no-ops). Other parts of the function were not flagged because they constitute the essential control flow and observable actions of the routine and are unlikely to be dead code: variable declarations, assignment of connection/daemon (these are used later), the switch(action) structure itself, the explicit MHD_YES returns for successful paths, and the comments/documentation lines. Those elements are core to the function's runtime behaviour and cannot be removed without changing semantics, so they do not need investigation under Rule 2.2."
