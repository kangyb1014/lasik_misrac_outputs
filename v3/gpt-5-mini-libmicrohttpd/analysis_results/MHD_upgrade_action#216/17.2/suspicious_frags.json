  "explanation": "There is no direct call to MHD_upgrade_action within this function, so no direct recursion is present. The only places that could potentially lead to indirect (mutual) recursion are external function or system calls; those are listed above for investigation. Other fragments of the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 because they are simple local variable assignments, NULL checks, switch/case flow control and direct returns of constants, or comments. The variadic parameter (ellipsis) is not used here and so cannot introduce indirect calls. In summary, only the external calls/system calls listed could possibly cause indirect recursion and therefore require further inspection; the rest of the code cannot cause the function to call itself directly or indirectly."
