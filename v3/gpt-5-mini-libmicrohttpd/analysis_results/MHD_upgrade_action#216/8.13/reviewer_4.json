True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer is declared as a modifiable pointer but is only used for read-only access. In this function 'daemon' is assigned from 'connection->daemon' and only read (e.g. checking 'daemon->options' to test MHD_USE_TLS) \u2014 it is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;'). Assigning the non-const 'connection->daemon' to a 'const struct MHD_Daemon *' is allowed, so const qualification is feasible here.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In MHD_upgrade_action the local variable daemon is assigned from connection->daemon and is only ever read (used in the test of daemon->options). There are no writes through daemon in this function, so declaring it as const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon; is feasible and would conform to the rule. Converting a struct MHD_Daemon * to const struct MHD_Daemon * is allowed without a cast, so there is no barrier to making this change. (The usual caveats apply: if later code in this function or calls made from here needed to modify the daemon via that pointer, or if daemon must be passed to APIs requiring a non-const pointer, then const would not be possible \u2014 but none of that occurs in the provided code.)"
