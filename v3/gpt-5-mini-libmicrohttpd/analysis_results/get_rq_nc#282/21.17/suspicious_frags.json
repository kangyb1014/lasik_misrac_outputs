  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 21.17 concerns uses of string functions that may access beyond the bounds of objects pointed to by pointer parameters. The code itself does not call standard <string.h> functions directly, but it calls MHD_str_unquote and MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ which operate on buffers and may internally use string functions; these calls therefore must be investigated. The unq buffer declaration and the size check (sizeof(unq) < params->nc.value.len) and the subsequent MHD_str_unquote call need review to ensure the temporary buffer cannot be overrun (including possible off-by-one issues and whether the unquote routine writes a terminator). The MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ call must be checked to ensure it does not read past val/val_len. Assigning val from nc_param->value.str and val_len = nc_param->value.len is included because this provides the pointer/length pair passed into the parsing routine and must be validated for length correctness by the caller. The access val[0] is included because it indexes the buffer and must be safe (val_len>0 is checked earlier, but the provenance of val when quoting/unquoting should be verified). Other fragments (NULL checks for nc_param->value.str, the earlier zero-length check, the comparisons of val_len and res, the numeric range checks, and the final assignment *nc = (uint32_t) nc_val) do not involve string handling or pointer/length copying and are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17, so they do not require investigation for this rule."
