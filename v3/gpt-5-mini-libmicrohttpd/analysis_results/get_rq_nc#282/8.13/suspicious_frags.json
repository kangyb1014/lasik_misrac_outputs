  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All pointer uses in this function are already const-qualified where possible or unavoidably non-const for legitimate reasons:\n\n- params is declared as const struct MHD_RqDAuth * so the function receives a pointer to const data (good for Rule 8.13).\n- nc_param is declared as const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *const (pointer to const object, pointer itself const) \u2014 already const-qualified.\n- val is declared as const char * (it points to input text that is not modified by this function), satisfying the rule.\n- When the code uses the local buffer unq (char unq[16]) and assigns its address to val, assigning a char * (array decays to char *) to a const char * is allowed and appropriate because the function will only read from the buffer via val.\n- The output parameter uint32_t *nc must be a non-const pointer because the function stores the parsed value into the caller-provided storage; making it point-to-const would be incorrect.\n- nc_val is a local numeric variable whose address is passed to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ to receive a parsed result; that requires a non-const pointer because the callee writes the result.\n\nNo other pointer declarations in this fragment could or should be further const-qualified without changing the intended semantics (e.g., turning output parameters into const would be incorrect). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 8.13 in this function."
