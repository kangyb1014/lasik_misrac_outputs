  "explanation": "I found no code fragment in completed_callback that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls). The function does not call itself directly. It does not invoke any function pointers or other callbacks that could indirectly re-enter completed_callback: only standard library/system calls are used (gettimeofday, fprintf, free) which are not user callbacks and will not call back into this function. There are no calls to the surrounding library (e.g. MHD APIs) from within this function that could cause the library to re-invoke the callback indirectly. The dereference of req_cls to obtain tv and the subsequent free(tv) release memory but do not trigger any function calls back into completed_callback. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion to warrant investigation."
