  "scenario": "As written, this fragment does not itself introduce unreachable code: the return is conditional on tv being NULL and thus can be reached at runtime if *req_cls is NULL. Therefore the rule is not violated in the shown code. (If, however, elsewhere in the project *req_cls is guaranteed to be non-NULL for every call of completed_callback \u2014 e.g. it is always set to a valid pointer and never cleared \u2014 then the if (NULL == tv) return; branch would be provably always false and thus the return branch would be unreachable, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.)"
