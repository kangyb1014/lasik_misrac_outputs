According to Rule 2.2 any executed operation whose removal does not change program behaviour is dead code, so this cast-to-void statement is dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three lines like \u201c(void) cls;\u201d are the common idiom to mark an unused parameter and suppress compiler warnings; they have no runtime effect, but removing them changes only compiler diagnostics (warnings), not the program's observable behaviour. MISRA Rule 2.2 is concerned with dead code that can be removed without changing program behaviour; the intent of the rule is to eliminate code that affects maintainability or could hide faults, not the deliberate no-op used to document/acknowledge an unused parameter. In practice MISRA guidance accepts the (void)param idiom (or other documented mechanisms) for callbacks whose signatures must match a prototype. Therefore the claim that this is a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
