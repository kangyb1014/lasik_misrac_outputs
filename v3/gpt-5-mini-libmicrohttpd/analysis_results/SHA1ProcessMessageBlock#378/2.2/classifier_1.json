Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1ProcessMessageBlock (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  const uint32_t K[] = { 0x5A827999, 0x6ED9EBA1, 0x8F1BBCDC, 0xCA62C1D6 };\n  int i;\n  uint32_t temp;\n  uint32_t W[80];\n  uint32_t A, B, C, D, E;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)\n  {\n    W[i] = ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4]) << 24;\n    W[i] |= ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4 + 1]) << 16;\n    W[i] |= ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4 + 2]) << 8;\n    W[i] |= context->message_block[i * 4 + 3];\n  }\n  for (i = 16; i < 80; i++)\n  {\n    W[i]\n      = SHA1CircularShift (1, W[i - 3] ^ W[i - 8] ^ W[i - 14] ^ W[i - 16]);\n  }\n  A = context->intermediate_hash[0];\n  B = context->intermediate_hash[1];\n  C = context->intermediate_hash[2];\n  D = context->intermediate_hash[3];\n  E = context->intermediate_hash[4];\n  for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + ((B & C) | ((~B) & D)) + E + W[i]\n           + K[0];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 20; i < 40; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + (B ^ C ^ D) + E + W[i] + K[1];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 40; i < 60; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + ((B & C) | (B & D) | (C & D)) + E\n           + W[i] + K[2];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 60; i < 80; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + (B ^ C ^ D) + E + W[i] + K[3];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] += A;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] += B;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] += C;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] += D;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] += E;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontext->intermediate_hash[0] += A;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] += B;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] += C;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] += D;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] += E;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No \u2014 these += operations are necessary to update the ongoing SHA\u20111 state. Removing them would change the resulting hash value, so they are not dead. A concrete violation would occur if the intermediate_hash elements were never read (for example, if they are overwritten immediately after this function before any use, or the API never exposes or uses intermediate_hash and the final digest is computed from a different buffer) \u2014 in that case these updates would be dead code."
