  "explanation": "All code not listed above is the in-loop state-update machinery (declarations of i, temp, the per-iteration assignments E = D; D = C; C = SHA1CircularShift(30, B); B = A; A = temp; the use of temp and the bitwise/rotation expressions inside the round computations). Those operations are visibly used by subsequent iterations and by the final accumulation into intermediate_hash, so they are not candidates for dead code. The fragments selected above are flagged for investigation because, without full project context, it is possible that one or more of them are redundant in the broader program (for example: constants or buffers defined but never needed outside this function, or final writes such as message_block_index = 0 or intermediate_hash updates that might be overwritten/unused elsewhere). Reviewers should check usage across the project to determine whether those statements have any observable effect and therefore whether they violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
