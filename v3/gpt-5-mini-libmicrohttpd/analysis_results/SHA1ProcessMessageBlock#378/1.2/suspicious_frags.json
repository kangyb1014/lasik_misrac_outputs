  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, a struct pointer parameter, stdint.h types (uint32_t), array initialiser with implicit size (const uint32_t K[] = {...}), ordinary arrays and indexing, for-loops, bitwise/shift operators, and ordinary function calls (SHA1CircularShift). There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, __typeof__, __builtin_*, no inline assembly, no GCC/Clang/MSC extensions), no variable-length arrays with non-constant sizes, no designated initializers, and no C++-only constructs. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If your toolchain documents any of the used identifiers/types (e.g. uint32_t or SHA1CircularShift) as non-standard extensions, those should be reported, but based on standard C and typical C library headers nothing in this function is a language extension."
