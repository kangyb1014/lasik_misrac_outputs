  "explanation": "The only function calls present in this function are invocations of SHA1CircularShift; these calls are potential sources of indirect recursion only if SHA1CircularShift (or a chain it calls) calls back into SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (or itself). No other function calls appear in this code: the rest are assignments, array accesses, bitwise/arithmetical operations, loop constructs and constant initializations, none of which can introduce recursion. There are no function-pointer invocations, macros that expand to function calls, or other callable entities in this fragment that would need investigation for Rule 17.2."
