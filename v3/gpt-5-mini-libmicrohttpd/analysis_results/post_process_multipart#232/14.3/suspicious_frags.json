  "explanation": "I flagged all control statements whose controlling expressions could become invariant in practice or where the checked buffer index uses buf[0]/buf[1] (which is suspicious because the code tracks an offset ioff separately). These are the places to investigate for Rule 14.3: the top-level while loop condition (it can become effectively constant if state transitions stop happening), both switch statements (their controlling variables are mutated inside the loop and via goto/AGAIN \u2014 verify they are actually changed on each iteration), and all if-tests that inspect buf[0] or buf[1] (those tests may repeatedly evaluate the same memory location while ioff is managed separately, possibly making the controlling expression effectively invariant during parts of the loop). I also included the compound if that checks (0 == max) && (0 == state_changed) && (poff < post_data_len) because that combination can freeze loop progress and create an invariant condition that should be reviewed.\n\nI did not mark other statements (e.g. calls to process_multipart_headers, process_value_to_boundary, MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_, strdup, free, memmove, the end-of-function checks like if (poff < post_data_len), etc.) because their controlling expressions depend on function return values or variables that are clearly updated by the code paths shown. Those are data-dependent and not compile-time constant/invariant in the same way; they either modify state, depend on external data, or are covered by the allowed exceptions (e.g., legitimate infinite loops). The fragments I listed are the primary candidates where a controlling expression might be invariant in practice and therefore warrant focused investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
