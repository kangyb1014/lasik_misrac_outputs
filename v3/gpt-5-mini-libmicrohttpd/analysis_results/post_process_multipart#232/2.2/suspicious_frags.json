  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are potentially \"dead\" or at least suspicious under MISRA C Rule 2.2 because they appear to execute operations whose effect might be unobservable (or redundant) and therefore warrant manual inspection:\n\n- Calls where the return value is explicitly discarded (the (void) find_boundary(...) call). If find_boundary has no side effects relevant to subsequent behavior, discarding its result could indicate dead/meaningless operations.\n\n- Assignments to state/flags immediately followed by a return (several occurrences of pp->state = PP_Error; return MHD_NO; and the RN_Full block which assigns pp->skip_rn and then returns). If the updated fields are never observed after the immediate return, those assignments may be dead (executed but removable without changing observable behavior).\n\n- Two memmove blocks (the one at the AGAIN label and the one at END) perform the same operation; their co-existence invites review to ensure neither is redundant in practice (i.e. executed in all scenarios where the other also executes).\n\n- The final default/panic block grouping several states into a panic is worth checking: if some of those case labels are never reachable in normal operation, the panic call may never be executed (not a dead-code violation by itself), but the presence of unreachable states or panics can mask dead code or unhandled state-machine transitions.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT marked:\n- The bulk of the function is a state-machine that reads/writes pp fields, calls helper functions, moves buffer data, and changes control flow (goto AGAIN / goto END). Those operations have obvious side-effects or alter control flow in ways that are used later in the function; they therefore are unlikely to be dead code without deeper cross-module knowledge. Examples: memcpy/memmove that update buffer contents and buffer_pos; updates to value_offset, nested_boundary handling (strdup/free), and calls to process_multipart_headers/process_value_to_boundary/find_boundary which are likely to have side effects driving the state machine. Removing these would almost certainly change runtime behavior.\n\n- Fall-throughs in the skip_rn switch are annotated (/* fall-through! */) and appear intentional for the state machine; these are control-flow constructs rather than dead statements.\n\n- Assignments and flag updates that are followed by further state-machine processing (e.g., state_changed = 1/0 at various points, setting pp->have bits, freeing resources) are used later in the function or by helper functions and thus are not flagged as dead without analysis beyond this single function.\n\nBecause MISRA Rule 2.2 requires removal of code that can be executed yet be removed without affecting program behavior, the fragments above are places where that condition is plausible and therefore should be investigated. The rest of the function contains active state-machine logic and side-effecting calls, so they are not marked as suspicious for dead code in this pass."
