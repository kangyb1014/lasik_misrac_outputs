  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect function recursion. The only places in this function that can introduce (direct or indirect) calls back into try_grow_read_buffer are the actual function/macro invocations. Therefore I reported every function-like call/usage present in the code: MHD_pool_get_free, MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace, MHD_pool_reallocate, and all mhd_assert invocations (the assert macro may expand to a function-like handler). All other code fragments are plain expressions, assignments, arithmetic, comparisons, control-flow constructs and comments that do not perform calls and therefore cannot by themselves cause recursion; they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. If investigation shows any of the reported functions or assert handlers call into library code that may re-enter this function, those call sites should be examined further."
