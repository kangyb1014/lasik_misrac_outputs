True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe assignment connection->read_buffer = rb; is redundant because, earlier, the code ensures the buffer will not be moved (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace returned true) and then reallocated into rb. An assertion immediately before the assignment (mhd_assert(connection->read_buffer == rb)) documents that rb equals the existing pointer. Therefore the write assigns the same value already held and removing it would not change program behaviour \u2014 i.e. it is dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 prohibits code that is provably dead (i.e. its removal cannot affect program behaviour). The assignment connection->read_buffer = rb; is not provably without effect:\n\n- The earlier check only prevents the case where an existing buffer would be moved if MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace(...) returns false. It does not guarantee at compile time that rb will equal the old pointer in all builds or for all pool implementations. If the pool implementation returns a different pointer from MHD_pool_reallocate(), the assignment is required to update the connection structure.\n- connection->read_buffer may be NULL on entry; in that case the assignment stores the newly allocated pointer into the structure and is clearly required.\n- The mhd_assert(...) is a runtime check used for debugging and is typically compiled out in production builds. An assert does not establish a compile-time guarantee that the value is equal, so it cannot be used to prove the assignment is dead.\n\nBecause the assignment can affect program behaviour in realistic scenarios and is not provably redundant, it is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
