  "scenario": "No \u2014 not necessarily violated. In this code strcmp(cookie, ret->sid) is safe provided both operands are valid NUL\u2011terminated character arrays: ret->sid is filled with snprintf(ret->sid, sizeof(ret->sid), ...) (so it is bounded and NUL\u2011terminated when sizeof(ret->sid) > 0) and cookie is obtained from MHD_lookup_connection_value which (by its API contract) returns a NUL\u2011terminated C string. Under those assumptions the call does not read beyond object bounds. A violation scenario would occur if either operand is not NUL\u2011terminated (for example ret->sid was corrupted or previously written without a terminator, or MHD_lookup_connection_value returned a non\u2011terminated buffer) \u2014 then strcmp could read past the buffer and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
