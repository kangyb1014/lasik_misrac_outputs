  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs and standard library functions: function definition with a pointer return type, pointer and struct usage, string and memory functions (strcmp, calloc, fprintf, strerror), macros/identifiers (NULL, errno), formatted I/O (snprintf with explicit casts to unsigned int for %X), rand(), time(), sizeof, and simple control flow. There are no compiler-specific keywords or builtins (for example no __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, or other vendor-specific tokens), no inline assembly, no GCC/Clang/MSC pragmas, nor other documented compiler extensions. Library calls such as MHD_lookup_connection_value and identifiers like COOKIE_NAME are user/library symbols, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
