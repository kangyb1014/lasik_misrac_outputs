  "explanation": "The only function parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection'. In the function body there is no assignment to the parameter (no statements like 'connection = ...', 'connection++', or similar). 'connection' is only used as an rvalue argument to MHD_lookup_connection_value; passing the pointer by value to a callee does not modify the caller's parameter. All other pointers in the code (ret, sessions, cookie) are local variables or globals \u2014 Rule 17.8 applies to function parameters only, so modifications to objects pointed to by non-parameter pointers or to global pointers are outside this rule. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
