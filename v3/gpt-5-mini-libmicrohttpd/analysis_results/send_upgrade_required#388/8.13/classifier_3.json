  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The pointer 'res' refers to a mutable response object that is passed to functions that modify or destroy it (MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response), so it must be a pointer to a non-const struct. A violation would occur if 'res' were only read (never modified) and/or only passed to functions accepting 'const struct MHD_Response *' but was declared without the const qualifier."
