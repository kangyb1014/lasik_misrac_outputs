  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code contains only standard C constructs: a static function definition, enum return type, struct pointers, function calls, an if statement, a cast to (const void *), and macro identifiers (MHD_*, UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE, etc.). None of the following compiler-specific or nonstandard constructs are present: __attribute__ or other compiler attributes, inline assembler (asm), GCC/Clang statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, __extension__, __builtin_* calls, labels-as-values, nonstandard inline semantics, or other documented compiler extensions. The cast (const void *) on the string macro is a standard C cast and the identifier suffix \u201c_static\u201d in the function name is part of the library API, not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
