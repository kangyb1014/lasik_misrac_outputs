  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code fragment. The only function parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *con' and there is no assignment to 'con' or any pointer arithmetic on it; it is only passed by value to MHD_queue_response, which is permitted. Local variables ('res', 'ret') are used and passed to helper functions, but these are not function parameters. The pointer 'UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE' is cast to const void* when passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, indicating no modification of that object here. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
