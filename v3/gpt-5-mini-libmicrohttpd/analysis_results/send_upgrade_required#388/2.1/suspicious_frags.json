  "explanation": "No unreachable-code fragments were found in this function. Reasoning: \n- There are no constant-condition branches (no if (0) or if (1)) that would make a block impossible to reach. The only conditional is the runtime check on the return value of MHD_add_response_header, and both the true and false paths are reachable depending on that function's result. \n- The early return inside the if-block is reachable when MHD_add_response_header indicates failure; it does not render subsequent statements in the function unreachable because those statements are executed when the condition is false. \n- There are no goto labels, switch cases, or fall-throughs that would create unreachable statements. \n- The function-level return at the end is the normal exit point and is reachable whenever the if-condition is false. \n- Potential runtime issues (e.g. MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static returning NULL) are not instances of unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1; they are runtime error/robustness concerns and should be checked under other rules. \nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to be statically unreachable and needing investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
