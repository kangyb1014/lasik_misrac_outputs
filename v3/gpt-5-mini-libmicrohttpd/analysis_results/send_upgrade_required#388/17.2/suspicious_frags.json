  "explanation": "I did not find any direct call from send_upgrade_required to itself. The remaining code fragments were not flagged because they are simple declarations or local control-flow statements that cannot cause recursion by themselves: the function header and local variable declarations (struct MHD_Response *res; enum MHD_Result ret;), the final return statement (return ret;), and simple assignments unrelated to calling other functions. The only places that could possibly introduce indirect recursion are calls to external/library functions; those calls are included above for investigation."
