  "scenario": "The call MHD_destroy_response(res) is not a call to the current function (send_upgrade_required), so there is no direct recursion. Given only this fragment, there is no evidence of indirect recursion either \u2014 unless the library function MHD_destroy_response (or functions it calls, e.g. user callbacks invoked during destruction) were implemented to call send_upgrade_required (directly or via a call chain), which would create an indirect recursion. With the provided code, no such call chain is present, so no MISRA Rule 17.2 violation is shown."
