  "scenario": "No violation. In this fragment both sides are the same callback function-pointer type (MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback) so const-qualification of the pointed-to type is not applicable \u2014 you cannot qualify a function type with const in a meaningful way. The assignment simply stores the function pointer in the struct. (If instead these were object pointers and the struct member omitted a needed const-qualified pointee type, then assigning a non-const/non-const-matching pointer could constitute a Rule 8.13 violation.)"
