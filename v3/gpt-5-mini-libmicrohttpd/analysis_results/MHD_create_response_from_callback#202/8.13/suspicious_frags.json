  "explanation": "I did not select other fragments because they do not pertain to pointer-to-const qualification (the focus of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13). Examples of not-selected items: NULL checks, integer assignments (fd, data_buffer_size, reference_count, total_size), memory allocation and free, mutex initialization, and the function return statement \u2014 these lines do not declare or initialize pointers that could be const-qualified. Also, declarations/typedefs that determine whether a pointer can be const (such as the actual typedefs for the callback types and the definition of struct MHD_Response) are not present in the snippet; determining const-qualification for those requires inspecting those external definitions, so they were not assumed or flagged here."
