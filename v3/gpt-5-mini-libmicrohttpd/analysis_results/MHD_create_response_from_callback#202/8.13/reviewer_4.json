True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf both the parameter 'crc_cls' and the struct member 'response->crc_cls' are declared as plain 'void *' (non-const), then this assignment leaves the pointer unqualified even though it is typically used as a read-only/context pointer. In that case Rule 8.13 is violated (e.g. passing a pointer to static configuration or a literal should use 'const void *'). The fix is to declare the parameter and the struct member as 'const void *' so the assignment preserves const qualification.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Agent A\u2019s observation (that crc_cls and response->crc_cls are plain void * rather than const void *) is a valid stylistic/qualitative concern: if the context pointer is only intended for read-only/context data, it should indeed be declared as const void * to satisfy the spirit of 8.13.\n\nHowever, whether the code actually violates MISRA 8.13 cannot be determined from this isolated function alone. The function simply stores the incoming crc_cls in the response struct; there is no evidence here whether the data pointed to is ever modified elsewhere (including inside the callbacks or other code that accesses response->crc_cls). If the pointed-to object is ever modified, the non-const declaration is appropriate and no violation occurs. If the pointed-to object is never modified, then the pointer could and should be const-qualified and leaving it as void * would be a violation.\n\nSo Agent A\u2019s recommendation (declare the parameter and struct member as const void * when they are used only for read-only context) is correct advice. But the claim that this particular snippet definitely violates MISRA 8.13 is not provable from the snippet alone \u2014 you must inspect all uses of crc_cls/response->crc_cls. Therefore the report as a definite violation is not conclusively correct.\n\nRecommendation: review all callsites and uses of crc_cls/response->crc_cls. If the data is never modified, change the API/struct to use const void * (and update related callback signatures) to comply with Rule 8.13. If the data is modified, keep void * and document why const cannot be used."
