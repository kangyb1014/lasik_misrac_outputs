  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code snippet. In particular:\n\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__(...), __declspec(...), __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), or other documented compiler extensions.\n- The leading token _MHD_EXTERN is a macro identifier only; its expansion (which might contain an extension) is not shown in this snippet, so the code as given does not itself contain an explicit language extension.\n- Use of standard types uint64_t and size_t are from standard headers (stdint.h / stddef.h) and are not extensions.\n- Pointer arithmetic (&response[1]) and the pattern of allocating extra bytes after a struct are standard-conforming C idioms (though one might prefer a C99 flexible array member, this is not a compiler extension).\n- Conditional compilation (#if defined(...)) and calls to project-specific functions/macros (MHD_calloc_, MHD_mutex_init_) are preprocessor and library usages, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions and nothing here requires investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 based on the provided code alone. If you can provide macro definitions (e.g., the definition of _MHD_EXTERN) or compiler-specific headers, those expansions should be rechecked because they could hide extensions."
