Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_callback:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_callback (uint64_t size,\n                                   size_t block_size,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderCallback crc,\n                                   void *crc_cls,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size))\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL == (response = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response)\n                                       + block_size)))\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = -1;\n  response->data = (void *) &response[1];\n  response->data_buffer_size = block_size;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the given context. The assignment response->reference_count = 1 is an initialization of the newly allocated response object and is expected to be used by the response lifecycle (reference counting on add/release). There is no evidence in the snippet that the assignment is overwritten or never read. A concrete violation scenario would be if, elsewhere in the project, the field is always overwritten before any read or never accessed at all \u2014 for example, if immediately after this function returns every caller sets response->reference_count = 2 unconditionally (or the code never reads reference_count), then the assignment would be dead code because removing it would not change program behaviour."
