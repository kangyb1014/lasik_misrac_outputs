  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_callback:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_callback (uint64_t size,\n                                   size_t block_size,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderCallback crc,\n                                   void *crc_cls,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size))\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL == (response = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response)\n                                       + block_size)))\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = -1;\n  response->data = (void *) &response[1];\n  response->data_buffer_size = block_size;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical use: this assignment initializes the response->data_buffer_size field so later code (e.g. content reader callbacks or response handling) can rely on the buffer size. Removing it would change program behaviour if that field is read. However, a concrete violation scenario would be: the project never reads response->data_buffer_size (or always overwrites it before any read) anywhere in the codebase \u2014 in that case the assignment is dead code because its removal would not affect behaviour."
