  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: the code only allocates memory (via MHD_calloc_) and does not call any of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, a Rule 21.17 violation could occur elsewhere if subsequent use of string functions (for example memcpy/strncpy/strncat) copies more than response->data_buffer_size bytes into response->data. Another potential indirect issue is integer overflow in the expression sizeof(struct MHD_Response) + block_size: if that addition wraps, the allocated buffer may be smaller than intended and later string handling calls could then access beyond the allocated bounds."
