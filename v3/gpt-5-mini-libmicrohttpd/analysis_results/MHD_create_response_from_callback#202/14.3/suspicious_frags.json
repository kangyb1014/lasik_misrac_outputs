  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size)) return NULL; \u2014 this controlling expression depends on the function parameter crc and the parameter block_size (a runtime value), so it is not invariant.\n\n- if (NULL == (response = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response) + block_size))) return NULL; \u2014 the expression performs an assignment from a runtime allocation call; its result depends on the allocator and is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- #if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) is a preprocessor conditional, not a C controlling expression governed by Rule 14.3 at runtime. The enclosed if (! MHD_mutex_init_ (&response->mutex)) { ... } \u2014 the condition depends on the result of MHD_mutex_init_(), a runtime function, so it is not invariant.\n\n- There are no loops in the function (no while, do-while, for) except for the preprocessor conditional which is not a runtime control expression; therefore the rule exceptions (infinite loops or a specific do-while constant-false case) are not relevant here.\n\nBecause every conditional depends on runtime parameters or function returns (not compile-time constants), there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to report."
