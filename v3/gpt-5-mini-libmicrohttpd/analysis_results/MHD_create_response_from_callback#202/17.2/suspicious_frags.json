  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not perform function calls or otherwise can not lead to direct or indirect invocation of MHD_create_response_from_callback and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. Specifically: the initial NULL-check (if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size)) return NULL;) only inspects parameters; the memory layout/assignment lines (response->fd = -1; response->data = (void *) &response[1]; response->data_buffer_size = block_size; response->reference_count = 1; response->total_size = size; return response;) are simple assignments or returns and do not invoke any functions that could cause recursion. The selected fragments are the only places in this function that call other functions (MHD_calloc_, MHD_mutex_init_, free) or store callback function pointers (crc, crfc, crc_cls) that could later be invoked and thus merit investigation for potential indirect self-calls."
