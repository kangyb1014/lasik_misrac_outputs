  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. None of the function parameters (size, block_size, crc, crc_cls, crfc) are assigned to or otherwise modified inside the function. The code only reads these parameters (checks crc and block_size for NULL/zero, passes block_size to allocation, and stores pointer values into members of the newly allocated response structure). Storing a pointer parameter value into a structure member does not modify the parameter itself. There are no dereferences or assignments that alter the objects of pointer parameters via the parameter variable. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
