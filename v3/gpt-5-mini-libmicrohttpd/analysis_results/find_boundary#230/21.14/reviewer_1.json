  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings (i.e. using memcmp as a string comparison function). In this code memcmp(\"--\", buf, 2) compares exactly two bytes \u2014 the two '-' characters \u2014 and does not rely on, nor compare, the terminating '\\0' of the string literal. The memcmp calls in this function compare fixed byte ranges (a two\u2011byte prefix and blen bytes) rather than treating the operands as null\u2011terminated C strings. Therefore the code is not using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings and does not violate Rule 21.14. If the intent were to compare full null\u2011terminated strings, then using memcmp would be inappropriate; however that is not the case here."
