  "explanation": "Only the two memcmp calls need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings). All other fragments do not perform string comparisons via memcmp and therefore are not relevant to this rule: the initial buffer-size check (if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen)), the pp->state assignments and error handling, the commented out ++(*ioffptr), the use of memchr to search for a '-' byte (this is a byte search, not a string comparison), the arithmetic updating (*ioffptr), and the final state/flag updates (pp->skip_rn, pp->state, pp->dash_state) are not uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings and need not be investigated for Rule 21.14."
