  "explanation": "Only the two calls to external/library functions (memcmp and memchr) are function-call sites in this function and thus are the only points that could (in an indirect or implementation-specific way) lead to further function execution that should be checked for indirect recursion. There are no direct calls to find_boundary, no other function calls, and no invocation of function pointers in the shown code. The function is declared static (no external linkage), and the rest of the code consists of member access, assignments, arithmetic on pointers/indices, returns and macro constants \u2014 none of which can themselves cause a call chain leading back to find_boundary. Therefore other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
