  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. The function contains only if/else conditionals (no for/while/do-while loops) and each controlling expression depends on runtime values or function calls, for example:\n- if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen)\n- if (pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size)\n- if ((0 != memcmp (\"--\", buf, 2)) || (0 != memcmp (&buf[2], boundary, blen)))\n- if (pp->state != PP_Init)\n- if (NULL == dash)\n- else if (dash == buf)\nAll of these depend on pp fields, blen, buffer contents, or memchr/memcmp results and therefore are not constant/invariant expressions. There are no do-while loops or other constructs that would fall under the allowed exceptions (infinite loop or the specific do-while constant-false exception). Consequently, there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
