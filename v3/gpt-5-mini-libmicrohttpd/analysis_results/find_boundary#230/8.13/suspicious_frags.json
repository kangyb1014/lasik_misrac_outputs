  "explanation": "I have not flagged other pointer uses because they do not violate Rule 8.13 or cannot reasonably be made const: the parameter 'struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp' is written to (pp->state, pp->skip_rn, pp->dash_state), so it cannot be const; 'size_t *ioffptr' is intentionally modified via (*ioffptr) so it must be non-const; 'boundary' is already const-qualified; 'dash' is declared const char *; string literal usages (\"--\") are inherently read-only. The listed fragments are the places where a pointer to buffer data is created/used as a non-const char * even though the code treats the data as read-only and therefore should be investigated for possible const-qualification."
