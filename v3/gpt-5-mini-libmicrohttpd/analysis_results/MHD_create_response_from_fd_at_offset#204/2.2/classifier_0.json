  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (size_t size,\n                                       int fd,\n                                       off_t offset)\n{\n  if (0 > offset)\n    return NULL;\n  return MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 (size,\n                                                  fd,\n                                                  (uint64_t) offset);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 > offset)\n    return NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The check 'if (0 > offset) return NULL;' is not dead code in general: it prevents negative offsets from being passed to the 64-bit wrapper and removing it would change behaviour if a caller can supply a negative off_t. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. (A concrete violation scenario would exist only if negative offsets are provably impossible\u2014for example, if off_t were an unsigned type on the target or all call sites are statically guaranteed to pass non\u2011negative values\u2014making the test redundant; in that case the operation would be dead and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
