  "scenario": "If off_t is an unsigned integer type (for example typedef unsigned long off_t), the controlling expression '0 > offset' is always false (invariant) and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. If off_t is a signed type (the typical case), the expression is not invariant and there is no violation."
