  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify a function parameter itself. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 prohibits changing the pointer parameter variable (e.g., password = ..., connection = ...), while permitting modification of the object pointed to (e.g., *password = ... or connection->...). In this function: \n- There are assignments to *password (allocation and final *password = NULL) \u2014 these modify the object referenced by the pointer parameter, which is allowed by the rule. \n- There are no assignments to the parameter variables password or connection themselves (no statements like password = ... or connection = ...). \n- All other assignments and frees operate on local variables (info, username) or on the objects pointed to, not on the parameter pointers. \nTherefore, no fragments need investigation under Rule 17.8."
