  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) whose controlling expressions could be constant; the only control constructs are if statements and they all depend on runtime values:\n\n- if (NULL == info) \u2014 depends on the return value of MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3(connection).\n- if (NULL != info->password) \u2014 depends on the contents of the returned info structure.\n- if (NULL != username) \u2014 depends on the result of malloc.\n- if (NULL != password) \u2014 depends on the caller-supplied parameter.\n- if (NULL != *password) \u2014 depends on the result of the second malloc.\n- the final if (NULL != password) \u2014 again depends on the caller-supplied parameter.\n\nEach of these expressions can evaluate differently at runtime (allocation success/failure, pointer values, input parameters), so none are invariant and none violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report."
