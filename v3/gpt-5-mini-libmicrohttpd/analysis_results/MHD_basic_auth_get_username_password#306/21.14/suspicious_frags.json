  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function. There are no calls to memcmp or any other use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The code uses memcpy for copying and direct indexing (e.g. mhd_assert (0 == username[info->username_len])) to check the terminating NUL; these are not memcmp-based string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If you need broader coverage, you should search other translation units for memcmp usage against null-terminated strings.)"
