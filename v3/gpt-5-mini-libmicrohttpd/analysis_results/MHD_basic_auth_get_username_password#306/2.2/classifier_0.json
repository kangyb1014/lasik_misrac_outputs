  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN char *\nMHD_basic_auth_get_username_password (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                                      char **password)\n{\n  struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo *info;\n\n  info = MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3 (connection);\n  if (NULL == info)\n    return NULL;\n\n  /* For backward compatibility this function must return NULL if\n   * no password is provided */\n  if (NULL != info->password)\n  {\n    char *username;\n\n    username = malloc (info->username_len + 1);\n    if (NULL != username)\n    {\n      memcpy (username, info->username, info->username_len + 1);\n      mhd_assert (0 == username[info->username_len]);\n      if (NULL != password)\n      {\n        *password = malloc (info->password_len + 1);\n        if (NULL != *password)\n        {\n          memcpy (*password, info->password, info->password_len + 1);\n          mhd_assert (0 == (*password)[info->password_len]);\n\n          free (info);\n          return username; /* Success exit point */\n        }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n        else\n          MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                    _ (\"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        free (info);\n        return username; /* Success exit point */\n      }\n\n      free (username);\n    }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    else\n      MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                _ (\"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n\n  }\n  free (info);\n  if (NULL != password)\n    *password = NULL;\n  return NULL;  /* Failure exit point */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n        else\n          MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                    _ (\"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment is the else branch associated with the malloc(username) check and is executed when username == NULL (malloc failure). When HAVE_MESSAGES is defined it emits a diagnostic log; removing it would change observable behavior (diagnostic output). Therefore this code is reachable and not dead code."
