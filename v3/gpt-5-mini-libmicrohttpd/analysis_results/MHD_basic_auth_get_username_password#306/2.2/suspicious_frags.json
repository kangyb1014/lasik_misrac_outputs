  "explanation": "All other operations in this function perform observable actions that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code: the call to MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3() determines whether processing continues; the NULL checks control flow; the malloc() calls allocate memory required for returned values; the memcpy() calls transfer data to the returned buffers; the free() calls and return statements affect resource management and observable results (returned pointers and output parameter); setting *password = NULL on failure is a visible side effect. Those operations cannot be removed without changing the function's behaviour, so they need not be investigated for Rule 2.2. The fragments reported above are suspicious because the assertions and conditional logging are compiled/configured features that may be no-ops in some builds (thus potentially executed code that does not affect behaviour), so they warrant further investigation."
