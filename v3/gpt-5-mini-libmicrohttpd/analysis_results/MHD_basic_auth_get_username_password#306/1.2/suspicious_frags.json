  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the provided function body. Specifically, there are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), asm(), anonymous structs/unions (not used here), or other vendor-specific keywords visible in this snippet. The identifiers that begin with an underscore (e.g. _MHD_EXTERN) and macros (mhd_assert, MHD_DLOG, _) are ordinary tokens in the source but do not themselves prove use of a language extension; their definitions are outside the provided fragment. If any of those macros expand to compiler-specific extensions, that would be an issue, but such expansions are not present in this code fragment itself and therefore cannot be reported here. For the provided code only, there are no language-extension occurrences to investigate."
