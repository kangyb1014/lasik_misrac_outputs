  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ws_get_accept_value:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nws_get_accept_value (const char *key, char **val)\n{\n  struct SHA1Context ctx;\n  unsigned char hash[SHA1HashSize];\n  char *str;\n  ssize_t len;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) || (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen (key)))\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  str = malloc (WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  if (NULL == str)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  strncpy (str, key, (WS_KEY_LEN + 1));\n  strncpy (str + WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  SHA1Reset (&ctx);\n  SHA1Input (&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN);\n  if (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash))\n  {\n    free (str);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  free (str);\n  len = BASE64Encode (hash, SHA1HashSize, val);\n  if (-1 == len)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  (*val)[len] = '\\0';\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash))\n  {\n    free (str);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-branch is reachable and its operations are necessary: SHA1Result has side effects and indicates failure, so freeing str and returning MHD_NO are required. Removing the free would leak memory; removing the return would let the function continue with an invalid/untested hash and change program behaviour. Therefore this is not dead code."
