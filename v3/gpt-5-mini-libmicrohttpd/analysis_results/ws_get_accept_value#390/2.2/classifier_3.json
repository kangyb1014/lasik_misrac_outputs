  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ws_get_accept_value:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nws_get_accept_value (const char *key, char **val)\n{\n  struct SHA1Context ctx;\n  unsigned char hash[SHA1HashSize];\n  char *str;\n  ssize_t len;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) || (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen (key)))\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  str = malloc (WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  if (NULL == str)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  strncpy (str, key, (WS_KEY_LEN + 1));\n  strncpy (str + WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  SHA1Reset (&ctx);\n  SHA1Input (&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN);\n  if (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash))\n  {\n    free (str);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  free (str);\n  len = BASE64Encode (hash, SHA1HashSize, val);\n  if (-1 == len)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  (*val)[len] = '\\0';\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstrncpy (str, key, (WS_KEY_LEN + 1));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to strncpy populates the first WS_KEY_LEN bytes (and the terminating NUL) of str with the key. If this call were removed, str would not contain the key at the start (it would be uninitialized), so the subsequent strncpy of the GUID and the SHA1Input call would produce different hash/input and thus different program behaviour. Therefore the operation is not dead code."
