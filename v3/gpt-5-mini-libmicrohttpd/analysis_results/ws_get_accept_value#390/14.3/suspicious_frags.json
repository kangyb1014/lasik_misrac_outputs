  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains only if-statements whose conditions depend on runtime information: \n- if ((NULL == key) || (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen (key))) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of key and the result of strlen(key).  \n- if (NULL == str) \u2014 depends on the runtime return of malloc.  \n- if (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash)) \u2014 depends on the runtime result of SHA1Result.  \n- if (-1 == len) \u2014 depends on the runtime return of BASE64Encode.  \nThere are no iteration statements (for/while/do-while) in this function whose controlling expressions could be invariant. Therefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant), there are no fragments that require further investigation."
