  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are demonstrably unreachable (i.e., code that can never execute) in this function. The early return if (NULL == content) is a reachable control-flow path when content is NULL; the remaining statements (strlen(header); strlen(content); and the final return with the ternary) are reachable when content is non-NULL. Both outcomes of the ternary operator depend on the runtime result of add_response_entry_n and therefore are reachable. There is no code after an unconditional return, no constant-false/constant-true condition that makes a block permanently dead, and no unconditional infinite loop that prevents later statements from executing. Note: there is a potential robustness/undefined-behavior concern (header is not NULL-checked before calling strlen), but that is not an instance of unreachable code (MISRA C Rule 2.1) and thus not included as a suspicious fragment for this rule."
