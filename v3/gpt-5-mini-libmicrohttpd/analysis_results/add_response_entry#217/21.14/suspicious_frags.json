  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp appears in the provided code fragment. The function calls strlen to obtain lengths and then forwards those lengths to add_response_entry_n; therefore there is no comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp to investigate for Rule 21.14. (Other potential issues such as strlen(header) without a header NULL check are outside the scope of Rule 21.14 and so are not reported here.)"
