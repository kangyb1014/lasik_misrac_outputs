  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_response_entry:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nadd_response_entry (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                    enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                    const char *header,\n                    const char *content)\n{\n  size_t header_len;\n  size_t content_len;\n\n  if (NULL == content)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  header_len = strlen (header);\n  content_len = strlen (content);\n  return add_response_entry_n (response, kind, header,\n                               header_len, content,\n                               content_len) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The expression returns MHD_YES or MHD_NO based on the runtime result of add_response_entry_n(), so the call and the ternary selection affect program behaviour and are not dead. (Only in a hypothetical situation where add_response_entry_n() is provably constant at compile time\u2014e.g. always returns non\u2011zero\u2014would one branch be permanently unused and thus constitute dead code, but that cannot be determined from this fragment.)"
