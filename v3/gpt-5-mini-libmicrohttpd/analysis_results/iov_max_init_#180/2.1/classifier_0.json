  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the #if defined(IOV_MAX) branch is conditionally compiled and can be reached in builds where IOV_MAX is defined and at runtime when sysconf() returns a negative value. A violation would arise only if the project/build configuration guarantees that IOV_MAX is always defined (or always undefined), making the opposite alternative (the #else branch) never present in any build \u2014 in that case the unused branch in every build would be unreachable and would violate Rule 2.1."
