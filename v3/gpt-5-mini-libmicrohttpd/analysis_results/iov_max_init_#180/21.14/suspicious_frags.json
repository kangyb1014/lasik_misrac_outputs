  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string-comparison function are present in the provided code. The function only calls sysconf, performs an integer comparison (res >= 0), casts to unsigned long, and assigns either a macro (IOV_MAX) or a numeric constant. There is no handling of null-terminated strings or any use of memcmp to compare strings, so there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14. Preprocessor branches only select integer constants and are not relevant to this rule."
