  "explanation": "There are no explicit calls to iov_max_init_ within this function (no direct recursion). The only function call inside is sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX) \u2014 this should be investigated to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call iov_max_init_. The preprocessor branches involving IOV_MAX and the assignments/casts (mhd_iov_max_ = (unsigned long) res; and mhd_iov_max_ = 8;) are not function calls and therefore cannot create recursion, so they need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
