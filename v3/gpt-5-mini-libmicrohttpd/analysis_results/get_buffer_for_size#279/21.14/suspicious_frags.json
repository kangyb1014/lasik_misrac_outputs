  "explanation": "I searched the provided function for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any string-comparison operations that could indicate memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings. No calls to memcmp (or other string comparison functions) appear in this code. The function only manipulates buffers, sizes, pointers, malloc/free, and assertions; none of these invoke memcmp or perform string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used elsewhere in the codebase \u2014 e.g. where the returned buffer is later compared \u2014 those sites would need review, but they are not present in this fragment.)"
