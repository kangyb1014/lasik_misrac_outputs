  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the control-flow and assertion points that could render subsequent code paths unreachable or indicate contradictory invariants; they therefore merit investigation for Rule 2.1. Other parts of the function (simple variable declarations/returns within those branches) do not introduce additional unreachable code beyond these control points and are reachable under appropriate input conditions. The function's control flow is fully covered by the conditionals and the assertions above; no other lines create independent unreachable paths that need investigation."
