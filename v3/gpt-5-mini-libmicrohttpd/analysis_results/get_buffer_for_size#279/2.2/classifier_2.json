The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_buffer_for_size:\n```c\nstatic char *\nget_buffer_for_size (char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                     char **ptmp2,\n                     size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                     size_t required_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || \\\n              (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size));\n\n  if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n    return tmp1;\n\n  if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n    return *ptmp2;\n\n  if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL != *ptmp2)\n    free (*ptmp2);\n  *ptmp2 = (char *) malloc (required_size);\n  if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n    *ptmp2_size = 0;\n  else\n    *ptmp2_size = required_size;\n  return *ptmp2;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The mhd_assert call is a runtime invariant check. Its presence can change program behaviour when the invariant fails (e.g. abort/log), so it is not an operation that can be removed without affecting behaviour. The asserted expression has no side-effects; if the assert macro is compiled out it is simply not executed (and thus not \u2018dead code\u2019 by the rule). Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
