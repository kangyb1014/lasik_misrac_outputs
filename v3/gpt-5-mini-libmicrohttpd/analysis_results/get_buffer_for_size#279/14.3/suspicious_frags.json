  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are obviously invariant and therefore none require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Reasoning by control point:\n\n- mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2)) and mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size)) are assertions (diagnostic checks), not flow-control statements; they do not create program control invariants to be checked for Rule 14.3. Even if compiled out, they do not make any subsequent if() conditions invariant.\n\n- mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size)) documents an expectation about *ptmp2_size (either 0 or > static buffer size). This does not by itself make any of the later if conditions invariant because required_size is an independent parameter and *ptmp2_size may be either 0 or a value > _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE at runtime.\n\n- if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n  - Depends on runtime parameter required_size and a compile-time constant. Not an invariant at compile time.\n\n- if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n  - Depends on two runtime values (required_size and *ptmp2_size). Not invariant.\n\n- if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n  - Compares a runtime parameter to a constant; not necessarily invariant at compile time.\n\n- if (NULL != *ptmp2) and if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n  - Depend on the runtime pointer value; not invariant.\n\nNo controlling expression is a constant true/false literal or made constant by preceding control flow such that it can never change. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant further investigation for Rule 14.3."
