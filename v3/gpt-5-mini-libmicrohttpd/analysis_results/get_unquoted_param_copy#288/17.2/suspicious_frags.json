  "explanation": "Only code fragments that involve function calls or could hide function calls (assert macros) need investigation for potential direct or indirect recursion. The listed fragments cover all such invocations in this function: the mhd_assert calls, the call to get_buffer_for_size, the memcpy call, and the call to MHD_str_unquote. Other parts of the function are simple operations (assignments to struct members, integer/NULL comparisons, constant checks, return statements, and use of literals/macros) that do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion by themselves. Thus no additional fragments in this function need investigating for Rule 17.2 compliance."
