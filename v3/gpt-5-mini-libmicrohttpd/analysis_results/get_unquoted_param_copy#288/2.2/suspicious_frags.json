  "explanation": "Other lines in the function perform core operations whose removal would alter program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code: the call and assignment unquoted->str = get_buffer_for_size(...), the call to MHD_str_unquote(...), the assignment unquoted->len = MHD_str_unquote(...), and the final return _MHD_UNQ_OK are active data-flow and control-flow elements (allocation, copying/unquoting, length bookkeeping and returning the result). The comments are non-executable. The memcpy and its enclosing branch are included above because that branch may be unexecuted across all callers (potential dead code) and thus should be investigated. The asserted checks are included because assertions may be compiled out or have no side effects; they could therefore be executed but effectively removable without changing behaviour (or conversely be relied upon to enforce invariants) \u2014 both scenarios warrant inspection. The NULL-check + ternary return is included because the diagnostic selection based on param->value.len + 1 may duplicate logic already enforced elsewhere (or be unreachable), so it should be verified. No other statements in this function appear to be removable without changing observable behaviour and thus do not need further investigation for Rule 2.2 in this fragment."
