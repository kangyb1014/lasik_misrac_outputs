  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: function prototypes, enum return type, pointer and array parameters (the parameter 'char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE]' is an ordinary array declarator in a parameter list and decays to a pointer), standard library calls (memcpy), ternary operator, and macros/identifiers (mhd_assert, get_buffer_for_size, MHD_str_unquote) that are not language extensions themselves. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, __asm__, inline assembly, compiler-specific pragmas, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
