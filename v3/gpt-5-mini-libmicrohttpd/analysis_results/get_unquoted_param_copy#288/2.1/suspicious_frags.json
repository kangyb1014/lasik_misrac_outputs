  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could indicate unreachable code or impossible branches and therefore merit investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1: the initial precondition assertions (they may abort in some builds making following code unreachable), the allocation-failure return (the two distinct return-values in the ternary may be mutually exclusive given project limits), the explicit non-quoted branch (the comment suggests the value is quoted \u2014 this branch might be impossible in some contexts), and the unquote call plus its post-conditions (the assertions may be always true/false depending on MHD_str_unquote behaviour). Other code in the function (the assignment to unquoted->str via get_buffer_for_size and the final return of _MHD_UNQ_OK) are straightforward control-flow elements that are reachable given the surrounding checks and do not by themselves create statically unreachable code paths, so they do not need further investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
