  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no occurrences of common compiler-specific keywords or built-ins such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __inline__ (or other vendor-prefixed inline), statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions, or inline assembly.\n- The backslash shown is only a line-continuation in source (preprocessor behavior), not a language extension.\n- All casts are to standard types (e.g. (enum MHD_EpollState)), bitwise and logical operators are standard C, and function calls (epoll_ctl, XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, etc.) are ordinary calls \u2014 platform APIs or project macros, not compiler extensions.\n- Conditional compilation (#if defined(...)) and macro usage are standard preprocessor features, not compiler extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language/compiler extensions). If you want, I can re-check other translation units or included macros (e.g. implementations of XDLL_remove, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_PANIC, or any macros used here) because language extensions could be hidden inside those macro/function definitions; but within this function body itself no compiler-specific extensions are present."
