  "explanation": "No other constructs in the function represent compiler language extensions. The function uses standard C elements: static function scope, pointer and size_t types, NULL comparison, while loop, pointer arithmetic and indexing, and macros/identifiers prefixed with MHD_ which are project/library symbols (not compiler language extensions). The call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is a project/library function or macro, not a compiler language extension. There are no GNU or compiler-specific constructs (no typeof, statement expressions, inline assembler, __attribute__, asm, __extension__, or other compiler-only keywords) present in the shown code. Therefore only the use of strdup \u2014 a POSIX/non-standard C library function often documented as an extension \u2014 needs investigation."
