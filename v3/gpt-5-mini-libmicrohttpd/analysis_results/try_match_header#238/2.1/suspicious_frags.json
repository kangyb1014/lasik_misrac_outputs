  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in this function. Every statement and branch can be reached depending on runtime inputs: the initial if-return is conditional on *suffix and does not make subsequent code unreachable; the while loop executes only when line[0] != '\\0' (so it can be entered or skipped); the inner if may be true (causing an early return) or false (allowing ++line and further iterations); and the final return is reached when the loop completes without a match. There are no constant-false/constant-true conditions, no unconditional returns/gotos that skip later code, and no dead (unreachable) statements. (Note: there are other potential issues such as dereferencing suffix without checking that suffix itself is non-NULL, but that is a runtime/UB/safety concern, not an instance of unreachable code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.)"
