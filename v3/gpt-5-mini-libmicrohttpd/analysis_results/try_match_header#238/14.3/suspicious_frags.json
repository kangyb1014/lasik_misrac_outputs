  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. Details:\n- if (NULL != *suffix): the expression depends on the value pointed to by the suffix parameter (input-dependent), so it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n- while (0 != *line): the expression depends on the contents of the buffer pointed to by line; line is advanced (++line) inside the loop, so the condition can change and is not invariant. This is a normal string-termination loop, not an infinite loop constructed from an invariant expression.\n- if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_(...)): the result depends on runtime values (prefix, line, prefix_len) and thus is not invariant.\n- There are no for- or do-while loops with constant controlling expressions (e.g. for(;;), while(1), do { } while(0) etc.) that would trigger Rule 14.3 concerns or its exceptions.\nTherefore, no code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
