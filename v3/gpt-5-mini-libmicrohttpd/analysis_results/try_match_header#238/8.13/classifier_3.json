  "scenario": "The parameter 'line' is declared as 'char *' but is only read (not modified) and the call uses &line[prefix_len] as the source string for strdup. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. Here 'line' could and should be declared as 'const char *line', and the call would then pass a 'const char *' to strdup. As written, the non-const 'char *line' violates Rule 8.13."
