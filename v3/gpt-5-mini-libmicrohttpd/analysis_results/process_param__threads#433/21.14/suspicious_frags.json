  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function there is no use of memcmp or any string comparison operation: only fprintf, an assignment, a numeric zero check, and a call to get_param_value are present. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that violate or invoke the rule. Note: the implementation of get_param_value is not shown here; if it lives elsewhere it should be inspected for use of memcmp on null-terminated strings, but that code is outside the provided fragment and thus not listed as suspicious here."
