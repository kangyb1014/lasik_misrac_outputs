  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected in the provided function. Each conditional branch (checks of tool_params.all_cpus and tool_params.thread_per_conn) returns only when the corresponding runtime flag is true; if false execution continues, so those branches are not dead. The call to get_param_value may return an error (handled by an immediate return) or a success value, so the subsequent check for param_value == 0 and the assignment tool_params.threads = param_value are reachable when get_param_value succeeds. There are no statements present after an unconditional return, no mutually exclusive compile-time conditions, no unreachable labels/gotos, and no code that can never be executed regardless of runtime state. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 2.1 in this function."
