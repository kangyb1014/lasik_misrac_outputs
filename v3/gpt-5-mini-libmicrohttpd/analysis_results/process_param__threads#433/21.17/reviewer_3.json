A realistic violation: get_param_value uses functions like strcpy/strcat/strlen/memcpy and assumes param_tail is a NUL-terminated string or a sufficiently large buffer. If param_tail points to a substring not NUL-terminated (or points near the end of its buffer) or if next_param marks a boundary but is ignored, a call to strlen/strcpy/memcpy could read or write past the object bounds (buffer overread/overflow). Thus the call site can lead to a Rule 21.17 violation unless get_param_value explicitly bounds and validates the input strings.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The snippet of process_param__threads itself does not call any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 \u2014 it only passes three const char * arguments to get_param_value. Rule 21.17 prohibits uses of memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc. that access beyond object bounds. Whether a violation exists depends entirely on get_param_value\u2019s implementation (and on the API contract for param_name/param_tail/next_param). Without the code or a documented contract for get_param_value you cannot prove that any string.h function is used unsafely. Therefore the report as stated (that process_param__threads violates 21.17) is not correct. If get_param_value uses string.h functions and assumes NUL-terminated buffers when the callers can pass non-NUL-terminated substrings, then that implementation would violate 21.17 \u2014 so the real fix is to inspect/modify get_param_value or to document/validate the pointer preconditions at this call site."
