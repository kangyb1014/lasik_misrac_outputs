Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining lines (variable declarations, the function header, and the general structure of calling get_param_value and using its result) are typical, necessary operations that affect program behaviour and therefore are not likely dead. The call to get_param_value and the subsequent use of its result determine control flow and output; removing them would change behaviour. Likewise, the function signature, local variable declarations, and the final return are required for correct operation. The fragments listed above are highlighted because they contain branches, error-path prints/returns, or assignments that could be redundant or never exercised in some project configurations (and thus merit investigation for possible dead-code violations). No other code in the snippet appears to be an executed operation whose removal would be behaviour-preserving."
