  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appear in the provided function. The function performs only: bitwise and integer flag checks on response->flags_auto, response->flags, flags and response->total_size; enum comparisons; assignment to response->flags; and varargs reading of enum MHD_ResponseOptions via va_arg. There are no char* or null-terminated string variables, no string literal comparisons, and no function calls (other than the varargs macros) that could hide a direct memcmp call in this fragment. Therefore there are no code locations in this function that should be investigated for Rule 21.14."
