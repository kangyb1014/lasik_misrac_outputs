  "explanation": "I did not find any use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n\n- No GCC/Clang extension tokens or built-ins are present (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __inline__ style keywords, no __label__ or address-of-label, etc.).\n- No nested functions or statement-expression constructs (GCC's ({ ... })) are used.\n- No inline assembly, no use of nonstandard keywords, and no vendor-specific pragmas appear in the fragment.\n- Pointer arithmetic and the cast (char *)&pp[1] are standard C (pointer indexing and cast), not compiler extensions.\n- Macro-like identifiers (e.g. MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) are ordinary identifiers; their presence alone is not a language extension. Without their definitions in this fragment there is no evidence they expand to compiler-specific extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you can provide macro definitions or other surrounding code (headers, build-specific attributes), I can re-check those for extension usage."
