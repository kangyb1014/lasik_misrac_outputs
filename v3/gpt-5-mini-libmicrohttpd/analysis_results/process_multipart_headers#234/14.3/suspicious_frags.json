  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (constant) and therefore nothing that prima facie violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specific rationale:\n- The only loop in the function is\n  while ((newline < pp->buffer_pos) && (buf[newline] != '\\r') && (buf[newline] != '\\n')) newline++;\n  This condition depends on newline (which is incremented in the loop) and on runtime data (pp->buffer_pos and buf[]), so it is not invariant.\n- All if conditions (e.g. if (newline == pp->buffer_size), if (newline == pp->buffer_pos), if (0 == newline), if (buf[newline] == '\\r')) are evaluated against runtime values; none are compile-time constant/invariant controlling expressions.\n- There are no for- or do-while loops with constant controlling expressions, and no explicit infinite loops written as e.g. while(1).\n- Use of macros like MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ in calls is for indexing/passes to helper functions and does not create an invariant controlling expression.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
