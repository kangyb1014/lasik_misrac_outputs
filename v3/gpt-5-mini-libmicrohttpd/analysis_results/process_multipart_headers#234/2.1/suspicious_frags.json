  "explanation": "The listed fragments are points where control flow depends on relationships between 'newline', 'pp->buffer_pos' and 'pp->buffer_size' or where an early return is performed; these conditions may make other paths unreachable depending on invariants (and therefore should be investigated). Other parts of the function do not appear to contain unreachable code by simple local control-flow inspection: the header-processing path that sets pp->skip_rn for '\\r', null-terminates the buffer, and then performs the Content-disposition / Content-type checks (including the else branch and calls to try_get_value / try_match_header), as well as the final update of (*ioffptr) and return MHD_YES, are all reachable following the earlier checks and returns. No additional isolated returns or dead-code constructs are present elsewhere in this function that would warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
