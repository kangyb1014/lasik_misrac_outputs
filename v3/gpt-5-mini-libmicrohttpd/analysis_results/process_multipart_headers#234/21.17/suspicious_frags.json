  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not perform string handling or pointer-based buffer reads that could cause accesses beyond the bounds of the object. Specifically:\n- The loop exit and subsequent returns enforce that newline < pp->buffer_pos before code proceeds to treat buf as containing an accessible byte at index newline (so direct indexed accesses in the loop and the immediate checks are guarded by the buffer_pos condition).\n- The checks that compare newline against pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size and the early returns set state or return, preventing fall-through to string operations when the buffer does not contain a complete line.\n- Simple assignments to pp->skip_rn, pp->state, and the arithmetic update (*ioffptr) += newline + 1; are control/state updates and do not invoke any string-handling routine or access additional bytes beyond the already-validated index.\n- The comment-only and return lines do not involve any memory accesses beyond what is already validated.\n\nThe selected fragments include all locations where a buffer pointer (buf) or an index derived from it is passed to routines or used in a way that could cause string routines to read a specified number of bytes (e.g. calls that provide a static length or take a pointer into buf). These should be examined to ensure that any string.h based operations performed inside the called helpers (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_, try_get_value, try_match_header, and the code that they call) cannot read past the allocated object (&pp[1]) as described by pp->buffer_size."
