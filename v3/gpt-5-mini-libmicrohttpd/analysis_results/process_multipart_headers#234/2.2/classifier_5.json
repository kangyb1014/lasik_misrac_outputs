Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_multipart_headers:\n```c\nstatic int\nprocess_multipart_headers (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                           size_t *ioffptr,\n                           enum PP_State next_state)\n{\n  char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  size_t newline;\n\n  newline = 0;\n  while ( (newline < pp->buffer_pos) &&\n          (buf[newline] != '\\r') &&\n          (buf[newline] != '\\n') )\n    newline++;\n  if (newline == pp->buffer_size)\n  {\n    pp->state = PP_Error;\n    return MHD_NO;              /* out of memory */\n  }\n  if (newline == pp->buffer_pos)\n    return MHD_NO;              /* will need more data */\n  if (0 == newline)\n  {\n    /* empty line - end of headers */\n    pp->skip_rn = RN_Full;\n    pp->state = next_state;\n    return MHD_YES;\n  }\n  /* got an actual header */\n  if (buf[newline] == '\\r')\n    pp->skip_rn = RN_OptN;\n  buf[newline] = '\\0';\n  if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (\"Content-disposition: \",\n                                 buf,\n                                 MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")))\n  {\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"name\",\n                   &pp->content_name);\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"filename\",\n                   &pp->content_filename);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    try_match_header (\"Content-type: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-type: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_type);\n    try_match_header (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_transfer_encoding);\n  }\n  (*ioffptr) += newline + 1;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (newline == pp->buffer_size)\n  {\n    pp->state = PP_Error;\n    return MHD_NO;              /* out of memory */\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The branch is reachable when pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size and the buffer contains no '\\r' or '\\n' in the examined region (the while loop stops with newline == pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size). In that case the code sets pp->state = PP_Error and returns MHD_NO to signal an error/full buffer. Removing this branch would change program behaviour (error/state handling), so it is not dead code."
