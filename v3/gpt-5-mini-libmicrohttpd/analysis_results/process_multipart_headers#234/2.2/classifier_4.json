  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_multipart_headers:\n```c\nstatic int\nprocess_multipart_headers (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                           size_t *ioffptr,\n                           enum PP_State next_state)\n{\n  char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  size_t newline;\n\n  newline = 0;\n  while ( (newline < pp->buffer_pos) &&\n          (buf[newline] != '\\r') &&\n          (buf[newline] != '\\n') )\n    newline++;\n  if (newline == pp->buffer_size)\n  {\n    pp->state = PP_Error;\n    return MHD_NO;              /* out of memory */\n  }\n  if (newline == pp->buffer_pos)\n    return MHD_NO;              /* will need more data */\n  if (0 == newline)\n  {\n    /* empty line - end of headers */\n    pp->skip_rn = RN_Full;\n    pp->state = next_state;\n    return MHD_YES;\n  }\n  /* got an actual header */\n  if (buf[newline] == '\\r')\n    pp->skip_rn = RN_OptN;\n  buf[newline] = '\\0';\n  if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (\"Content-disposition: \",\n                                 buf,\n                                 MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")))\n  {\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"name\",\n                   &pp->content_name);\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"filename\",\n                   &pp->content_filename);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    try_match_header (\"Content-type: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-type: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_type);\n    try_match_header (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_transfer_encoding);\n  }\n  (*ioffptr) += newline + 1;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (\"Content-disposition: \",\n                                 buf,\n                                 MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")))\n  {\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"name\",\n                   &pp->content_name);\n    try_get_value (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-disposition: \")],\n                   \"filename\",\n                   &pp->content_filename);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    try_match_header (\"Content-type: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-type: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_type);\n    try_match_header (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \",\n                      MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: \"),\n                      buf,\n                      &pp->content_transfer_encoding);\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if/else selects different runtime actions (parsing Content-disposition vs other headers) that modify pp->content_name, pp->content_filename, pp->content_type, or pp->content_transfer_encoding. None of the statements are statically dead from this fragment alone. A violation would occur only in a specific situation not shown here \u2014 for example, if try_get_value and try_match_header were implemented as no-op stubs that never modify state (or their results are never used elsewhere), so calling them has no observable effect; in that hypothetical case those calls would be dead code."
