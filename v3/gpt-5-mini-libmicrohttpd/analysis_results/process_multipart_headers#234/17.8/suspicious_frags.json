  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is modified in this function. The code only modifies objects pointed to by pointer parameters (which is permitted by Rule 17.8): pp->skip_rn, pp->state, pp->content_name, pp->content_filename, pp->content_type, pp->content_transfer_encoding are member writes through the pp pointer (allowed); (*ioffptr) += newline + 1 increments the object pointed to by ioffptr (allowed). The pointer parameters themselves are not reassigned or changed (there is no assignment like pp = ..., ioffptr = ..., or next_state = ...). The local variable buf is a separate local pointer and not a function parameter; buf[newline] = '\n' modifies the pointed-to buffer (allowed). The expression (char *)&pp[1] performs an address computation but does not modify the pp parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
