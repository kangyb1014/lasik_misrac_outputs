  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function body contains only assignments of compile-time integer constants to structure members and simple integer initializations. There are no function calls (direct or indirect) within MHD_SHA512_256_init: UINT64_C is a standard integer-constant macro, not a function call, and there is no invocation through function pointers, callbacks, or other functions. Therefore there is no possibility of direct or indirect self-calling (recursion) in this code fragment and nothing needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
