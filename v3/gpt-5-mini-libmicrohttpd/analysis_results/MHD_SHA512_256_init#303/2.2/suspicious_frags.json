Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the code (function header, comments, braces and the descriptive comments about FIPS/IV generation) are non-executable or purely documentary and therefore cannot constitute dead executable operations. No other executable statements appear in the snippet beyond the assignments listed above. Those listed assignments are the only executed operations in this function and therefore are the only candidates that merit investigation to determine whether removing any of them would leave program behaviour unchanged (i.e. would constitute dead code)."
