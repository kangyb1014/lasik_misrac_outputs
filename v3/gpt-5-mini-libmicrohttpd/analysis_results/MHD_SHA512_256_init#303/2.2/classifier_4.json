Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_SHA512_256_init:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_SHA512_256_init (struct Sha512_256Ctx *ctx)\n{\n  /* Initial hash values, see FIPS PUB 180-4 clause 5.3.6.2 */\n  /* Values generated by \"IV Generation Function\" as described in\n   * clause 5.3.6 */\n  ctx->H[0] = UINT64_C (0x22312194FC2BF72C);\n  ctx->H[1] = UINT64_C (0x9F555FA3C84C64C2);\n  ctx->H[2] = UINT64_C (0x2393B86B6F53B151);\n  ctx->H[3] = UINT64_C (0x963877195940EABD);\n  ctx->H[4] = UINT64_C (0x96283EE2A88EFFE3);\n  ctx->H[5] = UINT64_C (0xBE5E1E2553863992);\n  ctx->H[6] = UINT64_C (0x2B0199FC2C85B8AA);\n  ctx->H[7] = UINT64_C (0x0EB72DDC81C52CA2);\n\n  /* Initialise number of bytes and high part of number of bits. */\n  ctx->count = 0;\n  ctx->count_bits_hi = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nctx->H[6] = UINT64_C (0x2B0199FC2C85B8AA);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment sets the initial SHA-512/256 chaining value (H[6]) and affects subsequent hashing operations; removing it would change program behaviour. (A violation would occur if that element were never read or were overwritten before any read \u2014 e.g. if the implementation only used H[0..5,7] or always wrote a new value to H[6] before any use, then this assignment would be dead code.)"
