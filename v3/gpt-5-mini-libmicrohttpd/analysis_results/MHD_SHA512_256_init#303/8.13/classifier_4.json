  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function intentionally takes a mutable pointer (struct Sha512_256Ctx *ctx) and assigns to a member to initialize the object; therefore the pointer must not be const. A violation would occur if the parameter were declared as const (e.g. const struct Sha512_256Ctx *ctx) while the code attempted ctx->count = 0 (which would attempt to modify an object through a pointer to const)."
