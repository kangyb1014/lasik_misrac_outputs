  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the provided function. Rationale: the only pointer parameters are\n- struct MHD_Connection *connection \u2014 this pointer is used to modify members (connection->stop_with_error, connection->discard_request) and is therefore correctly non-const; passing it to MHD_connection_close_ is consistent with a function that likely mutates the connection.\n- const char *emsg \u2014 this is already const-qualified, satisfying the rule. The (void) emsg cast and conditional logging do not remove const qualification. There is no evidence in this snippet of const being discarded (e.g., assigning a const-qualified pointer to a non-const pointer or passing a const pointer to a function parameter declared non-const). Therefore no fragments in this code need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
