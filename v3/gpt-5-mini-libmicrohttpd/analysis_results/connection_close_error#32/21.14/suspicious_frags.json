  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings. There is no call to memcmp (or any other byte-wise comparison function) in this code. The only operations involving the string pointer emsg are: a NULL check (if (NULL != emsg)), passing it to MHD_DLOG with a \"%s\" format specifier, and casting to (void) to suppress a compiler warning. These do not use memcmp and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. No other fragments in this function require investigation for this rule."
