Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not included because they are clearly functional and their removal would change program behaviour (they perform the actual connection close operation or are preprocessor/structural elements). In particular, the call that invokes the connection close implementation is an observable action that terminates the connection and thus is not dead code. The surrounding preprocessor directives and braces only control inclusion and structure and are not candidate dead-executable operations. No other statements in the snippet are plain no-ops or trivially removable without affecting runtime behaviour, so they do not need investigation under Rule 2.2."
