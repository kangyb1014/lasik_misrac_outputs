Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_close_error:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_close_error (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                        const char *emsg)\n{\n  connection->stop_with_error = true;\n  connection->discard_request = true;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (NULL != emsg)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              \"%s\\n\",\n              emsg);\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The fragment shown is only the function definition header for a static function. By itself this header does not contain any executed operation that would be classified as dead code. If the function were never called it would be unreachable (note 2) rather than dead code. However, in the full function body (not part of the fragment) the statement \u201c(void) emsg;\u201d (under #else /* ! HAVE_MESSAGES */) is a no\u2011op whose execution could be removed without changing program behaviour and therefore would meet the definition of dead code \u2014 that would be a violation when that version is compiled."
