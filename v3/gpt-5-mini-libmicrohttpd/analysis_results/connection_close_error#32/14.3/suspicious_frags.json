  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. Specifically:\n- There are no loops (for/while/do-while) whose controlling expressions could be constant; therefore the infinite-loop/do-while exceptions are irrelevant.\n- The preprocessor conditional (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) is not a C controlling expression subject to MISRA Rule 14.3; it conditionally compiles code but does not create an invariant runtime controlling expression.\n- The runtime conditional if (NULL != emsg) depends on the emsg parameter and is not an invariant expression.\n- Simple assignments (connection->stop_with_error = true; connection->discard_request = true;) and the function call MHD_connection_close_(...) are not controlling expressions.\n- The (void) emsg statement is only to suppress an unused-parameter warning and is not a controlling expression.\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
