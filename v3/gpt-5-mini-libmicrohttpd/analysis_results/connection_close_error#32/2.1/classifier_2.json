  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-statement\u2019s body is executed whenever emsg is non-NULL (and only compiled when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined), so it is reachable at runtime. The alternative branch for the case WHEN HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined is provided by the (void) emsg; line to avoid warnings. There is no code here that can never be executed under any possible build/runtime conditions, so Rule 2.1 is not violated."
