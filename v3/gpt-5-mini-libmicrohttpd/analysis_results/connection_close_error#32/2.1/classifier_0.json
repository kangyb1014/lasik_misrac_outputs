  "scenario": "The fragment uses conditional compilation (#ifdef/#else) so only one branch is present in any given build. Neither branch constitutes unreachable code in the compiled project; the (void) emsg; line is only compiled when HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined and the logging call is only compiled when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined. Therefore, as written this fragment does not introduce unreachable code. (A violation would occur only if there were code in the translation unit that is syntactically present but can never be executed at runtime, which is not the case here.)"
