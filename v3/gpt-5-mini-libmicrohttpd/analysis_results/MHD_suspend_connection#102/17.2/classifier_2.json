  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation found: the fragment MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) is a predicate/macros used in an assertion and does not call MHD_suspend_connection. There is no evidence in the provided code that this macro expands to a function which would (directly or indirectly) call MHD_suspend_connection. Rule 17.2 would only be violated if MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ expanded to code that (directly or indirectly) invoked MHD_suspend_connection, which is not shown here."
