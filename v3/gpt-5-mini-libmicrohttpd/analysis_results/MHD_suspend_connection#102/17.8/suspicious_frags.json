  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies the parameter variable 'connection' itself. The function only reads fields via 'connection->...', assigns one field value to a new local pointer 'daemon' (struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;), performs comparisons and calls helper/macros, and passes 'connection' to internal_suspend_connection_. Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter variable (e.g. reassigning 'connection' or incrementing it). There are no assignments to 'connection' nor uses that change the pointer value. Modifying the object pointed to (the struct contents) is permitted; internal_suspend_connection_ may alter the pointee, which is allowed by the rule. The macros used (mhd_assert, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG) do not take 'connection' as an lvalue in this code and therefore do not modify the parameter. Consequently, there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
