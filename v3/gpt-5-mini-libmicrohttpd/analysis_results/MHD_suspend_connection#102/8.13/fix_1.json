  "explanation": "The compiler error was caused by attempting to cast a struct value (daemon->tid) to an integer type for printing. You cannot cast a struct to unsigned long. I changed the log to print the address of the tid struct (\"%p\", (void *)&daemon->tid) which is safe and preserves useful debug info.\n\nAdditionally, to make the snippet compile standalone, I removed the leading macro qualifier from the function definition and added minimal type declarations and extern prototypes for the referenced types and functions (declarations only \u2014 no mock implementations). I also wrapped uses of the MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME bit in an #ifdef so compilation does not fail if that macro is not defined; in the undefined case the code behaves as if suspend/resume is not allowed (matching the original safety behavior). These changes preserve the original logic while fixing the invalid cast."
