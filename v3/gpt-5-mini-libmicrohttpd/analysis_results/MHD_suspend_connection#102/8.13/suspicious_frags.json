  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 for these reasons: \n- The preprocessor conditionals and macros (e.g. #ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS, MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_, MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_, MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_) are control constructs and do not themselves introduce pointer-to-non-const usages relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The assertion and logging calls (mhd_assert, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG) use existing identifiers/strings; they do not declare pointer variables whose pointed-to types could be const-qualified in this fragment.\n- Accesses to non-pointer members (for example daemon->tid used as an argument to a function) are not pointer declarations or pointer-to-object types that would be made const-qualified under Rule 8.13.\n- String literals and message text (the arguments to MHD_PANIC/MHD_DLOG) are not pointer declarations subject to this rule.\n- The conditional compilation markers (UPGRADE_SUPPORT, HAVE_MESSAGES) only enable/disable code regions; they do not change the pointer declarations that are relevant to Rule 8.13.\n\nThe selected fragments capture all places in this function where pointer parameters, pointer local variables, or pointer fields are used in a way that may merit adding a const qualifier to the pointed-to type; other code in the function either does not declare or pass pointer types that could be const-qualified or clearly requires mutable access."
