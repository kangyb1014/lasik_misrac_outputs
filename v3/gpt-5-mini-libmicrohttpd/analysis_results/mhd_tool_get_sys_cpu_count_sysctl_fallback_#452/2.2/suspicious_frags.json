  "explanation": "The following parts of the function are not reported for investigation because they do not appear to be candidates for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code):\n\n- The initialization \"int ret = -1;\" \u2014 this is an initialization (MISRA note 3) and may be relied upon by subsequent logic.\n- The calls to sysctlbyname(...) and sysctl(...) and their associated error-handling assignments (ret = -1) \u2014 these perform observable system calls and update state; removing them would change behavior.\n- The local declarations size_t value_size and int mib[2] and their uses \u2014 these are needed as arguments to the sysctl/sysctlbyname interfaces.\n- The comparisons involving value_size and sizeof(ret) \u2014 these check results returned by the sysctl interfaces and affect the assigned return value.\n- The final \"return ret;\" \u2014 returns the computed result and is clearly observable.\n- Comments and preprocessor conditionals used for portability feature detection \u2014 these are not executable code and the conditional compilation is intentional for platform-specific behavior.\n\nNo other obvious unreachable-code constructs are present in the snippet. The listed suspicious fragments should be investigated to confirm whether any executed code within them is redundant (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) under the project's build configurations."
