  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n  /* Do not use sysctl() function on GNU/Linux even if\n     sysctl() is available */\n#ifndef __linux__\n#ifdef HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    size_t value_size = sizeof (ret);\n    /* FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin (and others?): The number of CPUs */\n    if ((0 != sysctlbyname (\"hw.ncpu\", &ret, &value_size,\n                            NULL, 0))\n        || (sizeof (ret) != value_size))\n      ret = -1;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCTL) && \\\n  defined(HAS_DECL_CTL_HW) && \\\n  defined(HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU)\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    /* FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin (and others?): The number of CPUs */\n    int mib[2] = {CTL_HW, HW_NCPU};\n    size_t value_size = sizeof (ret);\n    if ((0 != sysctl (mib, 2, &ret, &value_size, NULL, 0))\n        || (sizeof (ret) != value_size))\n      ret = -1;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCTL && HAS_DECL_CTL_HW && HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU */\n#endif /* ! __linux__ */\n  if (0 >= ret)\n    return -1;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 >= ret)\n    return -1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if (0 >= ret) return -1; is not dead code: it affects the function result when ret is zero or negative. Removing it would change behavior (e.g. would return 0 when ret==0 instead of -1). Even though ret is initialized to -1 and may remain -1 in some build configurations, the conditional is needed for configurations where sysctl/sysctlbyname can set ret (including the possibility of ret==0), so the operation is not dead."
