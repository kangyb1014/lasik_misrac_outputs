  "explanation": "I flagged the two calls to external functions (sysctlbyname and sysctl) because indirect recursion could occur only via calls to other functions that might (directly or indirectly) call back into mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_. All other fragments in the function are simple/local constructs (variable declarations/initializations, comparisons, assignments, preprocessor conditionals, and return statements) that do not invoke other functions or use function pointers/callbacks and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect self-calls. There are no function-pointer invocations, no calls to macros that expand to function calls, and no other function-call sites in this code to investigate for recursion."
