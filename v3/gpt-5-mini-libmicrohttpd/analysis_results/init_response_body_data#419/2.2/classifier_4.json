The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of init_response_body_data:\n```c\nstatic int\ninit_response_body_data (void)\n{\n  if (0 != body_dyn_size)\n  {\n    body_dyn = (char *) malloc (body_dyn_size);\n    if (NULL == body_dyn)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\");\n      return 0;\n    }\n    if (tool_params.medium)\n    {\n      /* Fill the body with HTML-like content */\n      size_t pos;\n      size_t filler_pos;\n      static const char body_header[] =\n        \"<html>\\n\"\n        \"<head>\\n<title>Sample page title</title>\\n<head>\\n\"\n        \"<body>\\n\";\n      static const char body_filler[] =\n        \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.<br>\\n\";\n      static const char body_footer[] =\n        \"</body>\\n\"\n        \"</html>\\n\";\n      pos = 0;\n      memcpy (body_dyn + pos, body_header, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_header));\n      pos += MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_header);\n      for (filler_pos = 0;\n           filler_pos < (body_dyn_size - (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_header)\n                                          + MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_footer)));\n           ++filler_pos)\n      {\n        body_dyn[pos + filler_pos] =\n          body_filler[filler_pos % MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_filler)];\n      }\n      pos += filler_pos;\n      memcpy (body_dyn + pos, body_footer, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_footer));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      /* Fill the body with binary-like content */\n      size_t pos;\n      for (pos = 0; pos < body_dyn_size; ++pos)\n      {\n        body_dyn[pos] = (char) (unsigned char) (255U - pos % 256U);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (filler_pos = 0;\n           filler_pos < (body_dyn_size - (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_header)\n                                          + MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_footer)));\n           ++filler_pos)\n      {\n        body_dyn[pos + filler_pos] =\n          body_filler[filler_pos % MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (body_filler)];\n      }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The loop writes filler bytes into the dynamically allocated buffer body_dyn; removing these assignments would change program behaviour (the response body content). If the loop bounds evaluate to zero the body is simply not executed for that run (unreachable in that execution), which per MISRA Note 2 is not considered dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated by this fragment."
