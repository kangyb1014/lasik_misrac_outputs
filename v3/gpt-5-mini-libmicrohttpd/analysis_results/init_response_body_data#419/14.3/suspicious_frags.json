  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (loop and conditional expressions). The fragments listed above are all controlling expressions present in the function and therefore should be investigated for possible invariance. Other parts of the function (malloc, memcpy, fprintf, assignments, array indexing, constant string definitions, the return statement, and the modulo used for indexing the filler) are not controlling expressions and so are outside the scope of Rule 14.3; they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule. There are no do-while loops in the function (so the do-while exception does not apply)."
