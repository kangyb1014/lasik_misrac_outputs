Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && \\\n  (defined(HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU) || defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF))\n  long value = -1;\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_CRAY_NCPU);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU */\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF */\n  if (0 >= value)\n    return -1;\n  ret = (int) value;\n  if ((long) ret != value)\n    return -1; /* Overflow */\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF &&\n          (HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU || HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) */\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_CRAY_NCPU);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The guarded block is conditionally compiled when HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU is defined and performs a sysconf call that may change 'value' and thus the function's return on platforms that provide _SC_CRAY_NCPU. Removing it would change behavior on those platforms, so it is not dead code."
