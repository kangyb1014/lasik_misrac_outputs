  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function shows direct or indirect calls to ahc_echo. I searched all call sites inside ahc_echo: strcmp, strdup, strlen, can_compress, body_compress, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback, free, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response \u2014 none are ahc_echo, nor are any function pointers passed that reference ahc_echo. The req_cls state is only used to detect the request phase and is not used to invoke ahc_echo. There are no local or global function-pointer variables set to ahc_echo, and no callbacks in this snippet that could plausibly call back into ahc_echo. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
