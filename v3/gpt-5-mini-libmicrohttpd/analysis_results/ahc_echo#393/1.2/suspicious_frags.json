  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I searched for common extension markers (GCC/Clang/ICC attributes like __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, statement expressions, trailing comma in function parameters, asm volatile, anonymous structs/unions, extended integer types like __int128, and platform-specific keywords) and found none. The constructs present are standard C: (void) casts to silence unused-parameter warnings, enum and local variable declarations, function calls, and explicit casts (e.g. (void **) &body_str) which are plain C casts rather than compiler extensions. Note: strdup is a POSIX library function (not an ISO C language extension) and pointer-to-pointer casts are potentially risky for aliasing or type-safety but are not compiler language extensions per se. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
