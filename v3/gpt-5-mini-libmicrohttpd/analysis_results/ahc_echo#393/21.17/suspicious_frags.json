  "explanation": "Only the three fragments above call functions that originate from <string.h> (strcmp, strdup/strcpy-like behavior, and strlen) and therefore can potentially read past object bounds or require their pointer arguments to be valid, null-terminated strings. Other parts of the function do not call standard <string.h> routines (or only use non-string library APIs) and either perform proper NULL checks (e.g. checking strdup's return) or do not operate on C strings after possible transformation (e.g. the buffer may be compressed but no further string.h functions are used). Consequently, no other fragments in this function appear to risk out-of-bounds accesses from <string.h> functions and do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
