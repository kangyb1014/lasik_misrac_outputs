  "explanation": "The following pointer-bearing fragments in the function were NOT selected for investigation because they already meet (or clearly cannot meet) Rule 8.13 or are intentionally mutable:\n- const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data are already const-qualified and need no further inspection.\n- void **req_cls is intentionally written to (the function assigns to *req_cls), so the pointed-to type must be mutable; it should not be const.\n- struct MHD_Connection *connection is passed to library routines (can_compress, MHD_queue_response, MHD_add_response_header) that likely expect a mutable connection object; its non-constness is intentional.\n- char *body_str and related operations (strdup, body_compress called with (void**)&body_str, free via callback, and MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback) show that the buffer and pointer are managed and possibly reallocated/freed by called routines, so body_str must be a mutable pointer and is not a candidate for adding const.\n- struct MHD_Response *response and other response-manipulation variables are created/destroyed and passed to APIs that require mutable objects; they should remain non-const.\nTherefore only the unused parameter pointer(s) that are declared non-const (cls and upload_data_size) were flagged as suspicious and should be investigated to determine whether they could be declared pointing to const-qualified types."
