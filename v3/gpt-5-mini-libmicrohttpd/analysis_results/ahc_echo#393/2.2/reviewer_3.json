  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. The lines like \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d are the idiomatic cast-to-void used to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although such a statement executes and has no runtime effect, MISRA C\u2019s concern in Rule 2.2 is about true dead code that should not be present in a project. The cast-to-void is an explicit annotation of intent (and may be required to avoid spurious diagnostics); it is not the kind of unnecessary implemented operation that Rule 2.2 is intended to prohibit. In practice MISRA guidance and tool interpretations treat the \u201c(void)identifier;\u201d idiom for unused parameters as acceptable, not as a Rule 2.2 violation. Note: if the parameter were volatile or the expression had side effects, removal could affect behaviour, but that is not the case here."
