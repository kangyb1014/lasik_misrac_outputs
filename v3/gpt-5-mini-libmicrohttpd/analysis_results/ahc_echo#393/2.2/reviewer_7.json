  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is not correct. The statements like (void) url; are intentional references to otherwise-unused parameters to suppress compiler warnings and to document intent. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s observable behaviour; in practice MISRA guidance and common usage treat a deliberate cast-to-void for an unused parameter as an accepted way to mark the parameter \"used\" for diagnostics/documentation purposes and not as prohibited dead code. Even though removing the cast would not change runtime semantics, it can change diagnostics and the maintainability/intent of the code, so this pattern is not considered a Rule 2.2 violation in the usual MISRA interpretation. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
