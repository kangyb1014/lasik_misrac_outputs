  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void lines (e.g. (void) upload_data_size;) are no-op expressions at runtime, but they are an intentional idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code \u2014 operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 but the purpose of these casts is to affect build-time diagnostics/intent and to document that the parameter is intentionally unused. In practice MISRA guidance accepts explicit unused-parameter annotations (such as a (void)cast or a dedicated UNUSED macro) as the correct way to handle unused parameters. Therefore the claim that the single statement (void) upload_data_size; is a violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
