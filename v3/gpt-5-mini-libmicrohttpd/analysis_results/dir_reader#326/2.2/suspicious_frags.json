  "explanation": "Other code fragments should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 (dead code) because they perform observable actions or affect program behaviour: - DIR *dir = cls; and the declarations are necessary to access runtime data and are not mere no-op operations. - The do/while loop calling readdir (e = readdir (dir); ... while (e->d_name[0] == '.');) has side effects (advances directory stream) and its removal would change behaviour. - The snprintf call (res = snprintf(...)) writes formatted output into the provided buffer; removing it would obviously change behaviour. - The check if (max < (size_t) res) ensures buffer/truncation handling; it affects return codes and thus behaviour. - The final return (ssize_t) res; returns the number of bytes to the caller and is essential. - The NULL-check (if (e == NULL) return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;) is a runtime exit condition and not dead. The three fragments reported are the only statements that are candidates for being operations executed but having no effect on program behaviour (the void-cast used to suppress an unused-parameter warning, an apparently redundant size threshold early return, and the explicit snprintf error check which may be redundant in practice). All other statements have observable effects or govern control flow and therefore are not likely to be dead code under Rule 2.2."
