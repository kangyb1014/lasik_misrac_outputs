  "scenario": "No unreachable code is present in the shown fragment. The snprintf call is reachable whenever readdir() returns a non-NULL entry that does not start with '.', and the subsequent checks (res <= 0 and max < (size_t)res) are valid runtime checks for encoding error or truncation. There is no program path that makes that snprintf invocation or the following checks impossible in all executions. (Note: the truncation check could be provably unreachable on some platforms if you assume a strict, small upper bound on d_name length, but such an assumption is platform-specific and not guaranteed by the C/POSIX interfaces, so it does not make the code unreachable in general.)"
