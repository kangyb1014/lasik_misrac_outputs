  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The do/while body is reachable: each loop iteration assigns e = readdir(dir) and returns if e == NULL; otherwise the while condition checks e->d_name[0] == '.' so the loop exits when a non-dot entry is found and execution continues after the loop. There is no statement in this fragment that can never be executed. (A hypothetical violation would require code that is provably impossible to reach for all program executions\u2014for example if an unconditional return were placed before some statements, making them never reachable; that is not the case here.)"
