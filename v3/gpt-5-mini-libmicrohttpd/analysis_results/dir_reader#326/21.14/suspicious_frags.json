  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code fragment. The rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In this function: (1) there is no call to memcmp or any obvious memcmp-equivalent (bcmp, custom byte-wise comparisons) or strncmp; (2) string data (e->d_name) is passed to snprintf with %s, which is a correct string-handling function, not memcmp; (3) the only character comparison is e->d_name[0] == '.', which checks a single character, not a null-terminated string comparison with memcmp; and (4) all other comparisons are numeric (res checks and size comparisons). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this snippet."
