  "explanation": "I examined all function parameters: cls (void *), pos (uint64_t), buf (char *), and max (size_t). There are no statements that assign to any of these parameter variables (no occurrences of cls = ..., pos = ..., buf = ..., or max = ...). The only pointer-to-object operations are: assigning the parameter value to a local pointer (DIR *dir = cls;), calling readdir(dir) which may modify the DIR object referred to by cls, and calling snprintf(buf, ...) which writes to the object pointed to by buf. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted, but modifying the pointer parameter itself is not. The local assignment DIR *dir = cls does not modify the parameter; it merely copies its value. The explicit discard (void) pos; does not modify pos. Therefore no code fragments modify function parameters themselves and no further investigation under Rule 17.8 is required."
