  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the cls pointer is converted to DIR * and passed to readdir(), which modifies the DIR stream state, and buf is written to via snprintf. Therefore neither pointer can be const-qualified here. (A violation would occur if a pointer parameter were only read and never used to modify the pointee \u2014 e.g. a purely input-only generic pointer declared as void * instead of const void *.)"
