  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The code passes e->d_name (a char array member of struct dirent) directly to snprintf and does not declare any pointer that could/should be const. buf must be a non-const char* because it is written to. e->d_name is provided as an rvalue expression (char[] \u2192 char*) and is not modified here. Thus Rule 8.13 is not violated. (If the code had introduced a pointer variable to refer to d_name, that pointer should be declared const char * if it is not used to modify the data.)"
