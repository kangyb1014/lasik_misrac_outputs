  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The variable 'e' is declared as 'struct dirent *e;' but in the shown code it is only used for read-only access (e->d_name) and not modified. It could be declared as 'const struct dirent *e;' (assignment from readdir() returning 'struct dirent *' is compatible with a 'const struct dirent *' target). Therefore Rule 8.13 is violated because the pointer is not const-qualified when it could be."
