  "explanation": "The only pointer in this fragment is the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c' and its uses when passed to other functions; these should be investigated to determine whether 'c' could point to a const-qualified type. Other tokens do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: 'unsigned int err_code' is not a pointer; the NULL literal passed is not a declared pointer variable that can be const-qualified here; the error-message macro is presumably a string literal (already const) or otherwise not a local pointer declaration; no other pointer declarations or pointer-like variables appear in the provided code fragment."
