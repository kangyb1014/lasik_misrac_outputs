  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains no direct uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn calls, no string pointer arithmetic, and no buffer writes). The local declaration \"unsigned int err_code;\" and the function signature \"static void handle_req_cookie_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c)\" are not themselves related to string handling or buffer accesses and thus do not need investigation for this rule. The two function calls shown are flagged because they may internally use string.h functions or perform buffer accesses (in particular get_no_space_err_status_code is invoked with a NULL pointer and size 0, and transmit_error_response_static is passed a message identifier/literal), so those internal implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not access beyond object bounds. No other fragments in this code sample appear relevant to Rule 21.17."
