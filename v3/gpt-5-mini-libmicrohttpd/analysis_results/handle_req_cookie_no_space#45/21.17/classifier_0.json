  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The call only passes a pointer to a string literal (ERR_MSG_REQUEST_HEADER_WITH_COOKIES_TOO_BIG) to transmit_error_response_static; there is no direct use of functions from <string.h> here and no evidence of out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. (A potential violation would occur if transmit_error_response_static internally used e.g. strcpy/strcat/memcpy to copy this string into a destination buffer that is smaller than the string length, causing a buffer overflow, but that is not visible in the provided code fragment.)"
