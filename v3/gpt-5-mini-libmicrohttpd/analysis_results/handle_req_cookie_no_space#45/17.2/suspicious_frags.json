  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call in handle_req_cookie_no_space (the function body does not call handle_req_cookie_no_space). The declaration/definition line and the local variable declaration are not relevant to Rule 17.2. The only possible indirect-recursion concerns arise from the two function calls above: get_no_space_err_status_code and transmit_error_response_static. Their implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call handle_req_cookie_no_space or form a recursion cycle with each other or other functions. Other fragments in this function (the local variable err_code, the braces, and the macro token MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE used as an argument) do not by themselves create recursion and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
