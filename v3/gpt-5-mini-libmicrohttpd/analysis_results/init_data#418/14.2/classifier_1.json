  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of init_data:\n```c\nstatic int\ninit_data (void)\n{\n  unsigned int i;\n\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n    body_dyn_size = 8U * 1024U;\n  else if (tool_params.large)\n    body_dyn_size = 1024U * 1024U;\n  else\n    body_dyn_size = 0;\n\n  if (! init_response_body_data ())\n    return 25;\n\n  if (tool_params.unique)\n    return 0; /* Responses are generated on-fly */\n\n  if (tool_params.single)\n  {\n    resp_single = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resp_single)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create response.\\n\");\n      return 25;\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  /* Use more responses to minimise waiting in threads while the response\n     used by other thread. */\n  if (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    num_resps = 16 * get_num_threads ();\n  else\n    num_resps = 16 * get_cpu_core_count ();\n\n  resps = (struct MHD_Response **)\n          malloc ((sizeof(struct MHD_Response *)) * num_resps);\n  if (NULL == resps)\n  {\n    if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    {\n      free (body_dyn);\n      body_dyn = NULL;\n    }\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\");\n    return 25;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)\n  {\n    resps[i] = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resps[i])\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create responses.\\n\");\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (i == num_resps)\n    return 0; /* Success */\n\n  /* Cleanup */\n  while (--i < num_resps)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n  free (resps);\n  resps = NULL;\n  num_resps = 0;\n  if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    free (body_dyn);\n  body_dyn = NULL;\n  return 32;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (--i < num_resps)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies to for statements only. The fragment is a while loop: \"while (--i < num_resps) MHD_destroy_response(resps[i]);\" so Rule 14.2 is not applicable and therefore not violated. Note: the code does have a safety concern unrelated to Rule 14.2 \u2014 pre-decrementing an unsigned i in the loop condition can wrap when i == 0, producing a very large index and an out-of-bounds access to resps[i]; consider rewriting (for example, a clearly bounded for loop or testing i > 0 before decrement) to avoid that runtime hazard."
