  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of init_data:\n```c\nstatic int\ninit_data (void)\n{\n  unsigned int i;\n\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n    body_dyn_size = 8U * 1024U;\n  else if (tool_params.large)\n    body_dyn_size = 1024U * 1024U;\n  else\n    body_dyn_size = 0;\n\n  if (! init_response_body_data ())\n    return 25;\n\n  if (tool_params.unique)\n    return 0; /* Responses are generated on-fly */\n\n  if (tool_params.single)\n  {\n    resp_single = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resp_single)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create response.\\n\");\n      return 25;\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  /* Use more responses to minimise waiting in threads while the response\n     used by other thread. */\n  if (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    num_resps = 16 * get_num_threads ();\n  else\n    num_resps = 16 * get_cpu_core_count ();\n\n  resps = (struct MHD_Response **)\n          malloc ((sizeof(struct MHD_Response *)) * num_resps);\n  if (NULL == resps)\n  {\n    if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    {\n      free (body_dyn);\n      body_dyn = NULL;\n    }\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\");\n    return 25;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)\n  {\n    resps[i] = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resps[i])\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create responses.\\n\");\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (i == num_resps)\n    return 0; /* Success */\n\n  /* Cleanup */\n  while (--i < num_resps)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n  free (resps);\n  resps = NULL;\n  num_resps = 0;\n  if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    free (body_dyn);\n  body_dyn = NULL;\n  return 32;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nunsigned int i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The declaration 'unsigned int i;' itself does not breach Rule 14.2. In the for loop (for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)) the first clause sets the loop counter, the second clause uses only the loop counter (and num_resps, which is not modified in the loop body), and the third clause modifies only the loop counter. There is only one loop counter and it is not modified in the loop body, so the for loop is well\u2011formed."
