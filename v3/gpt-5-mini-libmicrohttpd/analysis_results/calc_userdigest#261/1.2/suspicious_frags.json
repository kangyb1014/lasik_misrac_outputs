  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses standard C constructs (function definition syntax, parameter types like size_t and uint8_t from the C standard, struct pointer, const qualifiers, normal function calls and identifiers) and contains no explicit compiler-specific keywords or extension syntax such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, pragma with vendor tokens, inline assembler, or other documented compiler extensions. Identifiers and function names with leading underscores or underscores in names are not by themselves compiler extensions. Therefore only the two fragments above should be investigated further: _MHD_static_inline is a macro-like token that commonly expands to compiler-dependent inline/visibility/attribute qualifiers, and mhd_assert could expand to a compiler-specific assertion/diagnostic macro \u2014 both may hide compiler-specific extensions and should be checked in their definitions. No other code fragments in the shown function appear to use language/compiler extensions."
