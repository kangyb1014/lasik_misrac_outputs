  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userdigest:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userdigest (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                 const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n                 const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n                 const char *password,\n                 uint8_t *ha1_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update_str (da, password);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, ha1_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call digest_update(da, realm, realm_len) contributes the realm bytes to the hash calculation; removing it would change the resulting ha1_bin and thus program behaviour. It would only be dead code in a hypothetical situation where realm_len is provably always zero (and digest_update has no side\u2011effects for zero length) for all program executions, which is not demonstrated here."
