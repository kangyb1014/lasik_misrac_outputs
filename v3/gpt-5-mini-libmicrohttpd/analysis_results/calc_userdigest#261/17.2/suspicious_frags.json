  "explanation": "Indirect recursion can only occur via function calls. The only statements in this function that invoke other routines are the call expressions listed above, so each of those call sites must be inspected to determine whether they call (directly or indirectly) calc_userdigest. Other parts of the code (function signature, parameter declarations, braces, and non-call expressions) cannot introduce a call path back to calc_userdigest and therefore do not need to be investigated. Note that there is no explicit self-call to calc_userdigest in the function body; all potential recursion sources are the listed calls (including the two repeated calls to digest_update_with_colon and digest_update)."
