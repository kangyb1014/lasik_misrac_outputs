  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: a static function definition, standard parameter list (void), string literals, a macro identifier (REALM) which is a standard preprocessor feature, the logical-not operator (! 0) which is standard C and simply evaluates to 1, and return statements. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, inline asm, nested functions, statement expressions, variable length arrays (in a context that would be an extension), designated initializers with extension syntax, or compiler-specific pragmas. The only potentially unusual token sequence is \"! 0\" but that is standard C (logical negation of zero yields 1) and not a compiler extension. If the REALM macro expands to compiler-specific constructs, that expansion would need separate review, but as written the identifier itself is a standard preprocessor usage and does not constitute a language extension in the code shown."
