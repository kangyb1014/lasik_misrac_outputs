  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains no parameters to be modified: add_new_users has no parameters, so Rule 17.8 cannot be violated within this function body itself. The return statements and the boolean/constant expressions (e.g. ! 0, 0) do not involve modifying function parameters. The only places that can potentially violate Rule 17.8 are the calls to add_new_user_entry because that callee\u2019s parameter handling is unknown; therefore those call sites are the relevant fragments for investigation. No other fragments in the provided code need investigation for Rule 17.8."
