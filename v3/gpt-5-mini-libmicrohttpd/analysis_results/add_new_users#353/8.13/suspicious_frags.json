  "explanation": "Only the two calls to add_new_user_entry need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they pass string literals (and the REALM macro) as arguments that are pointers to character data. The rest of the function contains no other pointer usage: the function signature (static int add_new_users(void)) has no pointer parameters, the return statements and boolean expressions (!0, 0) are integer/boolean operations and not relevant to pointer const-qualification, and there are no other variables or pointer expressions in this snippet. Investigators should therefore focus on the two shown call sites (and the prototype/definition of add_new_user_entry) to determine whether the parameters should be const-qualified."
