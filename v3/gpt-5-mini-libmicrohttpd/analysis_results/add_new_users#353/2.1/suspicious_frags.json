  "explanation": "Only those conditional-return points and the final return need investigation with respect to unreachable code. The if-statements perform returns based on the result of add_new_user_entry; whether the subsequent code is reachable depends on the actual definition/behavior of add_new_user_entry and any macros it uses (and possibly REALM). The remainder of the function (the function header, string literals, parameter ordering and use of the logical-not on 0 as an argument) does not by itself introduce unreachable code and therefore does not require investigation for Rule 2.1. No other unconditional returns, infinite loops, or obviously dead-code constructs are present in this snippet."
