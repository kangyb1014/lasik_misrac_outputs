Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of recv_param_adapter:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nrecv_param_adapter (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                    void *other,\n                    size_t i)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n\n  if ( (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET == connection->socket_fd) ||\n       (MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED == connection->state) )\n  {\n    return MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_;\n  }\n  if (i > MHD_SCKT_SEND_MAX_SIZE_)\n    i = MHD_SCKT_SEND_MAX_SIZE_; /* return value limit */\n\n  ret = MHD_recv_ (connection->socket_fd,\n                   other,\n                   i);\n  if (0 > ret)\n  {\n    const int err = MHD_socket_get_error_ ();\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_EAGAIN_ (err))\n    {\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n      /* Got EAGAIN --- no longer read-ready */\n      connection->epoll_state &=\n        ~((enum MHD_EpollState) MHD_EPOLL_STATE_READ_READY);\n#endif /* EPOLL_SUPPORT */\n      return MHD_ERR_AGAIN_;\n    }\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_EINTR_ (err))\n      return MHD_ERR_AGAIN_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_REMOTE_DISCNN_ (err))\n      return MHD_ERR_CONNRESET_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_ (err, MHD_SCKT_EOPNOTSUPP_))\n      return MHD_ERR_OPNOTSUPP_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_ (err, MHD_SCKT_ENOTCONN_))\n      return MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_ (err, MHD_SCKT_EINVAL_))\n      return MHD_ERR_INVAL_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_LOW_RESOURCES_ (err))\n      return MHD_ERR_NOMEM_;\n    if (MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_ (err, MHD_SCKT_EBADF_))\n      return MHD_ERR_BADF_;\n    /* Treat any other error as a hard error. */\n    return MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_;\n  }\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  else if (i > (size_t) ret)\n    connection->epoll_state &=\n      ~((enum MHD_EpollState) MHD_EPOLL_STATE_READ_READY);\n#endif /* EPOLL_SUPPORT */\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n      /* Got EAGAIN --- no longer read-ready */\n      connection->epoll_state &=\n        ~((enum MHD_EpollState) MHD_EPOLL_STATE_READ_READY);\n#endif /* EPOLL_SUPPORT */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the operation clears the connection->epoll_state READ_READY flag when EAGAIN is detected. This side effect can change runtime behaviour (how the connection is treated by the epoll-based event loop) and is reachable when MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_EAGAIN_() is true. When EPOLL_SUPPORT is not defined the code is removed by the preprocessor (not considered dead code). Note: this fragment would only constitute dead code (and thus violate Rule 2.2) if, in the build where EPOLL_SUPPORT is defined, the epoll_state field is never read/used anywhere else in the program so that removing the write would have no effect on behaviour."
