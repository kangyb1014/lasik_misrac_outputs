  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that should be const-qualified when possible. The remaining fragments in the function do not need investigation: chunk_size_line is already declared as const char *; semicol is declared const char *; the local err_code is not a pointer; the string literals used as error messages are inherently constant. The memchr call itself is acceptable as written (its result is assigned to a const char *), so only the non-const connection pointer and the places where pointers are passed to external functions (which may accept non-const parameters) warrant inspection to verify whether their parameter types should be const-qualified."
