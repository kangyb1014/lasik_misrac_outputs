  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- chunk_size_line is declared as const char * and is only read (passed to memchr and to get_no_space_err_status_code); it is never assigned to or otherwise changed within this function.\n- chunk_size_line_size is a value parameter (size_t) and is only read; it is not assigned to or altered.\n- c (struct MHD_Connection *) is only passed as an argument to other functions; the pointer variable itself is not reassigned or modified.\n- semicol is a local pointer (const char *) receiving the result of memchr; that is a local variable, not a parameter.\nBecause there are no assignments, increments, or reassignments of the parameter variables in this code fragment, there are no places that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 within the provided function body."
