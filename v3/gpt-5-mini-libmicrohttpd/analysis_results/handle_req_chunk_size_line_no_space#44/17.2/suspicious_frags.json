  "explanation": "Only calls to other (non-library) functions can introduce indirect recursion. In this function the only non-library function calls are the three calls listed above: two calls to transmit_error_response_static and one call to get_no_space_err_status_code. These call sites must be investigated to determine whether those functions (directly or indirectly) call handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, which would violate Rule 17.2. Other fragments in the function (variable declarations, the memchr call, pointer checks, assignments, comments, and the function header) do not invoke user-defined functions that could produce recursion: memchr is a standard library routine and will not call back into this static function, and there are no other function calls present. Therefore they do not need investigation for recursion."
