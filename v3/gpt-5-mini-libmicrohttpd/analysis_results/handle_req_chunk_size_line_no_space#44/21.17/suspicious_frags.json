  "explanation": "No other calls to the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C Rule 21.17 appear in this function. The remaining statements are control flow, NULL-checks, variable declarations, and calls to helper functions (transmit_error_response_static) that are not direct uses of the standard <string.h> API in this snippet. The initial NULL check guards the memchr call entry point; other lines do not invoke memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn or memchr besides the fragment already reported. Therefore only the reported fragments need investigation to ensure that the pointer and size parameters do not permit out-of-bounds access (including checking the implementation of get_no_space_err_status_code, which receives the same pointer/size)."
