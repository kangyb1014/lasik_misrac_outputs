  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_hex_to_bin:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_hex_to_bin (const char *hex,\n                size_t len,\n                void *bin)\n{\n  uint8_t *const out = (uint8_t *) bin;\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  if (0 == len)\n    return 0;\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n  if (0 != len % 2)\n  {\n    /* Assume the first byte is encoded with single digit */\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if (0 > l)\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l);\n  }\n  while (r < len)\n  {\n    const int h = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if ((0 > h) || (0 > l))\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ( ((uint8_t) (((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) h)) << 4))\n                           | ((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l)) );\n  }\n  mhd_assert (len == r);\n  mhd_assert ((len + 1) / 2 == w);\n  return w;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ( ((uint8_t) (((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) h)) << 4))\n                           | ((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l)) );\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement performs the byte construction and stores it into out[w++] (including the side\u2011effect w++). Removing the assignment or the shift would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. Although some casts are redundant and could be simplified, redundancy does not make the executed operations dead under Rule 2.2."
