  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not established by the code shown. Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the two mhd_assert calls are dead depends entirely on how mhd_assert is implemented and compiled in the project:\n\n- If mhd_assert expands to nothing (e.g. disabled at compile time) then those calls are not executed at all, so they are not \"dead code\" (they are simply absent in the produced program). Unreachable/removed code is not what Rule 2.2 targets.  \n- If mhd_assert executes and performs observable actions (logging, printing, aborting, setting diagnostics, etc.) or if the asserted expressions have side effects, then removal would change behaviour and the calls are not dead.  \n- Only if mhd_assert is executed at run time and truly has no effect on program state or outputs (and the asserted expressions have no side effects) would those calls meet the definition of dead code and therefore violate Rule 2.2.\n\nThe agent A's scenario describes a possible configuration in which the calls would be dead, but the code alone does not prove that configuration applies. To determine a real MISRA 2.2 violation you must inspect how mhd_assert is implemented and how it is compiled (enabled/disabled) in the build.\n\nConclusion: the report as stated is not correct as a definite violation \u2014 it is conditional and cannot be confirmed from the supplied code and logs alone."
