  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp (or other standard library string-comparison functions such as strcmp, strncmp, bcmp, or strcasecmp) in the provided MHD_hex_to_bin implementation. The function only calls toxdigitvalue (to parse individual hex digits) and mhd_assert, performs integer arithmetic and byte writes; there are no calls to the C standard library comparison functions nor any obvious indirect calls (function pointers) that would perform a memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If toxdigitvalue or mhd_assert are implemented elsewhere, those implementations would need to be checked separately for memcmp usage, but they are not part of the supplied code fragment and thus do not constitute suspicious fragments here."
