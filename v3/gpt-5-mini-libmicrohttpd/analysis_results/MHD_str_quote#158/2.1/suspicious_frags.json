  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can produce unreachable or tautological control flow once preprocessing or integer arithmetic is considered: the compile-time controlled alternative for MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE (the #else / if (1) sequence), the fast-path condition that uses a multiplication (unquoted_len * 2) which may overflow or make one branch never taken, and the early-return size checks that could render subsequent code paths unreachable. Other portions of the function (the while loops, character handling, result[w++] assignments, and the mhd_assert lines) are runtime-dependent and not obviously statically unreachable: their execution depends on the values of unquoted_len, r and w at runtime, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1. Preprocessor-controlled mutual exclusion means only the selected preprocessor-controlled fragments can create compile-time unreachable code and thus were included."
