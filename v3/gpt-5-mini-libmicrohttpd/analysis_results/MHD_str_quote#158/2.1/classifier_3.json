  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: both branches are reachable depending on runtime values. For example, with unquoted_len=3 and buf_size=10 the condition (3*2 <= 10) is true and the fast path is taken; with unquoted_len=6 and buf_size=10 the condition is false and the slower path is taken. (Note: unquoted_len and buf_size are size_t (unsigned), so multiplication wraps modulo arithmetic if extremely large, which may change which branch is taken, but that is not an instance of unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.)"
