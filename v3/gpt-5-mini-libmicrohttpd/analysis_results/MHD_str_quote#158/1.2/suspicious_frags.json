  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: size_t, const, char literals (including escaped characters), array indexing with post-increment, standard preprocessor conditionals (#ifndef / #else / #endif), and ordinary control flow and assignments. There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as identifiers beginning with double underscores (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, __inline__ (nonstandard spelling), etc.). The macros referenced (MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE, mhd_assert) are ordinary identifiers; their expansions are not shown here, so they cannot be judged as language extensions from this fragment alone. Therefore no code fragments in this function need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 based on the visible source."
