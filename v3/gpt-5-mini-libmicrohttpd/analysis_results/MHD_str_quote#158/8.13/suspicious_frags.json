  "explanation": "I examined all pointer declarations and uses in the function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters are:\n- const char *unquoted \u2014 already const-qualified and only read from (correct for the rule);\n- char *result \u2014 written to (result[w++] = ...), so it must be a non-const pointer and cannot be const-qualified.\nThere are no other pointer variables, no pointer casts, and no pointer parameters passed to helper macros/functions in the shown code. The local variable const char chr is not a pointer. Because every pointer in the code is either correctly const-qualified (unquoted) or necessarily non-const due to being modified (result), there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 8.13."
