  "explanation": "I inspected the provided MHD_pool_allocate function and found no calls to memcmp or any other string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp). The code only performs pointer arithmetic, size checks, asserts, alignment macros (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE) and a memory-unpoisoning macro (_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY). There is no operation that treats data as null-terminated strings or compares buffers as strings. Consequently, there are no fragments in this snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14.\n\nNote: The snippet does reference macros whose definitions are not included here; however, within the visible code there is no evidence of memcmp usage or string comparisons to investigate further."
