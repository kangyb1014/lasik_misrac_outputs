  "explanation": "I did not include the mhd_assert lines, the variable declarations (void *ret; size_t asize;), or the final \"return ret;\" as suspicious because they do not themselves perform memory accesses or string.h operations: the asserts are diagnostics that check invariants, the declarations allocate no memory, and the return simply returns the computed pointer. The selected fragments are all places where buffer offsets, sizes, or a memory-touching macro are computed or applied and therefore need inspection to ensure any string.h (or similar) operations do not access beyond the referenced object bounds."
