Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_allocate:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_allocate (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                   size_t size,\n                   bool from_end)\n{\n  void *ret;\n  size_t asize;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n  if ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n    return NULL; /* size too close to SIZE_MAX */\n  if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n    return NULL;\n  if (from_end)\n  {\n    ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize];\n    pool->end -= asize;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    ret = &pool->memory[pool->pos];\n    pool->pos += asize;\n  }\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (ret, size);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n    return NULL; /* size too close to SIZE_MAX */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-check detects an overflow/wrap of the computed aligned size: when ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(size) yields 0 while size != 0 (e.g. size very close to SIZE_MAX), the function must return NULL. Removing this return would change program behaviour for those inputs (it would allow an invalid allocation and likely cause out-of-bounds accesses), so the code is not dead."
