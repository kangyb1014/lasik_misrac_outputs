  "explanation": "I found no explicit compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. In particular:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other well-known vendor extensions.\n- The use of bool and size_t are standard C types (stdbool.h and stddef.h / stdint.h) and are not compiler extensions.\n- Pointer arithmetic (&pool->memory[...]), struct usage, return of void*, and the control flow are all standard C constructs.\n- Macros and identifiers (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, mhd_assert, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) are user-defined in this code snippet; none show an explicit compiler extension. If any of those macros expand to compiler-specific intrinsics or extensions, that expansion would need to be provided to justify reporting \u2014 the rule only requires reporting when an extension is explicitly used (per compiler documentation).\n- The use of a leading underscore in _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is a naming/reserved-identifier concern, not by itself proof of a language extension.\n\nIf you can supply the definitions/expansions of the macros (especially _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and ROUND_TO_ALIGN*), I can re-check for any hidden compiler-specific extensions."
