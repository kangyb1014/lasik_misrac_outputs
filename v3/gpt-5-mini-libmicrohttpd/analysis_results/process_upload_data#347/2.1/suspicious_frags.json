  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function for statically unreachable code. No code fragment is obviously unreachable in the shown source: all return statements are reached only conditionally, and there is no code following an unconditional return in the same control flow that would be dead. The preprocessor conditional blocks (#ifdef WINDOWS / #if !defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) are compile-time choices and do not introduce unconditional dead code in the source as presented \u2014 only one branch will be compiled for a given target, which is expected. There are no unused labels, no switch/case fall-through mistakes, no infinite loops with code following them, and no statements that are never executed due to constant Boolean expressions in this snippet. All branches (category, language, other keys, missing filename, missing form data, file creation path, error handling for open/write) are reachable depending on runtime inputs and system state. Therefore, I do not identify any fragments that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want, I can re-check with a specific target platform (Windows vs POSIX) or known constant inputs that might make some branches impossible in your project configuration."
