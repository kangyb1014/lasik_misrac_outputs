  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe conditional 'if (1)' wrapping the block is a constant-true test. The condition is evaluated and the branch is always taken, so the presence of the 'if (1)' statement (its test and branching) is executed but removing it would not affect program behaviour. Thus the conditional is dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The body statements are not dead \u2014 they have effect \u2014 but the surrounding 'if (1)' construct is redundant and constitutes dead code.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_MD5_finish code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2942.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_MD5_finish as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_MD5_finish:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_MD5_finish (struct Md5Ctx *ctx,\n                uint8_t digest[MD5_DIGEST_SIZE])\n{\n  uint64_t num_bits;   /**< Number of processed bits */\n  unsigned int bytes_have; /**< Number of bytes in the context buffer */\n\n  /* Memorise the number of processed bits.\n     The padding and other data added here during the postprocessing must\n     not change the amount of hashed data. */\n  num_bits = ctx->count << 3;\n\n  /* Note: (count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1))\n           equals (count % MD5_BLOCK_SIZE) for this block size. */\n  bytes_have = (unsigned int) (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1));\n\n  /* Input data must be padded with a single bit \"1\", then with zeros and\n     the finally the length of data in bits must be added as the final bytes\n     of the last block.\n     See RFC 1321, Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 (steps 1 and 2). */\n  /* Data is always processed in form of bytes (not by individual bits),\n     therefore position of the first padding bit in byte is always\n     predefined (0x80). */\n  /* Buffer always have space for one byte at least (as full buffers are\n     processed immediately). */\n  ((uint8_t *) ctx->buffer)[bytes_have++] = 0x80;\n\n  if (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have < MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD)\n  {   /* No space in the current block to put the total length of message.\n         Pad the current block with zeros and process it. */\n    if (bytes_have < MD5_BLOCK_SIZE)\n      memset (((uint8_t *) ctx->buffer) + bytes_have, 0,\n              MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have);\n    /* Process the full block. */\n    md5_transform (ctx->H, ctx->buffer);\n    /* Start the new block. */\n    bytes_have = 0;\n  }\n\n  /* Pad the rest of the buffer with zeros. */\n  memset (((uint8_t *) ctx->buffer) + bytes_have, 0,\n          MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD - bytes_have);\n  /* Put the number of bits in processed data as little-endian value.\n     See RFC 1321, clauses 2 and 3.2 (step 2). */\n  _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE (ctx->buffer + MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS - 2,\n                          num_bits);\n  /* Process the full final block. */\n  md5_transform (ctx->H, ctx->buffer);\n\n  /* Put in LE mode the hash as the final digest.\n     See RFC 1321, clauses 2 and 3.5 (step 5). */\n#ifndef _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED\n  if (1\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n      && (0 != ((uintptr_t) digest) % _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN)\n#endif /* MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE */\n      )\n  {\n    /* If storing of the final result requires aligned address and\n       the destination address is not aligned or compact code is used,\n       store the final digest in aligned temporary buffer first, then\n       copy it to the destination. */\n    uint32_t alig_dgst[MD5_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS];\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE (alig_dgst + 0, ctx->H[0]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE (alig_dgst + 1, ctx->H[1]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE (alig_dgst + 2, ctx->H[2]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE (alig_dgst + 3, ctx->H[3]);\n    /* Copy result to the unaligned destination address. */\n    memcpy (digest, alig_dgst, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE);\n  }\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  else /* Combined with the next 'if' */\n#endif /* MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE */\n#endif /* ! _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED */\n#if ! defined(MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) || defined(_MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED)\n  if (1)\n  {\n    /* Use cast to (void*) here to mute compiler alignment warnings.\n     * Compilers are not smart enough to see that alignment has been checked. */\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE ((void *) (digest + 0 * MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD), ctx->H[0]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE ((void *) (digest + 1 * MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD), ctx->H[1]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE ((void *) (digest + 2 * MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD), ctx->H[2]);\n    _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE ((void *) (digest + 3 * MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD), ctx->H[3]);\n  }\n#endif /* !
