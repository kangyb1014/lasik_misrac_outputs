  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function intentionally allocates and returns a mutable struct MHD_Response * for the caller to modify/manage (e.g. update fields, free it). Applying const to the pointee would prevent the intended use. A violation would occur if the returned object were intended to be read-only (in which case the function should return a pointer to const, e.g. const struct MHD_Response *)."
