  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer r is declared as struct MHD_Response * and points to heap-allocated, mutable data that is modified (r->fd, r->reference_count, r->flags) before being freed. Rule 8.13 requires using const-qualified pointers when the pointee does not need modification; here the pointee is modified, so it must not be const. The call free(r) is correct (free expects a void * to mutable storage). Thus this code fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
