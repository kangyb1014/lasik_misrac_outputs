  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types or they clearly require a mutable (non-const) pointee: the field assignments (r->fd = -1; r->reference_count = 1; r->flags = flags;) modify members of the newly allocated object so the pointee must be mutable; the NULL check (if (NULL != r)) and the conditional around MHD_mutex_init_ are control-flow checks rather than pointer declarations; comments and the MHD_mutex_init_ call argument (&r->mutex) indicate passing a mutex object that the initializer will modify, so const qualification would be inappropriate. The selected fragments cover all locations where pointer types or pointer returns appear and therefore need review for possible const qualification."
