  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_empty:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_empty (enum MHD_ResponseFlags flags)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  r = (struct MHD_Response *) MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL != r)\n  {\n    if (MHD_mutex_init_ (&r->mutex))\n    {\n      r->fd = -1;\n      r->reference_count = 1;\n      /* If any flags combination will be not allowed, replace the next\n       * assignment with MHD_set_response_options() call. */\n      r->flags = flags;\n\n      return r; /* Successful result */\n    }\n    free (r);\n  }\n  return NULL; /* Something failed */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nr->fd = -1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown context: the assignment r->fd = -1 initializes the fd member of the newly allocated response object and therefore is not dead unless the fd field is never subsequently read. A concrete violation scenario would be: across the entire project the struct member fd is never accessed after this initialization (no reads, checks or uses), so removing this assignment would not affect program behaviour \u2014 in that case the assignment would be dead code and Rule 2.2 would be violated."
