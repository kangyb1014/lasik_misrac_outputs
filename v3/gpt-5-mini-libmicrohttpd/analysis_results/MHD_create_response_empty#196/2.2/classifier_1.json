  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_empty:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_empty (enum MHD_ResponseFlags flags)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  r = (struct MHD_Response *) MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL != r)\n  {\n    if (MHD_mutex_init_ (&r->mutex))\n    {\n      r->fd = -1;\n      r->reference_count = 1;\n      /* If any flags combination will be not allowed, replace the next\n       * assignment with MHD_set_response_options() call. */\n      r->flags = flags;\n\n      return r; /* Successful result */\n    }\n    free (r);\n  }\n  return NULL; /* Something failed */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nr->reference_count = 1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment r->reference_count = 1; is initializing the newly allocated response object's reference count. This is not dead code because removal would change program behaviour whenever other code inspects or manipulates that field (e.g. functions that increment/decrement or check reference_count to manage lifetime). Only if it can be proven across the whole project that reference_count is never read or used would this assignment be dead; with the provided snippet alone, the assignment is not dead."
