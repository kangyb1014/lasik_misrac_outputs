  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_empty:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_empty (enum MHD_ResponseFlags flags)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  r = (struct MHD_Response *) MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL != r)\n  {\n    if (MHD_mutex_init_ (&r->mutex))\n    {\n      r->fd = -1;\n      r->reference_count = 1;\n      /* If any flags combination will be not allowed, replace the next\n       * assignment with MHD_set_response_options() call. */\n      r->flags = flags;\n\n      return r; /* Successful result */\n    }\n    free (r);\n  }\n  return NULL; /* Something failed */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nr->flags = flags;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment r->flags = flags is not dead code in this context: it initializes the response object\u2019s flags before returning the newly allocated struct so subsequent code can read those flags. There is no evidence in the fragment that the field is never read or always overwritten before use. (If elsewhere in the program the field is never accessed or is always overwritten before any read, then this assignment would be dead and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
