  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function init_rand_data contains calls only to standard/system APIs (open, read, close, fprintf, strerror, CryptAcquireContext, CryptGenRandom, CryptReleaseContext, GetLastError) and does not call itself directly. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other user-defined functions invoked from within init_rand_data that could create an indirect call cycle back to init_rand_data. The function is self-contained and static, and no recursive invocation is present in the provided code. Therefore, no fragments require investigation for Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls)."
