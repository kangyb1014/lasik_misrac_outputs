  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 targets use of the string handling functions from <string.h> that accept pointer parameters (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). In this function there are no uses of those functions. The only usages related to <string.h> are the two strerror(...) calls passed to fprintf \u2014 these are the only calls that need review under Rule 21.17. Other code fragments (open/read/close, CryptAcquireContext, CryptGenRandom, CryptReleaseContext, fprintf with string literals, and pointer/size arithmetic around rand_data) do not invoke <string.h> string-handling functions and therefore are out of scope for Rule 21.17 (though the read loop bug that repeatedly reads into rand_data without using the offset is a separate, non-Rule-21.17 issue)."
