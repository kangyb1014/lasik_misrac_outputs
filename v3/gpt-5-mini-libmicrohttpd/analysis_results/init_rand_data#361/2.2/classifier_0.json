Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of init_rand_data:\n```c\nstatic int\ninit_rand_data (void)\n{\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n  int fd;\n  ssize_t len;\n  size_t off;\n\n  fd = open (\"/dev/urandom\", O_RDONLY);\n  if (-1 == fd)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to open '%s': %s\\n\",\n             \"/dev/urandom\",\n             strerror (errno));\n    return 0;\n  }\n  for (off = 0; off < sizeof(rand_data); off += (size_t) len)\n  {\n    len = read (fd, rand_data, 8);\n    if (0 > len)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to read '%s': %s\\n\",\n               \"/dev/urandom\",\n               strerror (errno));\n      (void) close (fd);\n      return 0;\n    }\n  }\n  (void) close (fd);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n  HCRYPTPROV cc;\n  BOOL b;\n\n  b = CryptAcquireContext (&cc,\n                           NULL,\n                           NULL,\n                           PROV_RSA_FULL,\n                           CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);\n  if (FALSE == b)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to acquire crypto provider context: %lu\\n\",\n             (unsigned long) GetLastError ());\n    return 0;\n  }\n  b = CryptGenRandom (cc, sizeof(rand_data), (BYTE *) rand_data);\n  if (FALSE == b)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to generate 8 random bytes: %lu\\n\",\n             GetLastError ());\n  }\n  CryptReleaseContext (cc, 0);\n  if (FALSE == b)\n    return 0;\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfprintf (stderr, \"Failed to acquire crypto provider context: %lu\\n\",\n             (unsigned long) GetLastError ());\n    return 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
