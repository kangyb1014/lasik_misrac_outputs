  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant as described by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Detailed reasoning:\n\n- The only loop is: for (off = 0; off < sizeof(rand_data); off += (size_t) len)\n  - Although sizeof(rand_data) is a compile-time constant, the controlling expression (off < sizeof(rand_data)) depends on the variable off, which is updated each iteration. Therefore the controlling expression is not invariant. (Note: a runtime condition where read returns 0 could cause an infinite loop, but that is a dynamic behavior issue, not an invariant controlling-expression violation under Rule 14.3.)\n\n- All if statements use comparisons against variables or results of functions/calls and thus are not invariant:\n  - if (-1 == fd) depends on the result of open()\n  - if (0 > len) depends on len set by read()\n  - if (FALSE == b) depends on b set by CryptAcquireContext/CryptGenRandom\n\n- There are no while or do-while loops with constant controlling expressions. The do-while exception is not applicable because no do-while exists.\n\n- Preprocessor conditional (#if ! defined(_WIN32) ...) does not create a controlling expression at runtime and is not relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated specifically for invariant controlling expressions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
