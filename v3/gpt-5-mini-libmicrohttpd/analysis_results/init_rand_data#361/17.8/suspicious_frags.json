  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function init_rand_data has no parameters (signature: init_rand_data(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated here. All assignments and modifications in the body affect local variables (fd, len, off, cc, b) or global data (rand_data) but not function parameters. Calls that pass pointers (e.g. read(fd, rand_data, 8), CryptGenRandom(cc, sizeof(rand_data), (BYTE *) rand_data), CryptAcquireContext(&cc, ...)) may cause the called functions to modify objects via pointer arguments; that is allowed by the rule (the object pointed to may be modified, the rule forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself). No code in this function assigns to or modifies any formal parameter, so there are no fragments to investigate for Rule 17.8."
