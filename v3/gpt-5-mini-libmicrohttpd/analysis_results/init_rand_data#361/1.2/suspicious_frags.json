  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code contains platform-specific APIs and types (open/read/ssize_t on POSIX, CryptAcquireContext/HCRYPTPROV/BOOL/BYTE on Windows) and uses predefined platform macros (_WIN32, __CYGWIN__) to select the appropriate branch; these are platform/OS APIs or standard/predefined macros rather than compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of documented compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __inline__ or other vendor keywords, typeof, statement-expressions, __declspec, __extension__, or other nonstandard language constructs. The casts, sizeof, return !0, and explicit type uses (size_t, ssize_t, int) are standard C or provided by platform headers. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
