First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nViolation: the third clause 'off += (size_t) len' uses the object 'len', which is assigned in the loop body (len = read(...)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 clause 3 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the for-loop body. The first and second clauses are acceptable, but using 'len' (modified in the body) in the third clause violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the for statement\n  for (off = 0; off < sizeof(rand_data); off += (size_t) len)\nthe third clause uses the object len, but len is assigned in the loop body (len = read(...)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 clause 3 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the loop body (and the loop body includes the effects of any functions called). Because len is modified in the body, using it in the third clause violates the rule. A straightforward fix is to make the third clause empty and update off inside the loop body after the read (e.g. for (off = 0; off < sizeof(rand_data); ) { len = read(...); ... off += (size_t)len; })."
