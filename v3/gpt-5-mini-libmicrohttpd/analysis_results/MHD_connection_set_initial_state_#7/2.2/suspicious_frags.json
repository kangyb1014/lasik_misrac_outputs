  "explanation": "Lines not listed above were judged not suspicious for MISRA C Rule 2.2 (dead code) for the following reasons: the function header and local variable declaration are necessary for scope and type; the allocation call and the assignment of c->read_buffer_size are functional operations that affect program behaviour (they allocate and record buffer capacity) and therefore cannot be classed as dead without runtime/architectural context; the asserts (apart from the HTTPS block included above) are explicit runtime checks of preconditions and removing them changes observable behaviour when a violation occurs; the calculation of read_buf_size and its use in allocation are clearly used and thus not dead. The fragments reported above are those that may be redundant with the preceding memsets or otherwise appear to be executed assignments/assertions whose removal might not change program behaviour and thus warrant investigation. No other lines were flagged because they perform non-redundant actions (allocation, size computation, state-dependent checks) or are required for correct initialization semantics and timing."
