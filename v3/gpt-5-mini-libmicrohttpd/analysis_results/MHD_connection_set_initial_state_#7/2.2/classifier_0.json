  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_set_initial_state_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_connection_set_initial_state_ (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  size_t read_buf_size;\n\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  mhd_assert ( (0 == (c->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS)) || \\\n               (MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT == c->tls_state) );\n  mhd_assert ( (0 != (c->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS)) || \\\n               (MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS == c->tls_state) );\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_INIT == c->state);\n\n  c->keepalive = MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN;\n  c->event_loop_info = MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ;\n\n  memset (&c->rq, 0, sizeof(c->rq));\n  memset (&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp));\n\n  c->write_buffer = NULL;\n  c->write_buffer_size = 0;\n  c->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n  c->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n\n  c->continue_message_write_offset = 0;\n\n  c->read_buffer_offset = 0;\n  read_buf_size = c->daemon->pool_size / 2;\n  c->read_buffer\n    = MHD_pool_allocate (c->pool,\n                         read_buf_size,\n                         false);\n  c->read_buffer_size = read_buf_size;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nc->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
