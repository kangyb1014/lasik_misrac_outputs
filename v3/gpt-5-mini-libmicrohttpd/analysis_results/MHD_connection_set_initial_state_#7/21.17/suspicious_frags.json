  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions that can write/read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. In this function the only string.h function used is memset, in two calls: memset(&c->rq, 0, sizeof(c->rq)); and memset(&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp));. Each call passes the address of the exact object being sized with sizeof that same object, so the size argument matches the object size and cannot cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. No other <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset other than the two shown, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
