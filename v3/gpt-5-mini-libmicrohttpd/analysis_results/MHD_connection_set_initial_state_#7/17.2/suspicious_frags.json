  "explanation": "Only code fragments that invoke other functions (or macros that may expand to function calls) can create direct or indirect recursion back to MHD_connection_set_initial_state_. The listed fragments contain calls to mhd_assert, memset and MHD_pool_allocate and therefore must be inspected for potential indirect/self calls. The remaining lines in the function are simple assignments, initializations, integer computations (read_buf_size = c->daemon->pool_size / 2), or structure field stores that do not call functions or dereference function pointers; these cannot by themselves cause recursion and so do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 in this context."
