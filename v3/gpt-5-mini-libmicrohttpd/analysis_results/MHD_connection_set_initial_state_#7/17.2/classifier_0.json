  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code. The call to memset(&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp)) invokes the standard library function memset, which does not call MHD_connection_set_initial_state_ (no direct or indirect recursion). A possible violation scenario would be if memset were replaced by a user-defined wrapper or macro that (directly or indirectly) invoked MHD_connection_set_initial_state_ (for example a debugging wrapper that mistakenly calls back into the initialization function), which would create indirect recursion and violate Rule 17.2."
