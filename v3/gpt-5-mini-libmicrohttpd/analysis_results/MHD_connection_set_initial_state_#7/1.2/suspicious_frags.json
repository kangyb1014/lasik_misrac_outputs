  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler or language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang-style builtins or extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or asm labels.\n- There is no use of Microsoft-specific extensions (e.g. __declspec), no inline assembly, and no nonstandard keywords.\n- The backslash characters seen are line-continuation characters (backslash-newline) used inside the mhd_assert calls; line splicing via backslash-newline is part of the C preprocessing phase in the standard and is not a compiler extension.\n- Use of standard types (size_t) and boolean literal false is consistent with standard C (stdbool.h / C99).\n- Standard library calls (memset) and pointer/structure member accesses are normal C.\n\nNote: The mhd_assert and MHD_pool_allocate identifiers are macros/functions whose definitions are not included here. If those macros or functions (their definitions elsewhere in the codebase) use compiler-specific extensions, those definitions should be inspected. Based solely on the code shown, there are no language extensions present and therefore no fragments to flag for Rule 1.2."
