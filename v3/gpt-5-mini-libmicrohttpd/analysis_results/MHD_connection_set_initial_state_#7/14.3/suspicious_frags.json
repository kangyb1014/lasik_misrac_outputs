  "explanation": "No controlling statements (if, switch, while, for, do-while) are present in the provided function body; Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of such constructs. The code contains only assignments, function calls, memset, and preprocessor conditionals. The #ifdef/endif are preprocessor directives (not C controlling expressions) and therefore are not subject to Rule 14.3 in this source fragment. The mhd_assert(...) lines supply boolean expressions as macro arguments but are macro invocations rather than explicit controlling statements in this code. Without the macro definition, we cannot see any controlling expression introduced by the macro expansion; if desired, the mhd_assert macro definition should be reviewed separately to ensure it does not expand into an invariant controlling expression. Based on the visible source alone, there are no controlling expressions to investigate for invariance, so no suspicious fragments are reported."
