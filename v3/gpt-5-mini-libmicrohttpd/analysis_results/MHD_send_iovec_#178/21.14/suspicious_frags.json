  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function. There are no calls to memcmp (nor to strcmp/strncmp) and no comparisons of null-terminated strings in this fragment. The code only performs pointer null-checks, integer/bitmask comparisons (e.g. (0 == (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))), asserts, macro-controlled returns, and calls to send_iov_nontls/send_iov_emu. Those called functions are outside the provided fragment \u2014 if their implementations are to be checked for Rule 21.14, their source must be provided. Based on the supplied code alone, there are no memcmp usages to investigate for Rule 21.14."
