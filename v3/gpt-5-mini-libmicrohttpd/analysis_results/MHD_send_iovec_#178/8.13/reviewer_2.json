  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not verifiable from the snippet and so I judge it not correct as stated. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. The provided function only performs assertions on connection->rp.response->data_iov (checking it is non-NULL) and does not show any modification of the pointee. However, the rule applies to the declaration of the pointer type (where data_iov is declared), and that declaration is not shown. To establish a MISRA 8.13 violation you must show that the pointer is declared non-const and that the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere in the program \u2014 i.e. the type could safely be changed to point to const. Because that whole-program information is missing, the claim cannot be confirmed from this function alone.\n\nIf you want to verify or fix this potential issue: search the codebase for any writes through connection->rp.response->data_iov (assignments to members of *data_iov or passing it to functions that modify the data). If no modifications occur, change the declaration to point to const (e.g. const struct MHD_iovec *data_iov) and update call sites. Also review r_iov: if the function and callees do not modify the pointed-to data, consider making it a pointer-to-const as well. Conversely, if any write occurs, the non-const declaration is required and there is no violation."
