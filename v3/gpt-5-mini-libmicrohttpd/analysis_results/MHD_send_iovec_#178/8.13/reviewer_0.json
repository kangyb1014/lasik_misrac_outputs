True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIn MHD_send_iovec_ the expression connection->daemon->sigpipe_blocked reads a member through the pointer connection->daemon. If daemon is declared as a plain pointer (e.g. 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon') and this function only reads from it (no modification of the pointed object), then Rule 8.13 is violated: the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon').\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. The snippet only shows uses (reads) of connection->daemon but does not show the declaration of connection or its member daemon nor the rest of the program. From this single function you cannot determine whether the daemon pointer is ever used to modify the pointed object elsewhere. Therefore you cannot conclude a MISRA 8.13 violation. To demonstrate a violation you would need the declaration of daemon (e.g. in struct MHD_Connection) and proof that the pointed-to object is never modified through that pointer anywhere in the program (or at least in all translation units where the declaration is visible). Because that evidence is absent, the agent A's report is not justified."
