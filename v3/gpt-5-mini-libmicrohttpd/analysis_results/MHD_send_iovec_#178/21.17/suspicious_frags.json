  "explanation": "No uses of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code fragment. The function contains only assertions (mhd_assert) that check pointer non-NULL and a bounds-like check (resp_iov.cnt > resp_iov.sent), conditional compilation, and calls/returns to send_iov_nontls/send_iov_emu. There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn, nor any direct manipulation of string buffers in this snippet. Therefore there are no local code fragments here that need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: the called functions send_iov_nontls and send_iov_emu are outside this snippet \u2014 they may contain string.h usages and should be checked, but they are not part of the provided code and thus not selected here.)"
