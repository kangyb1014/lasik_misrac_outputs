  "explanation": "I inspected the function for compiler-specific language extensions (examples: GNU/C extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, asm goto, __extension__, or other documented compiler extensions). None are present in the provided code.\n\nNotes on specific constructs found and why they are not flagged:\n- ssize_t: a POSIX type (not a compiler language extension per se). If the project requires strict ISO C without POSIX, this is a portability concern but not a compiler extension per the rule as stated.\n- bool: from C99 <stdbool.h> \u2014 a standard language feature, not a compiler extension.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef, #if defined(...), #endif) and backslash line continuations: standard preprocessor use.\n- Identifiers with leading underscore (e.g. _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED): these may violate naming conventions or reserved-identifier rules but are not compiler language extensions.\n\nBecause none of the recognized compiler-specific extensions appear in the code fragment, there are no suspicious fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
