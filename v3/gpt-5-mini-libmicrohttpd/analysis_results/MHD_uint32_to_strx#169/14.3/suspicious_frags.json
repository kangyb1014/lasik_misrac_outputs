  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions or are clearly variant: the listed loops/if are the only control constructs in the function. The do-while condition depends on 'digit' and 'digit_pos', both modified inside the loop. The while condition depends on 'o_pos' (and 'buf_size'), and 'o_pos' is incremented inside the loop. The if condition depends on 'digit_pos', which is modified prior to the check. The ternary used to compute the character is not a controlling expression. No other invariant controlling expressions are present in the function."
