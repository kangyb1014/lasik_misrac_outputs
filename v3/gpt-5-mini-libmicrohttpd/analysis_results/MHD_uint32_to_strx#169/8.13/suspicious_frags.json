  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this function is the parameter 'char *buf', and it is used as an output buffer (buf[o_pos++] = ...), so it cannot be const-qualified. There are no other pointer parameters, local pointer variables, or pointer-returning constructs in the function that could be changed to point to const-qualified types. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for this rule."
