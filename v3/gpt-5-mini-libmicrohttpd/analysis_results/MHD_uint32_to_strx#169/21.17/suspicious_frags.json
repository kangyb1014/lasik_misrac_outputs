  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code. Rule 21.17 specifically concerns such Standard Library functions whose pointer parameters can cause out-of-bounds accesses. The code performs direct indexed writes to buf but always checks the index against buf_size (while (o_pos < buf_size)) before assigning buf[o_pos++], and returns 0 if the buffer is too small; therefore there are no calls that could violate Rule 21.17. (Note: other concerns such as lack of a terminating NUL byte or general logic/semantic issues are outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 21.17 and so are not flagged here.)"
