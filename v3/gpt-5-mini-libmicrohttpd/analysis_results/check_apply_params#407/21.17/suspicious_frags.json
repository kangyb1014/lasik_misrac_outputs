  "explanation": "I examined the provided function check_apply_params. It contains only conditional checks, returns, and calls to other functions (show_help, print_version, check_param_*, check_apply_param_*). None of the standard <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in this code fragment. There are no direct pointer/array manipulations or buffer operations here that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses by those library functions. \n\nNote: called subroutines (e.g., show_help, print_version, check_param__*) are not included in this snippet; if those functions exist elsewhere, their implementations should be inspected for uses of the <string.h> functions. However, based solely on the provided code, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 21.17."
