If that function has no observable side-effects (for example if it returns a boolean/int and merely checks something without modifying state or producing I/O), then removing this call would not affect program behaviour \u2014 hence it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim cannot be judged correct from the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the call check_param__shared_single_unique(); is \u201cdead\u201d depends entirely on the implementation of that function: if it has observable side-effects (logging, state changes, asserts, I/O, hardware access, etc.) or its timing matters, then the call is not dead and there is no Rule 2.2 violation. Only if the function is a pure, side-effect-free routine (and its return value is ignored) would the call be dead and thus a Rule 2.2 violation. The provided code does not show the function definition, so there is insufficient evidence to conclude a violation. Recommendation: inspect the definition of check_param__shared_single_unique; if it returns a value and has no side-effects, remove it or use its result; otherwise no Rule 2.2 breach is demonstrated."
