Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments are not flagged because they either (a) use the result of the called function to decide control flow (and thus cannot be removed without changing behaviour) \u2014 e.g. the conditional checks and early returns around show_help()/print_version(), check_apply_param__thread_per_conn(), check_param__epoll(), check_param__poll(), and check_param__connections(); or (b) are simple return statements that affect control flow. The listed fragments should be investigated because they are function calls whose return values are ignored; if those functions have no required side effects, their calls would be dead code (executed but removable without changing behaviour). Also the entire static function header is flagged because a static function that is not referenced elsewhere in the translation unit is dead code and should be checked. No other lines in the provided snippet exhibit ignored results or obvious removability that would classify them as dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
