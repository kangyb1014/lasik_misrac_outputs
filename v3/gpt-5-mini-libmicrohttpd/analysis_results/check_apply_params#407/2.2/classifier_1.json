Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_params:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_params (void)\n{\n  if (tool_params.help)\n  {\n    show_help ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  else if (tool_params.version)\n  {\n    print_version ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  check_param_port ();\n  check_apply_param__all_cpus ();\n  check_apply_param__threads ();\n  if (! check_apply_param__thread_per_conn ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__epoll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__poll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large ();\n  check_param__shared_single_unique ();\n  if (! check_param__connections ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncheck_param__empty_tiny_medium_large ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The call check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large(); is a violation if the called function has no observable side\u2011effects (does not modify globals/volatile objects, perform I/O, or otherwise change program state) and its removal would not affect program behaviour. In that case the call is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, the function performs any observable side\u2011effects (or its behaviour is relied upon indirectly), the call is not dead and Rule 2.2 is not violated."
