  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (tool_params.help) and else if (tool_params.version): these test struct members (runtime data), not compile-time constants.\n- if (! check_apply_param__thread_per_conn()), if (! check_param__epoll()), if (! check_param__poll()), and if (! check_param__connections()): each uses a function call result as the controlling expression, so they are not compile-time invariant.\n- There are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) with invariant controlling expressions; the code only contains straight-line function calls and conditional returns.\n- Return statements return constant values, but returns are not controlling expressions for Rule 14.3.\nGiven all conditional tests depend on runtime values or function calls, none appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). If any of the called functions or tested fields are in fact defined as compile-time constants/macros elsewhere, those definitions should be reviewed, but within this function the controlling expressions are not manifestly invariant."
