  "explanation": "No code fragment in the supplied function is statically unreachable. Each statement can be executed depending on runtime conditions: the initial if/else-if branches both return only when their respective conditions are true (the else-if is reachable when tool_params.help is false), the intermediate returns depend on the boolean results of the various check_...() calls, and the final return 0 is reachable when none of the checks trigger an earlier return. There are no statements placed after an unconditional return in the same block, no infinite loops that block following code, and no compile-time-constant conditions that make any branch impossible to reach based on the provided snippet. Determination of any additional unreachable code would require further context (e.g. definitions of tool_params or the check_...() functions), but based solely on this code fragment there are no violations of Rule 2.1 to flag."
