The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because they are part of essential parsing logic or control flow that is clearly reachable and has observable side-effects: assignments to connection->rq.http_ver and calls to transmit_error_response_static affect program state or produce output, and the character-by-character checks (e.g. comparisons of h[0]..h[7], '.' and '/') are necessary to determine validity of the input string. The return statements are part of the defined control flow (they prevent fall-through) and are not dead. The remaining expressions and comparisons are prerequisites for deciding which branch to execute and therefore cannot be removed without changing behaviour."
