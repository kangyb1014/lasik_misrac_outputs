  "explanation": "No code fragments in parse_http_version appear to be statically unreachable. Reasoning: the top-level guard (len and character checks) gates entry to the main logic; subsequent branches depend on the runtime value of h[5] and h[7] (digits '0'..'9') so the three major-branch outcomes (major == 1, major == 0, major >= 2) are all reachable at runtime. There are no statements after unconditional returns, no mutually contradictory constant conditions, and no compile-time constant expressions that would render a branch impossible. The mhd_assert does not introduce unreachable code (it may be a no-op in non-debug builds but does not hide any later code). Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
