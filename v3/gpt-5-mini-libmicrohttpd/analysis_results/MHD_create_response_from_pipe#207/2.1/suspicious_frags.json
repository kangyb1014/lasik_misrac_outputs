  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- Control flow is straightforward: call MHD_create_response_from_callback, check its return value, and either return NULL (when response is NULL) or execute the subsequent assignments and return response. Both the early return and the later return are reachable depending on the result of the called function.\n- There are no statements after an unconditional return, no dead branches, no loops that never exit, and no switch/case constructs that would introduce unreachable labels.\n- The _MHD_EXTERN macro only affects linkage/visibility and does not introduce unreachable code in the function body.\n- All variables and parameters used (response, fd) are referenced in reachable code paths.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
