  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_pipe:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_pipe (int fd)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_callback (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &pipe_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = fd;\n  response->is_pipe = true;\n  response->crc_cls = response;\n  return response;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresponse->crc_cls = response;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Cannot determine from this fragment alone; the assignment is not inherently dead. If the crc_cls member is subsequently read or relied upon (e.g. for callbacks, cleanup, or self-references) then the assignment is required and not dead. This would be a violation of Rule 2.2 only in a specific situation: if crc_cls is never read (or is always overwritten before any read) anywhere in the program, then removing the assignment would not affect program behaviour and the assignment would be dead code (violation)."
