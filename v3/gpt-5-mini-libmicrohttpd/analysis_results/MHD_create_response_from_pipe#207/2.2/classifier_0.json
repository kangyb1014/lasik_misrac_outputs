  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_pipe:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_pipe (int fd)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_callback (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &pipe_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = fd;\n  response->is_pipe = true;\n  response->crc_cls = response;\n  return response;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresponse->is_pipe = true;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not enough evidence in the snippet to prove this assignment is dead. As written, response->is_pipe = true; sets observable state that other code (e.g. response consumers or serializers) may read \u2014 so removal could change program behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated here. (If, however, in the whole project the member is never read anywhere, then this assignment would be dead code: removing it would not affect behaviour, which would violate Rule 2.2.)"
