  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve function calls or callback function pointers can lead to direct or indirect recursion and therefore must be investigated for compliance with Rule 17.2. The assignment to 'response' via a call to MHD_create_response_from_callback and the callback pointers passed (&pipe_reader and &free_callback) are the relevant items: MHD_create_response_from_callback may call back into other functions (potentially MHD_create_response_from_pipe) via these callbacks or via other calls it makes. Other lines in the function do not perform function calls or pass function pointers and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect self-calls: the function header and local declaration, the null-check and return, the simple assignments 'response->fd = fd;', 'response->is_pipe = true;', and 'response->crc_cls = response;' do not invoke functions and thus are not relevant to Rule 17.2."
