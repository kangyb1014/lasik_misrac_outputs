  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The expression &free_callback merely takes the address of a separate function and does not itself perform a call, so by itself it does not cause direct or indirect self-calling and does not violate Rule 17.2. A concrete violation scenario would be if free_callback were in fact MHD_create_response_from_pipe (or if free_callback, when invoked, calls MHD_create_response_from_pipe), creating an indirect recursion when the callback is later invoked."
