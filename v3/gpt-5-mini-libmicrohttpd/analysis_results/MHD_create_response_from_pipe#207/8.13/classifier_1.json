  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the single assignment alone. The statement response->crc_cls = response; merely assigns a pointer to another pointer of the same type \u2014 this does not by itself show that a pointer was not declared const. A violation would exist if the member crc_cls is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. \"struct MHD_Response *crc_cls;\") but is only ever used for read-only access; in that case MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 would require it to be declared as \"const struct MHD_Response *crc_cls;\". Because the declaration of crc_cls is not shown, no definite rule violation can be concluded from the fragment."
