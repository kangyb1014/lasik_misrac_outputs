  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not listed because they affect program behaviour and should not be treated as candidates for dead-code under Rule 2.2 without further context: - The algorithm-specific finish/finish_reset calls (MHD_MD5_finish, MHD_MD5_finish_reset, MHD_SHA256_finish, MHD_SHA256_finish_reset, MHD_SHA512_256_finish) produce the digest and therefore clearly affect behaviour; they must be investigated only for correctness, not for being dead. - The if/else selection chain (comparisons of da->algo to MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_...) and the surrounding #ifdef blocks control which algorithm code is compiled in; these control-flow constructs are necessary to select the correct implementation and are not inherently dead. - The initial mhd_assert calls (mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised); mhd_assert (da->algo_selected); mhd_assert (da->ready_for_hashing);) are precondition checks and are not dead-code in the sense of an operation executed whose removal would not affect behaviour; if assertions are compiled out in non-debug builds, they are intentionally inactive. - The #ifdef guard blocks surrounding algorithm support are conditional compilation choices; the functions within them are active when the respective support macro is defined and therefore are not automatically dead. - Any code not included in the suspicious_frags list above is either a necessary digest operation, a conditional compile guard, or an assertion/precondition; these should not be flagged as dead-code without further evidence that they are executed yet redundant."
