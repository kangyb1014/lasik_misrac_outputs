  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no for statements or loop constructs in the source text. The elements present are assertions, conditional (if/else) branches and calls to finish/reset functions (e.g. MHD_MD5_finish, MHD_SHA256_finish, etc.), but none of these lines contain a for loop or loop counter expressions as defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. Therefore there are no in-file for-loop fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 14.2.\n\nNotes and rationale:\n- Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements. The code contains no literal for tokens or for statement syntax to analyze.\n- Preconditions and function calls (including via macros) are visible here only as call sites; any for loops inside the implementations of those functions/macros would be in their own definitions (not present in this fragment) and should be inspected in their respective source/expand contexts. Because the instruction requires reporting only code fragments that exist in the provided code, those external definitions are outside this report.\n- Conditional compilation sections and the chained if/else structure do not affect Rule 14.2 unless they contain for statements, which they do not here.\n\nIf you want,a follow-up step would be to expand and inspect the definitions of the called functions/macros (MHD_*_finish, MHD_*_finish_reset, etc.) to ensure any for loops they contain comply with Rule 14.2."
