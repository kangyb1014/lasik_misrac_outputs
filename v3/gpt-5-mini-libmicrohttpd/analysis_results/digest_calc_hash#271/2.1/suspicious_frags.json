  "explanation": "All other code fragments are parts of the intended algorithm selection chain and conditional compilation and do not represent obviously unreachable code: each algorithm-specific if/else block is guarded by feature macros and is reachable in a build where that feature macro is defined and at runtime when da->algo matches the branch. The _DEBUG blocks inside those branches are reachable in debug builds. The alternate finish / finish_reset fragments are mutually exclusive by compile-time macros and produce code that is reachable in the corresponding configuration. The only potential unreachable-code issue is that mhd_assert(0) may be a non-returning assertion in some builds; therefore the statement guarded by _DEBUG after it could be unreachable \u2014 that is why the two fragments above were marked for investigation. No other fragments appear to be statically unreachable."
