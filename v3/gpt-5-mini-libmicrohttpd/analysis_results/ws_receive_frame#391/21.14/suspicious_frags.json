  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) are present in the provided code. The code performs byte-wise / integer comparisons (e.g. frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME), flength == 126, etc.), bitwise operations, and byte-wise XOR to unmask data. Although the code terminates the extracted message with a '\\0', there is no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The only standard library function called is malloc, which is unrelated to Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for this MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
