  "explanation": "The only pointer in the function that is only read (and never written through) is the parameter 'frame', so it should be investigated for possible const qualification. Other pointer-like entities do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'ssize_t *length' and 'int *type' are written to via assignments (*length = ...; *type = ...), so they cannot be const-qualified; 'unsigned char *msg' is written into (msg[j] = ...), so it also cannot be const; 'masks' is an array, not a pointer, and is written to. No other pointer declarations or usages appear in the function that could be made const."
