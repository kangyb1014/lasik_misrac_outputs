First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of ws_receive_frame.\n```c\nstatic unsigned char *\nws_receive_frame (unsigned char *frame, ssize_t *length, int *type)\n{\n  unsigned char masks[4];\n  unsigned char mask;\n  unsigned char *msg;\n  unsigned char flength;\n  unsigned char idx_first_mask;\n  unsigned char idx_first_data;\n  size_t data_length;\n  int i;\n  int j;\n\n  msg = NULL;\n  if (frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME))\n  {\n    *type = WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME;\n    idx_first_mask = 2;\n    mask = frame[1];\n    flength = mask & 0x7F;\n    if (flength == 126)\n    {\n      idx_first_mask = 4;\n    }\n    else if (flength == 127)\n    {\n      idx_first_mask = 10;\n    }\n    idx_first_data = (unsigned char) (idx_first_mask + 4);\n    data_length = (size_t) *length - idx_first_data;\n    masks[0] = frame[idx_first_mask + 0];\n    masks[1] = frame[idx_first_mask + 1];\n    masks[2] = frame[idx_first_mask + 2];\n    masks[3] = frame[idx_first_mask + 3];\n    msg = malloc (data_length + 1);\n    if (NULL != msg)\n    {\n      for (i = idx_first_data, j = 0; i < *length; i++, j++)\n      {\n        msg[j] = frame[i] ^ masks[j % 4];\n      }\n      *length = (ssize_t) data_length;\n      msg[j] = '\\0';\n    }\n  }\n  else if (frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME))\n  {\n    *type = WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    *type = frame[0] & 0x0F;\n  }\n  return msg;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop initializes and updates two variables (i and j) as loop counters: \"for (i = idx_first_data, j = 0; i < *length; i++, j++)\". MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires there be only one loop counter and that the third clause modify only that loop counter. Because this loop uses and modifies two counters (i and j) it is not well-formed and thus violates Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The for statement \"for (i = idx_first_data, j = 0; i < *length; i++, j++)\" initializes and updates two distinct loop counters (i and j). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires there be only one loop counter in a for loop and that the third clause modify only that loop counter. Additionally, the rule allows a single loop control flag (a Boolean identifier) in the condition, which j is not. Therefore the code as written violates Rule 14.2. (A compliant fix is to use a single loop counter, e.g. use i as the sole counter and compute j from i: j = i - idx_first_data.)"
