  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call itself is not inherently a MISRA 21.17 violation: memset(key, 0, sizeof(*key)) uses the compile\u2011time size of the object type pointed to by key (struct MHD_IPCount) and is safe provided that 'key' actually points to a valid MHD_IPCount object of at least that size. A violation scenario would occur if the caller passes an invalid or too-small object (for example, key == NULL or key points into a smaller buffer such as malloc(4) or into a different smaller struct), in which case memset would write beyond the bounds and violate Rule 21.17."
