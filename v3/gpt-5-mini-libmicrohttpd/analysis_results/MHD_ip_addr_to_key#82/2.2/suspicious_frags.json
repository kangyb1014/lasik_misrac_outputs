  "explanation": "I have limited the suspicious fragments to the explicit initialization at the top (memset) and the two address-handling branches (the IPv4 block and the IPv6 block guarded by #ifdef). Other parts of the function were not included because they are not candidates for dead-code investigation in this context: the function signature and return type are the required interface; the final return (the 'Some other address' comment and the return MHD_NO;) is needed to indicate failure when neither address branch applies and its removal would change observable behaviour; the preprocessor guard (#ifdef HAVE_INET6) is a compile-time inclusion mechanism (not runtime dead code) and so is not itself a runtime dead-code candidate; basic control-structure tokens (braces, comments) and the literal return tokens are structural and not dead code. No other statements outside the three listed fragments appear to be operations that are executed yet removable without affecting program behaviour, so they do not require further investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.2 compliance."
