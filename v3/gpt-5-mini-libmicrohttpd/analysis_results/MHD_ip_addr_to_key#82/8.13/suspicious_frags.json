  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: \n- The only pointer parameters are \"const struct sockaddr_storage *addr\" and \"struct MHD_IPCount *key\". \"addr\" is already const-qualified (as required by Rule 8.13). \"key\" is intentionally non-const because the function writes into it (memset, assignments, memcpy destination), so it must not be const. \n- All casts from addr use const-qualified target types (e.g. (const struct sockaddr_in *) addr and (const struct sockaddr_in6 *) addr), so pointers derived from addr are const-qualified. The memcpy sources are obtained from those const-qualified members and therefore supply const-qualified source pointers to memcpy. \n- The use of ((const struct sockaddr_in *) NULL)->sin_addr and the analogous IPv6 sizeof expression only appear in sizeof and do not constitute dereferencing at runtime; they also use const-qualified pointer types. \n- No other pointer declarations or usages in this function could reasonably be made const without preventing necessary modifications.\nTherefore there are no code fragments here that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
