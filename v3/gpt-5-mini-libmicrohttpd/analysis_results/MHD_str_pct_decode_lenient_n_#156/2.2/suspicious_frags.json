  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were reviewed and considered unlikely to be dead code: the initial r/w initialization and the setting of *broken_encoding to false are necessary to establish initial state; the loop increments (++r, ++w), buffer-size check (if (w >= buf_size) return 0;), and the '%' handling logic (including calls to toxdigitvalue and the conditional writes to decoded[w]) affect control flow and observable behaviour and therefore are not removable without changing program behaviour. The duplicated overall structure (two variants of the loop) is gated by the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE preprocessor symbol; each variant is reachable depending on build configuration so the duplication itself is not automatically dead. Simple assignments that update indices and the tests comparing h and l against 0 are required to preserve decoding semantics and error reporting via broken_encoding; removing them would change behaviour. Therefore only the listed fragments (conditional compilation block, duplicated loop, the nested/cascading casts producing 'out', the r -= 2 restoration, the truncated-percent branch, and the initial broken_encoding initialization) warrant further investigation for potential dead/redundant operations or unreachable/never-effective code."
