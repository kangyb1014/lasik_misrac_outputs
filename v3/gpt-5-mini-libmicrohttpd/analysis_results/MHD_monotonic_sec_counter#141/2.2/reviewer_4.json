  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The literal \"if (1)\" branches shown are conditionally compiled and are used to select a particular timing source on platforms where that source exists. Removing the conditional wrapper may appear to be a purely syntactic change, but it can change program behaviour in ways that the rule explicitly calls out (note 1): the timing (and therefore observable behaviour) can change if an instruction is removed, and the conditional participates in which code path is taken on a given platform/configuration. In addition these constructs are deliberate structural choices under different #if branches. Because you cannot demonstrate that removing the if(1) would have no effect on observable behaviour for the project as a whole, it is not provably dead code under Rule 2.2. Therefore the agent A claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
