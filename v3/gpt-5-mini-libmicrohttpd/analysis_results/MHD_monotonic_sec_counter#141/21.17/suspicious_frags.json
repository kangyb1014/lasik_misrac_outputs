  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies specifically to use of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring they do not access beyond object bounds. The provided function contains no calls to any of the listed string-handling functions or other <string.h> APIs. The code only uses time-related APIs (clock_gettime, clock_get_time, GetTickCount64, QueryPerformanceCounter, gethrtime, time), integer casts and arithmetic, and passes addresses of fixed-sized timing structures (struct timespec, mach_timespec_t, LARGE_INTEGER) to OS APIs. There are no buffer copies, no pointer arithmetic operating on character buffers, and no uses of the standard string functions that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
