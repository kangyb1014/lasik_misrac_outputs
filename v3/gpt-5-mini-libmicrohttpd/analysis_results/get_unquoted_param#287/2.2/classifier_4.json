  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_unquoted_param:\n```c\nstatic enum _MHD_GetUnqResult\nget_unquoted_param (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                    char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                    char **ptmp2,\n                    size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                    struct _MHD_str_w_len *unquoted)\n{\n  char *str;\n  size_t len;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n\n  if (! param->quoted)\n  {\n    unquoted->str = param->value.str;\n    unquoted->len = param->value.len;\n    return _MHD_UNQ_OK;\n  }\n  /* The value is present and is quoted, needs to be copied and unquoted */\n  str = get_buffer_for_size (tmp1, ptmp2, ptmp2_size, param->value.len);\n  if (NULL == str)\n    return (param->value.len > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE) ?\n           _MHD_UNQ_TOO_LARGE : _MHD_UNQ_OUT_OF_MEM;\n\n  len = MHD_str_unquote (param->value.str, param->value.len, str);\n  unquoted->str = str;\n  unquoted->len = len;\n  mhd_assert (0 != unquoted->len);\n  mhd_assert (unquoted->len < param->value.len);\n  return _MHD_UNQ_OK;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0 != unquoted->len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The mhd_assert(0 != unquoted->len) is an assertion used to check an invariant. It is not dead code because (a) when assertions are enabled it can change program behaviour (it aborts on failure), so removal would affect behaviour, and (b) when assertions are disabled the macro typically expands to nothing so there is no executed operation to be considered dead. Only if mhd_assert were implemented as a no-op that still evaluates its argument with no side-effects would this be executed yet removable without effect (which would be an implementation error); given a normal assert implementation this fragment does not violate Rule 2.2."
