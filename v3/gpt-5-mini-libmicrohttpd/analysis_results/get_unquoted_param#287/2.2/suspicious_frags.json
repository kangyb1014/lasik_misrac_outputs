  "explanation": "I flagged the assertion statements and the conditional return that selects between _MHD_UNQ_TOO_LARGE and _MHD_UNQ_OUT_OF_MEM as items that should be investigated for possible dead code. Assertions are often implemented as no-ops in production builds (or may only be active in debug builds); if they have no side effects their presence could represent code that is executed in some builds but removable without changing program behaviour. The ternary expression that distinguishes TOO_LARGE vs OUT_OF_MEM should be checked to ensure both outcomes are reachable in the actual project environment (otherwise one branch may be effectively dead). Other fragments (calls to get_buffer_for_size, the call to MHD_str_unquote, the assignments to unquoted->str/unquoted->len in the quoted path, the buffer assignment to str, and the final return of _MHD_UNQ_OK) perform the core functionality (allocation, copying/unquoting, output parameter population and return codes). Removing those operations would change program behaviour, so they are not reported as suspicious for dead code. Also, there is no obvious unreachable code pattern in this function (note MISRA Rule 2.2 excludes unreachable code), so I limited reporting to fragments that are commonly subject to being no-op/unused in different build configurations or that may contain unreachable branches at project level."
