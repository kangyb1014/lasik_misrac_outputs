True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer username_info is used only as input to find_entry_by_userinfo (read-only). If find_entry_by_userinfo is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *), then this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The compliant form would be to declare and use a const-qualified pointer (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info) and to change find_entry_by_userinfo to accept a const pointer parameter.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not enough information to prove a definite MISRA 8.13 violation from the snippet alone. Username_info is only read (never modified) and therefore could legitimately be declared as pointing to const. However, whether the rule is actually violated depends on the declarations of the called functions (in particular find_entry_by_userinfo and MHD_digest_auth_get_username3):\n\n- If find_entry_by_userinfo already accepts a const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *, or if changing that function's prototype is feasible, then username_info should be declared as const and the current code would be non-compliant with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n- If find_entry_by_userinfo requires a non-const pointer (and cannot be changed because it is an external API), then you cannot declare username_info const without causing type mismatches when calling that function, and the code would not necessarily violate 8.13 in a way that can be fixed locally.\n\nSo the agent\u2019s claim is plausible but not provable from the provided code alone. If the helper function(s) can be changed (or already use const), the report is correct and username_info should be declared const and find_entry_by_userinfo should accept a const pointer. If the helper has a non-const external API that cannot be changed, the report cannot be confirmed."
