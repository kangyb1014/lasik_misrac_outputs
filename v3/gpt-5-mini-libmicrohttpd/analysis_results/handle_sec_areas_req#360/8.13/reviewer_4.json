True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable userdigest is declared as void * and is assigned from user_entry->userdigest_sha256, but the digest buffer is only read (not modified) by MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, pointers that refer to data that should not be modified must be const-qualified. Here userdigest should be declared const void * (and, if possible, the user_entry digest members should be const-qualified). As written, a non-const pointer is used to refer to read-only digest data (or may discard a const qualifier if the member is const), which violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is plausible and (most likely) correct. In the shown code the local pointer userdigest is only used for read-only access: it\u2019s assigned from user_entry->userdigest_* and then passed as an input to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3; there are no writes through userdigest in this function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so userdigest should be declared const void * if the pointed-at data are not modified. Declaring it const would also accept pointers to non-const arrays (non-const-to-const conversion is allowed), so that change is normally safe. The only situation in which the report would be incorrect is if MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 actually expects a non-const pointer and may modify the buffer (or some other call/usage requires mutability) \u2014 in that case you cannot make userdigest const and no Rule 8.13 violation exists. Absent the definitions of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 and struct UserEntry, we can\u2019t be absolutely certain, but given the code semantics the pointer should be const and therefore the reported violation is very likely correct. Recommendation: change the declaration to const void *userdigest (and consider const-qualifying the digest members in UserEntry if they are immutable)."
