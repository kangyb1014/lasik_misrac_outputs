    "response =\n      MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (DENIED),\n                                              DENIED);"

  "explanation": "The rule concerns use of functions from <string.h> that may read past object bounds. The only explicit standard string function calls in this snippet are the two strlen() usages above; those should be investigated to ensure DENIED and PAGE are valid, null-terminated objects and that the provided lengths match the actual buffers. Other parts of the function do not call any of the listed <string.h> functions (memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn other than the two flagged instances), and the remaining string literals (username, password, realm, MY_OPAQUE_STR) are passed to application/library functions rather than directly to <string.h> routines in this code. Pointer checks and other logic (e.g., req_cls handling, MHD_* function calls) do not themselves invoke the listed string.h functions in this snippet and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 based on the provided code alone."
