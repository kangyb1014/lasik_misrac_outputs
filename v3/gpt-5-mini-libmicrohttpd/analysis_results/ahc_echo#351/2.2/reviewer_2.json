  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The expression statements such as \u201c(void) version;\u201d have no side effects and do not contribute to the observable behaviour of the program; their removal would not change program behaviour. Per the plain wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), these no-op casts are dead code. \n\nNotes and practical guidance: the idiom \u201c(void)parameter;\u201d is a common technique to silence compiler warnings about unused parameters, but that does not change the fact that it is an executed no-op and therefore meets the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2. To satisfy MISRA Rule 2.2 you should either remove the parameter name in the function definition (if the parameter is unused) or adopt an approved project-wide convention (for example a documented UNUSED macro or a compiler attribute) and justify that convention in the project\u2019s MISRA compliance rationale. If the project\u2019s documented compliance rationale explicitly permits a particular no-op suppression idiom, that may be acceptable, but absent such a justification the code as shown violates Rule 2.2."
