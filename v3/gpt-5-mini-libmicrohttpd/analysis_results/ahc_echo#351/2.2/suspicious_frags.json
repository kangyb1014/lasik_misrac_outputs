  "explanation": "All other code fragments perform control flow, data initialization or side-effecting API calls that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. In particular: the static marker (already_called_marker) and its use via *req_cls implement a two-phase request handling and cannot be removed without changing timing/behaviour; the digest-auth calls (MHD_digest_auth_check3, MHD_queue_auth_required_response3) and response creation/queue/destroy calls are externally visible operations that affect protocol behaviour; the static credential strings are referenced by the auth call; and all return paths are meaningful. The only executed statements that have no runtime effect other than suppressing compiler warnings are the explicit (void) parameter casts listed above, so those lines are reported for investigation."
