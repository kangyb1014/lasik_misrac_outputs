  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (e.g., while(1), for(;;), do/while with constant controlling expressions, or other constant conditions). This function contains no loop constructs (no for, while, or do-while) and no switch statements. All conditional statements depend on runtime values and are therefore not invariant:\n\n- if (NULL == req) \u2014 depends on *req_cls and runtime allocation state.\n- if (-1 != req->timerfd) \u2014 depends on req->timerfd set at runtime.\n- if (NULL == response) \u2014 depends on the result of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy at runtime.\n- if (-1 == req->timerfd) (after timerfd_create) \u2014 depends on the return of timerfd_create.\n- if (-1 == epoll_ctl(...)) \u2014 depends on epoll_ctl result at runtime.\n- if (-1 == timerfd_settime(...)) \u2014 depends on timerfd_settime result at runtime.\n\nNone of these are compile-time constant/invariant controlling expressions, and there are no constructs that match the rule's exceptions (infinite loops or the permitted do-while case). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
