  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statements like \u201c(void) method;\u201d are a conventional way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s behaviour; the cast-to-void does not change the program\u2019s externally observable behaviour (it only affects diagnostics and possibly trivial code-generation details). In practice compilers optimize away such no\u2011op expressions, and MISRA-appropriate coding practice allows explicit unused-parameter annotations (or other documented mechanisms) rather than treating them as dead code. Therefore the claimed Rule 2.2 violation is not justified for this cast-to-void idiom."
