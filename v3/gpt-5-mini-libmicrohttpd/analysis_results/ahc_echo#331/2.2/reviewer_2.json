  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The (void)upload_data_size; expression is an idiomatic, deliberate reference to an unused parameter to document/force a use and to suppress compiler diagnostics. MISRA C\u2019s Rule 2.2 forbids genuinely dead code \u2014 operations executed whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s behaviour \u2014 in the sense of runtime semantics. An explicit reference to a parameter is a use (and is the intended way to show the parameter is intentionally unused); it is not the sort of accidental or redundant computation the rule targets. Therefore the reported violation is not valid."
