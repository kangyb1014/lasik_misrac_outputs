  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they perform observable actions that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Examples: memory allocation (malloc), storing the new request pointer (*req_cls = req), initialization of req->timerfd and subsequent checks, creation and configuration of the timer (timerfd_create, timerfd_settime and the ts fields), epoll registration (evt setup and epoll_ctl), suspending the connection (MHD_suspend_connection) and queuing/destroying responses (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). These operations have side effects (resource creation, registration, I/O, or return-value-dependent behaviour) and removing them would change program behaviour, so they are not reported as dead-code candidates. No unreachable code blocks were detected in the provided function body."
