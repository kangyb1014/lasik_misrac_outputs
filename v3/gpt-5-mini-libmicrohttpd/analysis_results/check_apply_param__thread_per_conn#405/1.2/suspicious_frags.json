  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific notes:\n- Function signature (static int ... (void)) uses standard C storage-class and type specifiers.\n- The use of the logical-not operator (! 0, ! tool_params.thread_per_conn) and return of those values are standard C expressions, not extensions.\n- The fprintf call and adjacent string literal concatenation across source lines is standard C behavior.\n- The use of identifiers such as num_threads and tool_params.epoll are ordinary identifiers; although identifiers with leading or double underscores are reserved by the implementation, that is a namespace/reservation issue, not a compiler language extension and thus outside Rule 1.2\u2019s scope.\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific constructs present (no __attribute__, typeof, __asm__, inline assembly, statement-expressions, builtin functions, or other documented compiler extensions).\nTherefore there are no fragments to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
