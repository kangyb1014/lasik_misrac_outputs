  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two if statements above are the only controlling expressions in this function and thus should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant (e.g. that tool_params.thread_per_conn and tool_params.epoll are not compile-time constants or otherwise invariant). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the return statements (return ! 0; return 0;) are not controlling expressions (even though ! 0 is a constant expression, Rule 14.3 applies to loop/selection controlling expressions), the fprintf call and the assignment (num_threads = 1;) are not controlling expressions, and there are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions in this function."
