  "explanation": "This function has no parameters (signature: static int check_apply_param__thread_per_conn(void)); therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable. The code only reads global/tool_params members, assigns to a global num_threads, and returns values \u2014 none of these are function-parameter modifications. No pointer parameters are present, so the pointer-specific prohibition is also irrelevant. Consequently there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
