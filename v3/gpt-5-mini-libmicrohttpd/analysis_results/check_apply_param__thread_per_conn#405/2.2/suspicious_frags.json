Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have listed all code locations that could be relevant to a dead-code investigation: the function's static definition (a static function that is never called would be dead), the early-return on tool_params.thread_per_conn, the conditional branch handling tool_params.epoll (including the fprintf and its return), the assignment to num_threads, and the final return. Other elements in the snippet are just syntactic scaffolding (braces, whitespace, the function body delimiters) or standard control-flow constructs already covered above; there are no additional statements or declarations in the provided code that could represent dead code and therefore do not need further investigation based on the supplied fragment."
