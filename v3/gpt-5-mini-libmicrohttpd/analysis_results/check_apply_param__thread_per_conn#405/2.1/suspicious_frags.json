  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function is provably unreachable. Each conditional and statement can be reached under different runtime values of the tool_params flags:\n- The initial return (if (!tool_params.thread_per_conn) return !0;) is reachable when tool_params.thread_per_conn is false.\n- The fprintf + return 0 inside the if (tool_params.epoll) block is reachable when tool_params.thread_per_conn is true and tool_params.epoll is true.\n- The assignment num_threads = 1; is reachable when tool_params.thread_per_conn is true and tool_params.epoll is false.\n- The final return !0; is reachable in that same last case.\nThere is no statement in this function that cannot be executed for any possible combination of the input flags (unless external configuration makes some flags compile-time constants, which is outside the scope of this function). Therefore, with the information available here, there is no unreachable code to flag under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
