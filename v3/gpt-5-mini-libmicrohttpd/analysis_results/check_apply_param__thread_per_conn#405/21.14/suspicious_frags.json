  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the supplied function. The code does not perform any raw memory comparisons of character arrays or null-terminated strings; it only tests boolean-like fields (tool_params.thread_per_conn and tool_params.epoll), assigns num_threads, and calls fprintf with string literals. There are no calls to memcmp, nor any other raw byte-comparison functions that could be used to compare NUL-terminated strings (e.g. no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp usage). Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
