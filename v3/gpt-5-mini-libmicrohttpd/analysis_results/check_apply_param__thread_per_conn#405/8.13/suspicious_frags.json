  "explanation": "No pointer variables or pointer-typed expressions are present in the provided function that could be made to point to a const-qualified type. Specifically:\n- The function has no pointer parameters and declares no pointer local variables.\n- Accesses to tool_params use member access (tool_params.thread_per_conn, tool_params.epoll); tool_params is not used as a pointer here.\n- The call to fprintf uses a string literal for the format. The C library prototype takes a const char * for the format, so there is no un-const-qualified pointer that should be const-qualified.\n- The use of stderr involves a FILE *; making it a pointer-to-const is not appropriate because I/O functions modify the FILE object.\n- num_threads and the boolean-like checks are non-pointer scalar uses.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
