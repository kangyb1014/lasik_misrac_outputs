  "explanation": "No syntactically unreachable code fragments were found in the function. Reasoning: \n- There is no unconditional return, goto, longjmp, or abort that would make later statements unreachable. The final return NULL is reachable. \n- The while (1) loop contains a conditional break (if (0 >= got) break;), so control can and does flow out of the loop to the subsequent free(md), MHD_upgrade_action(...), and return. The loop is not an unconditional infinite loop from a static-analysis perspective. \n- The if (0 != md->extra_in_size) block is conditional and therefore not statically unreachable; it may or may not execute at runtime depending on md->extra_in_size. \n- There are no unreachable case labels, dead code after a non-void return, or statements following an unconditional jump. \nGiven these points, there are no code regions that appear statically unreachable and therefore no fragments need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this function."
