  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The code passes md->extra_in (a non-const pointer to the data to send) to send_all. The buffer is only read (sent), so md->extra_in should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const char * or const void *), and send_all should accept a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *buf). As written, the pointer is not const-qualified and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
