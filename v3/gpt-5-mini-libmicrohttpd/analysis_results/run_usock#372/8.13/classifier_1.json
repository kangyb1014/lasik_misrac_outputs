  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer md is used to free the object (free(md) and free(md->extra_in)) and to pass non-const ownership to functions that expect a modifiable object, so declaring it as const struct MyData * would be impractical (it would force casts to discard const for free/other APIs). If the function neither freed nor transferred/modified the object, then md should be a pointer to const; but in this code the non-const pointer is justified."
