  "scenario": "If the definition/prototype of send_all is something like send_all(int sock, void *buf, size_t len) or send_all(int sock, char *buf, size_t len) then Rule 8.13 is violated: the buffer is only being read by send_all and so its pointer parameter should be const-qualified (e.g. const void * or const char *) and callers should pass a pointer to const. If, however, send_all actually modifies the buffer, no violation occurs. In the absence of a const-qualified prototype for send_all, this call shows a likely violation (change send_all to take a const-qualified pointer)."
