  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this code fragment. The socket APIs used (recv, send_all) and memory management (free) are not functions from <string.h>, so they are outside the direct scope of Rule 21.17. Note: calls such as send_all(md->sock, md->extra_in, md->extra_in_size) and send_all(md->sock, buf, (size_t) got) might copy memory internally \u2014 if those implementations use memcpy/memmove/etc., those implementations should be reviewed separately. However, within this translation unit there are no direct uses of the relevant <string.h> functions to report for Rule 21.17."
