  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in this function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, standard casts (e.g. (const void *)page), standard enum and struct types, standard C comments, (void) casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings, and calls/macros from an external library (MHD_*), which are library APIs not language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, __builtin_*, GCC or MSVC-specific keywords, or other documented compiler-only extensions\u2014so no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
