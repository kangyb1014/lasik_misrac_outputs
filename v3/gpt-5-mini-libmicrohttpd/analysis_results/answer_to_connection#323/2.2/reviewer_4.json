  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The statement \u201c(void) method;\u201d is an expression statement that evaluates its operand and discards the result. It has no side effects and does not change program behaviour; removing it would not affect the runtime behaviour of the program. It is reachable (executed) and therefore falls squarely under the definition in Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d). Thus the report is correct: this is dead code according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: the same applies to the other (void) parameter statements in the function; to address this without introducing dead code, remove the parameter names from the function prototype, use a compiler/attribute or macro for an explicit unused-parameter annotation, or otherwise change the declaration so the parameters are not present if they truly are unused."
