Its removal would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code. Although commonly used to silence compiler warnings about unused parameters, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 this is a violation unless formally justified/deviated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The statement \u201c(void) req_cls;\u201d (and the other similar \u2018\u2018(void) <param>;\u2019\u2019 lines) are expression statements that have no side effects; they are executed but their removal would not change the observable behaviour of the program. That matches the given definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the construct is a violation unless a formal justification/deviation is recorded. Note: this idiom is commonly used to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters; to comply with MISRA you should either document and record a formal deviation/justification or use an alternative, MISRA-accepted approach (e.g. compiler-specific unused-attribute or other formally allowed mechanism)."
