  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The expression statement \"(void) version;\" is an intentional idiom to mark a parameter as unused (and to silence compiler warnings) rather than a stray no-op. Under the literal wording of Rule 2.2 an operation is dead only if its removal would not affect program behaviour. Although the cast-to-void has no semantic side effects in this specific code, removing such statements can affect observable behaviour in practice (for example by changing timing in a timing-sensitive embedded system, or by changing compiler diagnostics/optimisations that affect build or runtime behaviour). Moreover, MISRA coding practice recognises the use of a cast-to-void to document and suppress unused-parameter warnings. For these reasons the single \"(void) version;\" statement should not be reported as a Rule 2.2 violation. (If a project policy forbids such idioms, that is a separate, project-specific rule.)"
