  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The cast-to-void statements (e.g. (void) url;) are the common, deliberate idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Rule 2.2 prohibits code whose removal would not affect program behaviour, but that prohibition is intended for genuinely superfluous operations; the cast-to-void is an explicit authorial choice to document intent and suppress diagnostics. Moreover, per MISRA Note 1 the behaviour of an embedded system can depend on timing: an executed statement \u2014 even a no-op value computation \u2014 can in principle affect timing/observable behaviour, so it cannot be unconditionally classified as \u201cdead code.\u201d Finally, MISRA practice allows the explicit discard of an expression to indicate an unused parameter rather than treating it as a defect under Rule 2.2. For these reasons the agent A claim that (void) url; violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
