First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function in full. There are no for statements (no occurrences of the 'for' token) and no loop constructs (while/do-while) inside this code fragment. Rule 14.2 is specifically concerned with the well-formedness of for loops (their three clauses and the loop counter), so there are no in-scope constructs in this snippet that require investigation under that rule.\n\nNotes for completeness:\n- The snippet contains an if statement, assignments, a call via a function pointer (daemon->default_handler), and a macro invocation (CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR). None of these are for loops themselves, so they do not directly fall under Rule 14.2 in this fragment.\n- If the macro (CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR) or the called function (daemon->default_handler and functions it calls) are defined elsewhere and contain for loops, those definitions should be inspected separately for Rule 14.2 compliance. However, those definitions are not present in the provided code, so they cannot be reported here as suspicious fragments of this snippet."
