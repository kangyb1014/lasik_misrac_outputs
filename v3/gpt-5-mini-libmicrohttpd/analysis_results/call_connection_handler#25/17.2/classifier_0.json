  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call call_connection_handler directly, so no direct recursion is present. However a Rule 17.2 violation would occur if the function pointer daemon->default_handler (or a callee it invokes) is set to call_connection_handler or to any function that eventually calls call_connection_handler (indirect recursion). Example violating scenario: daemon->default_handler is assigned to call_connection_handler (or to function A that calls function B that calls call_connection_handler), so the call daemon->default_handler(...) would re-enter call_connection_handler and violate Rule 17.2."
