  "scenario": "The statement 'connection->in_access_handler = false;' is a simple assignment and does not invoke any function calls. It therefore cannot cause the function to call itself directly or indirectly. (Note: indirect recursion could occur elsewhere if daemon->default_handler or macros invoked other code that calls call_connection_handler, but this specific fragment is just an assignment and does not violate Rule 17.2.)"
