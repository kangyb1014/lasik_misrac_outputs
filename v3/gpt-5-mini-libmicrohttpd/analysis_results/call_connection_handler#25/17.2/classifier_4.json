  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a simple assignment (setting connection->in_access_handler = true) and does not call any function. Rule 17.2 would only be violated if call_connection_handler were invoked recursively (directly or indirectly) \u2014 for example if daemon->default_handler (or a function it calls) ended up calling call_connection_handler, causing indirect recursion."
