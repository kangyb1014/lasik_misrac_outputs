  "scenario": "The fragment is a macro invocation only; there is no direct or indirect call to call_connection_handler shown. Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated in the shown code. A violation would occur only if the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR macro expands to code that (directly or indirectly) re-enters call_connection_handler \u2014 for example, if the macro calls a function that queues a response or triggers daemon callbacks which call call_connection_handler. That expansion is not present here, so no violation can be concluded from this fragment."
