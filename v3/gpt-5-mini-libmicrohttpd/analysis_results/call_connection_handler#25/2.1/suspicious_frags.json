  "explanation": "All other statements in the function are ordinary assignments, initialisations and the call to daemon->default_handler; these are conditionally executed and can be reached depending on the runtime state, so they do not prima facie represent code that is impossible to execute. The fragments listed above should be investigated because they involve early returns and a macro invocation that may alter control flow (for example, the macro could itself contain a jump/exit/return), or produce redundant/duplicated statements \u2014 situations that can produce truly unreachable code. The remainder of the function (processed = 0; connection->rq.client_aware = true; connection->in_access_handler = true; the call to daemon->default_handler and its arguments) are reachable by normal control flow and hence do not require investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 in this snippet."
