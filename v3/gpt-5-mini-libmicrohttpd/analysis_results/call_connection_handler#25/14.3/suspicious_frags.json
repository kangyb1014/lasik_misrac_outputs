  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The two if conditions are runtime-dependent: (1) \"if (NULL != connection->rp.response)\" tests a pointer value that can change at runtime; (2) \"if (MHD_NO == daemon->default_handler(...))\" invokes a function pointer and compares its return \u2014 this is not a constant expression. There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
