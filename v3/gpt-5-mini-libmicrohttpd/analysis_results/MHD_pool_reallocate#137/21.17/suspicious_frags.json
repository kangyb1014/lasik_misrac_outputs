  "explanation": "Other code fragments were not included because they do not directly call the standard <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, or they are guarded by checks/assertions that constrain sizes/pointers relevant to those functions. Specifically:\n- The code performs explicit checks and assertions (e.g. shrinking determination, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE comparisons, pool->pos/pool->end bounds, and checks that asize fits in the pool) that are intended to ensure newly allocated blocks are large enough for requested sizes and that pointer arithmetic stays within the pool bounds.\n- The allocation-path calls _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY/_MHD_POISON_MEMORY which are sanitizer macros rather than standard <string.h> functions; these are outside the strict scope of Rule 21.17 (but could be reviewed separately if needed).\n- Pointer arithmetic and offset checks (mp_ptr_diff_, old_offset, and the various mhd_asserts) are included to prevent out-of-bounds accesses; these statements themselves do not invoke string.h functions and thus are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17.\nTherefore, only the explicit calls to memcpy/memset in the code are reported for investigation under Rule 21.17."
