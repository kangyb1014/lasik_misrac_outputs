  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. None of the function parameters (cls, key, key_size, value, value_size, kind) are assigned to or otherwise modified within this function. The code only: - reads cls and casts it to a local pointer variable (struct MHD_Connection *connection = (struct MHD_Connection *) cls;), which does not modify the parameter itself (it initializes a local variable). - passes parameters to MHD_set_connection_value_n and other functions and dereferences the connection pointer to access members. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter (e.g. connection->...) is permitted by the rule; the rule only prohibits changing the parameter variable itself. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
