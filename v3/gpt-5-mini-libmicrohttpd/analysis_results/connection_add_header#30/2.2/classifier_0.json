Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_add_header:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nconnection_add_header (void *cls,\n                       const char *key,\n                       size_t key_size,\n                       const char *value,\n                       size_t value_size,\n                       enum MHD_ValueKind kind)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *connection = (struct MHD_Connection *) cls;\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_set_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                  kind,\n                                  key,\n                                  key_size,\n                                  value,\n                                  value_size))\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in pool to allocate header record!\\n\"));\n#endif\n    transmit_error_response_static (connection,\n                                    MHD_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE,\n                                    ERR_MSG_REQUEST_TOO_BIG);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_set_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                  kind,\n                                  key,\n                                  key_size,\n                                  value,\n                                  value_size))\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No \u2014 based on the fragment as given there is no evidence of dead code. The call to MHD_set_connection_value_n affects control flow and error handling (allocation failure path) so removing it would change behaviour. A violation would occur only in a contrived/configuration case \u2014 for example, if MHD_set_connection_value_n is defined (by configuration or as an inline/macro) to be a no\u2011op that always returns MHD_YES and has no side effects, and any error handling routines called in the failure branch (e.g. transmit_error_response_static or logging) are also compiled out / are no\u2011ops; then the call and the conditional would be executed but their removal would not affect program behaviour, which would constitute dead code."
