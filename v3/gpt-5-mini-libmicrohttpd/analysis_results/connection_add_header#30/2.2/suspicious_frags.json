The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed need not be investigated here because they have clear observable effects or are essential control flow: the calls to transmit_error_response_static(...) and the function's return statements visibly alter program behaviour and thus cannot be dead code without changing behaviour. The function parameters key/key_size/value/value_size are passed to MHD_set_connection_value_n and therefore are used. The final \"return MHD_YES;\" is required for the function's contract. The selected fragments were chosen because they may be no-op in some builds or configurations (e.g. logging compiled out, the local pointer only used by such logging or by calls that themselves may be no-ops), and thus warrant investigation to determine whether they are executed yet removable without changing program behaviour (i.e. potential dead code under Rule 2.2)."
