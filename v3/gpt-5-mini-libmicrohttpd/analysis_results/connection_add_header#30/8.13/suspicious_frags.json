  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that could be const-qualified. The function parameter 'cls' (void *cls) and its immediate use (casting to struct MHD_Connection *) are suspicious because a pointer-to-const might be appropriate if the object is not modified. The call to MHD_set_connection_value_n and subsequent uses of 'connection' are included because they pass the connection pointer into other functions/macros where const-qualification may be relevant. Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the key and value parameters are already const-qualified (const char *), the size_t and enum parameters are non-pointer types, the return type is an enum (non-pointer), and the boolean checks/returns (MHD_NO / MHD_YES) are not pointer usages. Therefore no other lines present pointer-to-non-const situations that would be candidates for making the pointed-to type const."
