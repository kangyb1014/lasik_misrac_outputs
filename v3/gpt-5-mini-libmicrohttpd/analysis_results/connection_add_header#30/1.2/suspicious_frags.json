  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically checked and not present: 1) No GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__((...)), __builtin_* functions, __typeof__, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, or __extension__ markers. 2) No inline assembly or __asm__ usage. 3) No compiler-specific keywords (for example __inline, __restrict, __cdecl, __stdcall, etc.). 4) No reliance on nonstandard preprocessor features beyond simple #ifdef/#endif. 5) No use of nonstandard cast forms \u2014 the cast from void * to struct MHD_Connection * is standard C. 6) No use of compiler-specific pragmas or platform-specific annotations. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this code; nothing needs to be forwarded for investigation under this rule."
