Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected fragments that look potentially redundant, conditional-compile dependent, or intentionally inert and therefore worth inspection for dead-code concerns (for example the explicit \"if (1)\" wrappers, the conditional compilation branches that collapse case labels to a single \"return NULL\", and the preprocessor guarded arithmetic/assignment around connection timeout). Other parts of the function are standard runtime checks and assignments that clearly affect observable behaviour and therefore do not appear to be dead code: null-pointer checks (e.g. \"if (NULL == connection->tls_session) return NULL;\"), state checks before accessing request headers, the memcpy of client address guarded by addr_len, assignments to connection_info_dummy followed by returning its address, and the default/other case labels that return NULL. These runtime checks and returns change the function's externally visible behaviour and so are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
