  "explanation": "I identified and reported all code fragments that contain function or macro calls which could potentially lead to indirect recursion and thus require investigation for compliance with MISRA C Rule 17.2. Other parts of the function consist only of switch labels, conditional checks, direct assignments, literal returns (return NULL; or returning a pointer to a struct member), and simple arithmetic/casts; these do not invoke any functions and therefore cannot directly or indirectly call MHD_get_connection_info, so they do not need investigation for recursive calls."
