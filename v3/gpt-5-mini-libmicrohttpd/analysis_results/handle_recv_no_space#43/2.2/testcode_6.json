  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe switch includes an explicit case for MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE and a default that only contain a break, followed by mhd_assert(0). The top of the function has mhd_assert(MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE != stage) so in normal builds these labels are never expected to be taken; in debug builds the earlier assert prevents execution, and in release builds the assert may compile out so the case/default only execute a no-op break and control reaches the following mhd_assert(0) (which may also be a no-op). The case/default blocks therefore perform no meaningful action and removing them would not change program behaviour \u2014 they are redundant dead operations. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified handle_recv_no_space code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/432.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of handle_recv_no_space as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_recv_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_recv_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                      enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage stage)\n{\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT <= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS >= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_FULL_REQ_RECEIVED > c->state);\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_INIT == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_METHOD != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_URI != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HTTPVER != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_HEADERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE != stage); /* handle_req_cookie_no_space() must be called directly */\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_CHUNKED != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_FOOTERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (!
