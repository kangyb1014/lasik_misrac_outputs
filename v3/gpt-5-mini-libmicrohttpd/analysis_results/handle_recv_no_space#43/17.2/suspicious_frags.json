  "explanation": "I listed all call sites and the assertion that reference other handler functions (including the special-case comment about handle_req_cookie_no_space) present in handle_recv_no_space. These are the points where indirect recursion could originate (if any of the called functions call back into handle_recv_no_space). Other fragments in the function (mhd_assert checks that compare enums, switch/case labels, return statements, comments, and simple control-flow logic) do not perform function calls themselves and therefore cannot by themselves create direct or indirect self-calls; they do not need further investigation with respect to Rule 17.2. If any macro used here (e.g. mhd_assert or _) expands to function calls, those expansions should be inspected separately, but the explicit function-call sites above are the primary places to investigate for potential indirect recursion."
