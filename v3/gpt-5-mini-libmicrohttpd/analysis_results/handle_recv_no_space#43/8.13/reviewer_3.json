True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes c->read_buffer (a mutable buffer pointer) to handle_req_headers_no_space. If that function only reads the buffer, its parameter should be declared as const char * and the pointer should therefore point to a const-qualified type. Without the function prototype we cannot prove the parameter is const; as shown this is a potential violation: a non-const pointer is used where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate. If handle_req_headers_no_space already declares the parameter as const char * then there is no violation; otherwise this call (and/or the function's parameter type) violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is not provably correct given only the snippet. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns the declaration of pointer types (they should be const-qualified where possible). The call site in handle_recv_no_space passes c->read_buffer to handle_req_headers_no_space (and to a couple of other helpers), but the snippet does not show the prototype/definition of those functions nor the declaration type of c->read_buffer. Therefore you cannot determine from this translation-unit fragment whether a Rule 8.13 violation actually exists:\n\n- If handle_req_headers_no_space (and the other functions) declare their parameter as const char * (or another appropriate const-qualified pointer type), then there is no violation \u2014 passing a mutable char * to a const char * parameter is fine and preferable.\n- If those functions declare the parameter as char * (non-const) but do not modify the buffer, then their parameter should be changed to const char * and that would be a Rule 8.13 violation as Agent A suggests.\n- If those functions legitimately modify the buffer, then a non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no violation.\n\nConclusion: the agent\u2019s scenario describes a possible (plausible) violation but the evidence is insufficient to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 breach. To decide for sure, inspect the prototypes/definitions of handle_req_headers_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space and the declaration of c->read_buffer. If the functions do not modify the buffer, change their parameter types to const-qualified pointer types to comply with Rule 8.13."
