  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were not flagged because they do not introduce pointer-to-object usages where const qualification appears applicable from this snippet: - The many mhd_assert(...) checks and enum/integer comparisons operate on scalar fields of the connection or on enums, not on pointers requiring const qualification. - Calls that pass NULL or integer offsets (e.g. handle_req_headers_no_space(c, NULL, 0); and usages of read_buffer_offset) are not pointer objects that could be const-qualified here. - Most accesses to the connection object c (reads of c->state, c->rq.*) or passing c to other routines likely indicate the callee may modify the connection; thus declaring c as a pointer-to-const here would be inappropriate unless the callees' signatures also guarantee no modification. - String literals and macros producing string literals used in error reporting are inherently immutable and normally have const-qualified types; they do not require further investigation in this context. The listed fragments are the places where pointers (notably buffer pointers and the connection/daemon pointers) are passed around as non-const in situations where const qualification might be appropriate; these should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
