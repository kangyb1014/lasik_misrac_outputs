In other words, passing c->read_buffer to a callee that could/should have taken const char * but is declared with a non-const pointer constitutes a rule violation.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not established by the code shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is about using const in pointer declarations when the pointed-to object is not intended to be modified. The snippet only shows a caller passing c->read_buffer to various helper functions; it does not show those functions' declarations or whether they modify the buffer. The rule would be violated in the callee's declaration/implementation if a function parameter is declared as a non-const pointer yet the function does not (and need not) modify the pointed-to data. Passing a (non-const) buffer to a function is not by itself a Rule 8.13 violation \u2014 the relevant place to check is the callee prototype/implementation (or the declaration of the buffer itself in the struct) to see if const could/should be used. Therefore Agent A's claim cannot be confirmed from this code alone; it is only correct if the called functions are declared to take non-const pointers while not modifying the data. If the callees legitimately modify the buffer, then there is no violation."
