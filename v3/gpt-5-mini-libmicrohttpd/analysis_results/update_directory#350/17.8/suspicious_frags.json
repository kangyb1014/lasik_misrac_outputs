  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function update_directory has no formal parameters (it is defined as void), so there are no function parameters that could be modified inside this function. All assignments and modifications in this code operate on local variables (rdc, initial_allocation, dir_name, etc.) or on objects pointed to by pointers passed to other functions \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; only modifying the pointer parameter itself would be a violation. Calls in this function (e.g., list_directory(&rdc, dir_name), MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback(..., rdc.buf, ...)) pass pointers or objects but do not show any reassignment of a formal parameter within this function. Therefore, there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
