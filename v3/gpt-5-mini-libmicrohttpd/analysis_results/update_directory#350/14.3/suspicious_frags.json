  "explanation": "I found no loop controlling expressions that are invariant and hence no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- The outer for loop (for (language_idx = 0; NULL != languages[language_idx].dirname; language_idx++)) has a controlling expression that depends on language_idx which is updated by the loop \u2014 it is not invariant.\n- The inner for loop (for (category_idx = 0; NULL != categories[category_idx]; category_idx++)) similarly depends on category_idx which is updated \u2014 not invariant.\n- There are no while, do-while, or for(;;) constructs with constant controlling expressions (no intended infinite-loop idiom or constant false do-while present).\n- Other conditional statements (if tests) use values that can vary at runtime (results of malloc, snprintf, stat, buffer offsets, etc.) and are therefore not compile-time or loop-invariant controlling expressions.\n- Preprocessor conditional (#ifdef FORCE_CLOSE) is not a C controlling expression and is outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\n\nGiven the above, there are no suspicious controlling expressions to report for investigation under Rule 14.3."
