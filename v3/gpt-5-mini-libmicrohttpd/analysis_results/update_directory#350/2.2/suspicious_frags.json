  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that are likely redundant, potentially never effective, or otherwise warrant investigation for dead-code issues (checks/comments that assert a condition can never happen; writes that appear to overwrite earlier writes; static state that may be unused). Other code fragments were NOT flagged because they perform necessary runtime actions whose removal would change program behaviour: - The malloc() call and its NULL check (rdc.buf allocation) are required to handle allocation failure. - The stat() checks (e.g. if (0 != stat(...)) continue;) are necessary to skip non-existent directories and affect control flow. - The snprintf() that composes dir_name and its subsequent overflow/return-value checks (res and sizeof(dir_name) tests) are necessary to avoid buffer overflow and to handle formatting errors. - The checks and error handling around list_directory() (checking for MHD_NO, freeing buffer and returning) are necessary to propagate errors. - Creation of the response object (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback), mark_as_html(response), and update_cached_response(response) are functional operations that affect program behaviour. - The casts to (void) for ignoring return values and the #ifdef / #endif conditional block are conditional/intentional constructs (conditional compilation is not executed code when not defined and is not a dead-code concern per the MISRA note about unreachable code). These non-flagged fragments all have observable effects or are necessary runtime checks; their removal would change behaviour and therefore they are not candidates for investigation for Rule 2.2."
