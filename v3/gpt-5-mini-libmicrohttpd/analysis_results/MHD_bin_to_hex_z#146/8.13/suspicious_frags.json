  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the local declaration \"size_t res;\" and the final \"return res;\" are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. The only places that could involve const-qualification issues are the function's parameter declarations and the call to the external routine MHD_bin_to_hex (which may have a differing parameter const-qualification in its prototype). The rest of the code contains no additional pointer parameters or pointer usages that would affect Rule 8.13."
