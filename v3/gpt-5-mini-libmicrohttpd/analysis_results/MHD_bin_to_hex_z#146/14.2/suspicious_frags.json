First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the form of for statements (their three clauses, loop counter and loop-control flags, and modifications within the loop body). The provided function MHD_bin_to_hex_z contains no for statements or loop constructs at all \u2014 it only declares a size_t, calls MHD_bin_to_hex, assigns a nul terminator via hex[res] = 0, and returns res. Therefore there are no in-function for-loop fragments to inspect for Rule 14.2.\n\nNotes for reviewers: if the implementation of MHD_bin_to_hex (or a macro that expands into this call) contains for loops, those for loops would need to be inspected against Rule 14.2, but they are not present in the supplied code fragment. No other code in this function can be interpreted as a for statement, so no further fragments in this function are relevant to Rule 14.2."
