  "scenario": "No violation: the function MHD_bin_to_hex_z calls MHD_bin_to_hex (a different function) and does not call itself in the provided fragment. There is no evidence here of direct or indirect recursion; a violation would only occur if MHD_bin_to_hex (not shown) called MHD_bin_to_hex_z, which is not indicated."
