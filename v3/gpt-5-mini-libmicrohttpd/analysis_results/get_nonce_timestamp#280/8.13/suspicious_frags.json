  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the nonce parameter is declared as const char *const (the pointed-to type is already const-qualified), the use of strlen(nonce) and the pointer arithmetic (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN) only read from the const-qualified nonce, and there are no other pointer declarations in this function. Therefore the only places where a pointer points to a non-const-qualified type that could be relevant to Rule 8.13 are the ptimestamp parameter and its use when passed to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_."
