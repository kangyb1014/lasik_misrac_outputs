  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains only three if-statements: (1) if (0 == nonce_timeout) \u2014 this depends on the function parameter nonce_timeout and therefore is not an invariant compile-time/constant expression; (2) if (0 == max_nc) \u2014 likewise depends on the function parameter max_nc and is not invariant; (3) if (NULL != buf) \u2014 buf is initialized to NULL but is passed by address to digest_auth_check_all_inner and may be modified there, so the controlling expression is not invariant. There are no loops or other control constructs with constant conditions (e.g. while(1) or do { } while(0)) in this code fragment. Therefore no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 are present."
