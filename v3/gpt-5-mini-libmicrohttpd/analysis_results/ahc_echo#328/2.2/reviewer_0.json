  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's strict syntactic argument (that \u201c(void) cls;\u201d does nothing at runtime and removing it would not change program behaviour) is correct as an observation, but the report that this is a MISRA 2023 Rule 2.2 violation is not correct in practice. The (void)parameter; idiom is an explicit clue that the parameter is intentionally unused and is routinely employed to suppress compiler diagnostics. MISRA's prohibition of \u201cdead code\u201d is aimed at leftover/unused operations that indicate logic errors or unnecessary runtime activity; it is not intended to ban harmless annotations whose only effect is to document intent or silence diagnostics. Therefore this use of (void) cls; is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation in normal MISRA interpretation. If you need to avoid even the appearance of this issue in a strict audit, use an accepted mechanism for marking unused parameters (compiler attribute, a project-wide UNUSED_PARAM macro, or remove the parameter from the prototype where allowed)."
