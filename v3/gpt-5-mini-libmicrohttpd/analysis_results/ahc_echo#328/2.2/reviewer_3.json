  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) version;' (and the similar casts to void for other parameters) is an executed expression statement that has no side effects; removing it would not change the observable behaviour of the program as defined by the C abstract machine. Under the rule text supplied \u2014 \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d \u2014 this idiom is dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nNote: In some embedded contexts one might argue that the tiny change in execution timing caused by removing such statements could affect system behaviour; MISRA explicitly points out that timing can be part of behaviour. If timing effects are relevant here, then the statement might not be considered dead in that narrow sense. However, absent a demonstrated timing dependence, the (void) casts are semantically no-ops and are considered dead code by the rule. A safer conforming approach is to use compiler-supported attributes for unused parameters, omit the parameter name where the language and prototype permit, or use other project-approved mechanisms to suppress warnings rather than leaving no-op expression statements in the code."
