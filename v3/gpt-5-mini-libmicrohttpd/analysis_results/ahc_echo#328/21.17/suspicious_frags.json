  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> (and uses of those functions) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The two fragments above invoke string.h functions (strcmp and strlen) and therefore must be investigated to ensure their pointer arguments reference objects with sufficient bounds and are non-NULL where required. Other code in the function does not call any <string.h> routines: fopen(&url[1]) and subsequent file/stat calls are not string.h functions (so are outside Rule 21.17's direct scope), and other operations (fclose, fileno, fstat, S_ISREG, casts, MHD_* API calls) do not use string.h functions and thus do not need to be examined for this specific rule. Ensure investigators nevertheless verify the provenance and validity of pointers passed into the highlighted string functions (for example that 'method' and 'PAGE' are valid, null-terminated, and within bounds)."
