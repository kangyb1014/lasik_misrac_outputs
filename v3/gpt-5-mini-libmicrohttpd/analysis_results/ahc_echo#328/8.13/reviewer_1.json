True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function stores the address of a static int (aptr) into *req_cls where req_cls has type void **. The pointer value being stored therefore points to a non-const-qualified object. The code does not need to modify the object via that pointer, so according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type (for example the API would ideally use a pointer-to-const or aptr be const). As written (*req_cls = &aptr;) violates Rule 8.13. Note: if the external API mandates void ** this may be unavoidable, but the fragment as shown is a rule violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 8.13 requires that pointers be to const-qualified types where possible (i.e. when the object they point to is not modified via that pointer). In the function, req_cls has type void ** and the code does *req_cls = &aptr; so the stored pointer value points at a non-const object (static int aptr). The code never modifies aptr via that pointer, so the pointee could be const-qualified and therefore this use is non\u2011compliant with Rule 8.13.\n\nPractical note: the function signature (req_cls: void **) is provided by the external MHD callback API. That API prevents changing the parameter type here; consequently the only realistic remedies are either (a) obtain an API that allows const (e.g. const void **), (b) change the design so the stored object is mutable through the API, or (c) document and formally justify a deviation from MISRA because of the external API. Making aptr const would be semantically appropriate but would then require a corresponding const-qualified pointer type in the API (or an explicit cast, which would itself need justification)."
