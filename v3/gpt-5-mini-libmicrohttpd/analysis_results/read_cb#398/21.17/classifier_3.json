  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "compress_buf is called with &size (address of the caller-supplied buffer length). If compress_buf increases the value of size (or sets it larger than the original caller-provided buffer length for mem), the subsequent memcpy(mem, buf, size) will copy more bytes than mem can hold, causing accesses beyond object bounds and violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Without a documented guarantee that compress_buf will not enlarge size beyond the original buffer capacity, this call sequence constitutes a potential rule violation."
