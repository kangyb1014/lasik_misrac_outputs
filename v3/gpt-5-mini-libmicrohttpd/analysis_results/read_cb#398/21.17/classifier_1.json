  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The statement only casts the uint64_t pos to size_t; Rule 21.17 concerns uses of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.). This line does not call any such function and therefore cannot by itself cause accesses beyond object bounds. (Note: a truncation/narrowing of pos could cause a later out-of-bounds when that offset is used with memcpy, but that would be a separate concern, not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 by this fragment.)"
