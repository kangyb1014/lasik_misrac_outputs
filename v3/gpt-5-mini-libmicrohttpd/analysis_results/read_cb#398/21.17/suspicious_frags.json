  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments need further investigation with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 because they directly affect the parameters and buffers involved in the single use of a <string.h> function in this routine. The remaining code fragments are not relevant to this rule: declarations and simple assignments do not invoke string-handling functions; the check for pos against SSIZE_MAX and the cast to size_t prevent an invalid conversion of the pos parameter; the NULL check after allocation and the early-return on zero read prevent proceeding with invalid inputs; the final free(src) and return logic are standard resource-management and control-flow constructs. No other calls to <string.h> functions appear in the function, so there are no additional locations that need to be examined for accesses beyond object bounds under Rule 21.17."
