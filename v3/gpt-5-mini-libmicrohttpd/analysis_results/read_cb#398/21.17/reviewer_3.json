True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\ncompress_buf is called with &size (address of the caller-supplied buffer length). If compress_buf increases the value of size (or sets it larger than the original caller-provided buffer length for mem), the subsequent memcpy(mem, buf, size) will copy more bytes than mem can hold, causing accesses beyond object bounds and violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Without a documented guarantee that compress_buf will not enlarge size beyond the original buffer capacity, this call sequence constitutes a potential rule violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code passes &size to compress_buf, so compress_buf may modify the value of size. The memcpy copies 'size' bytes into mem where mem\u2019s capacity is the original caller-supplied size parameter. If compress_buf increases size (or sets it larger than the original buffer capacity), the memcpy(mem, buf, size) can write beyond mem\u2019s bounds, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. To be compliant you must either ensure by contract/inspection that compress_buf cannot increase size beyond the original capacity, or use a separate variable for the resulting length and explicitly check that it does not exceed the original buffer size before calling memcpy."
