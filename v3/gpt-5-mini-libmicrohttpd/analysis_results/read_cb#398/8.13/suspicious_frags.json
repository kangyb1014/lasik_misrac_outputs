  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they involve objects that are written to or are non-pointer entities: - src (allocated and then filled by fread) is a writable buffer; it cannot/should not be const-qualified. - mem is used as the destination of memcpy (written to), so it must be a non-const pointer. - The fread() call requires a void* target (writable). - Variables like offset, r_size, size, pos, ret are non-pointer scalar types and not relevant to pointer const-qualification. - malloc()/free()/fread()/memcpy() usage is consistent with mutable buffers where applicable. These items therefore do not need further inspection for adding const qualifiers under Rule 8.13."
