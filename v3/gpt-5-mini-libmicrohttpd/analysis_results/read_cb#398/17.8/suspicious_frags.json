  "explanation": "The only parameter that is potentially modified is the parameter 'size'. The function prototype is included to show that 'size' is a value parameter. The call to compress_buf takes &size, which allows the callee to modify the parameter object itself \u2014 this is exactly the situation Rule 17.8 prohibits (a function parameter should not be modified). Other fragments do not modify function parameters: assigning holder = cls only copies the pointer value into a local variable (does not modify the parameter); offset = (size_t) pos assigns to a local 'offset' (pos is not modified); malloc/fread operate on local 'src'; memcpy(mem, buf, size) writes to the object pointed to by 'mem' (allowed \u2014 the pointer may be used to modify the pointed-to object, but the pointer itself is not altered); free() calls operate on local variables. Therefore no other lines need investigation for Rule 17.8."
