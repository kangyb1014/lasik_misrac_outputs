  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of read_cb:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nread_cb (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *mem, size_t size)\n{\n  struct Holder *holder = cls;\n  void *src;\n  void *buf;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t offset;\n  size_t r_size;\n\n  if (pos > SSIZE_MAX)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  offset = (size_t) pos;\n  src = malloc (size);\n  if (NULL == src)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  r_size = fread (src, 1, size, holder->file);\n  if (0 == r_size)\n  {\n    ret = (0 != ferror (holder->file)) ?\n          MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR : MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;\n    goto done;\n  }\n  if (MHD_YES != compress_buf (&holder->stream, src, r_size, &offset, &buf,\n                               &size, holder->buf))\n    ret = MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  else\n  {\n    memcpy (mem, buf, size);\n    ret = (ssize_t) size;\n  }\n  free (buf); /* Buf may be set even on error return. */\ndone:\n  free (src);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemcpy (mem, buf, size);\n    ret = (ssize_t) size;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The memcpy and the assignment to ret are executed when compress_buf indicates success; removing them would change the observable behaviour (the supplied buffer would not be filled and the return value would not indicate the number of bytes copied). Therefore these operations are not dead code."
