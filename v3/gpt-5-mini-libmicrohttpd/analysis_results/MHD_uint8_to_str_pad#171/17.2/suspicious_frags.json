  "explanation": "No other function calls appear in the body of MHD_uint8_to_str_pad. The remaining statements are arithmetic, assignments, buffer indexing, casts and returns, none of which can introduce direct or indirect calls. There are no function-pointer dereferences, no calls to other functions, and the function does not call MHD_uint8_to_str_pad itself. Therefore the only fragment that could lead to indirect recursion (and must be investigated) is the mhd_assert invocation, which may be a function or macro that could call back into this function. All other fragments do not require investigation with respect to Rule 17.2."
