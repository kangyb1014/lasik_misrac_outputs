  "explanation": "No uses of <string.h> functions are present in the supplied function (no memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn etc.), so Rule 21.17 (which applies specifically to the standard string handling functions) has no direct application here. Additionally, buffer writes are guarded: an early check returns when buf_size == 0, and before each subsequent digit write the code checks if (buf_size <= pos) and returns if there is no space remaining. Thus there are no obvious code fragments in this function that could cause accesses beyond the buffer bounds via standard <string.h> calls or via unguarded writes. Consequently no fragments require further investigation for Rule 21.17."
