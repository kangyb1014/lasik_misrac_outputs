First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements. A full scan of the function shows there are no for statements present, nor any while/do-while loops that would be relevant to this rule. Therefore there are no explicit for-loop fragments to investigate. The only potential source of a hidden for statement would be macro expansion: mhd_assert is the only macro-like construct used in this function and could, in theory, expand to code containing a for loop. Because the body text of that macro is not available here, the mhd_assert line is reported for investigation. All other lines (if/return statements, arithmetic, casts, and direct function code) contain no for statements and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.2."
