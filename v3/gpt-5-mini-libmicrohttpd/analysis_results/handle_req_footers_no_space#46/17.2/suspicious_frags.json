  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call in this function body, so the only way Rule 17.2 could be violated here is via indirect recursion through functions invoked by this function. The (void) casts for add_footer and add_footer_size, the comment, and the direct access of c->rq.have_chunked_upload are not function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion. The static qualification and the function signature themselves do not constitute a call. Thus the only fragments that merit investigation for possible indirect recursion are the calls to mhd_assert and transmit_error_response_static (and, if desired, the function definition to track call sites). Other lines do not call functions and can be excluded from recursion-focused investigation."
