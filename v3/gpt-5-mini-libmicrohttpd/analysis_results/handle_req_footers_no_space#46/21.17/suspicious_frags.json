  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function. The code does not call any functions from <string.h> (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), it does not perform any pointer arithmetic or buffer copies, and the parameters add_footer and add_footer_size are explicitly marked unused with (void) casts (so there is no access via those pointers/values here). The only operations are an assertion (mhd_assert) and a call to transmit_error_response_static; neither invokes any string.h function within this fragment. If transmit_error_response_static or other functions called here use string.h functions, those implementations are outside the provided snippet and should be inspected separately, but there is no direct string-handling usage in the shown code to warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17."
