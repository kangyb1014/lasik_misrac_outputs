Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other parts of the function are control-structure or necessary operations and do not look like dead code on their face. The function header, parameter list and return type are required; the calls to the helper functions (post_process_urlencoded/post_process_multipart) perform actual processing and have observable effects (so their bodies must be considered live); the macro invocations and string-literal length computations are part of the decision logic and cannot be assumed redundant without broader context. The comment and the function braces are non-executable or syntactic. Therefore only the listed fragments need investigation for potential dead-code violations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
