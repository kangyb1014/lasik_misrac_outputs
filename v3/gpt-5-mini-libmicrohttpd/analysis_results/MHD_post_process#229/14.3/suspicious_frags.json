  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Each conditional depends on function parameters or on the result of a runtime function call:\n- if (0 == post_data_len) depends on the runtime parameter post_data_len.\n- if (NULL == pp) depends on the runtime parameter pp.\n- The two if statements that call MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ depend on pp->encoding and on the runtime result of that function (not a compile-time constant).\nThere are no while/for/do-while loops or constant-true/constant-false if expressions (e.g. if (1) or if (0)) that would trigger Rule 14.3 concerns or require the listed exceptions for infinite loops or do-while constant false. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
