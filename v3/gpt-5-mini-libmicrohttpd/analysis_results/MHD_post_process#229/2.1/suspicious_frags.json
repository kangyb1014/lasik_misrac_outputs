  "explanation": "The other code fragments do not indicate unreachable code and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the early \"if (0 == post_data_len) return MHD_YES;\" is an intentional early-exit when there is no data; the \"if (NULL == pp) return MHD_NO;\" is a normal null-pointer guard; the function signature and surrounding braces are structural and not related to reachability. The only potential reachability concern is that the function assumes pp->encoding will match one of the two handled encodings\u2014so the two encoding-check branches and the final \"this should never be reached\" fallback return should be investigated."
