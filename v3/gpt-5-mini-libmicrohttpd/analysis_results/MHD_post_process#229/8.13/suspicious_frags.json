  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not raise concerns under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: post_data is already declared as const char *, so it is correctly const-qualified; post_data_len is a scalar size_t (not a pointer) and therefore not subject to this rule; the early-return checks (if (0 == post_data_len) and if (NULL == pp)) are control-flow/validation and not pointer-type issues; the string constants and macros (MHD_HTTP_POST_ENCODING_*, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) represent constant data and are appropriately used as constant inputs. The only potential const-qualification issues are with the pointer to the post-processor object (pp) and uses of its encoding member passed to comparison functions \u2014 these are listed above for investigation because they might be candidates for const-qualification or may legitimately require mutability (which callers should justify)."
