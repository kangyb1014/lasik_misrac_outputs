  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to any parameter variables (pp, post_data, post_data_len) nor any increment/decrement operations on them.\n- The code only performs comparisons (if checks) and passes the parameters to other functions; passing parameters by value does not modify the parameters in this function.\n- Dereferencing pp (pp->encoding) only reads the object pointed to; Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer itself \u2014 and the pointer variable pp is not altered here.\n- No const casts, address-takings that would reassign parameters, or other operations that would change parameter values are present.\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
