  "scenario": "The call passes the local buffer 'buf' (unsigned char[]) to ws_receive_frame. If ws_receive_frame only reads from the buffer (i.e. does not modify it) then its parameter should be declared as const unsigned char * (and similarly the returned 'msg' should be a pointer to const data if it is only read). Having non-const pointer types in the declaration/usage when the data is not modified violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Concretely: if ws_receive_frame is declared to accept/return unsigned char * rather than const-qualified pointers while it does not write to the data, that is a Rule 8.13 violation.)"
