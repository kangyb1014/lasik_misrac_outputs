  "explanation": "No other calls to the Standard Library string functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. Other operations \u2014 recv into a fixed-size buffer using sizeof(buf), malloc/free/checks, make_blocking, pthread mutex operations, updating CLIENT_SOCKS, and MHD_upgrade_action \u2014 do not invoke the <string.h> string-handling functions and therefore are not directly relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17. The listed fragments should be investigated because they involve forming/consuming C-strings (msg used with \"%s\" in snprintf, computing a length via snprintf(NULL,0), sending text using a computed size, and freeing msg) and so could lead to out-of-bounds reads if msg is not a properly null-terminated buffer or if its lifetime/ownership differs (e.g. points into buf). Other lines in the function do not exhibit these risks and thus need not be investigated for this specific rule."
