  "explanation": "Only the while (1) controlling expression is an invariant in this function and therefore should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (the infinite-loop exception may apply). All other controlling expressions are data- or function-call-dependent and are not invariant at compile time, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.3: if (0 >= got), if (NULL == msg), if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME), if (0 < buf_size), if (NULL != text), if (snprintf (text, (size_t) buf_size + 1, ...) == buf_size), if (-1 == sent), if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME), for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++), if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX)), and if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX)) all depend on runtime values or loop index changes and therefore are not invariant controlling expressions."
