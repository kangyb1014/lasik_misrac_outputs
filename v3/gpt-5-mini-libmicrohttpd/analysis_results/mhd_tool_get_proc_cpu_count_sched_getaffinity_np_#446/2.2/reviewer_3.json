Removing the 'if (1)' and leaving the block unchanged would not alter program behaviour, therefore the evaluation of the constant condition is dead code.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA R2.2 forbids dead code in the project as a whole \u2014 i.e. operations that are executed but whose removal would never affect program behaviour. The \u2018if (1)\u2019 in this function is not merely an accidental constant-true test in isolation: it is used to combine with the surrounding #if/#endif construct so that the block serves both as the fallback path when the HAVE_SYSCONF branch is absent and as the else/else-if branch when that branch is present. In other words, across different build configurations the presence and role of that conditional matter. Removing the construct from the source (or changing how the preprocessor boundaries are written) can change the control-flow structure for some configurations. Therefore the conditional is not dead code in the sense of R2.2. (It might be considered stylistically awkward or could trigger other rules about constant expressions, but it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
