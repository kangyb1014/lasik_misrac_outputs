  "explanation": "Only the above fragment contains an invariant controlling expression (if (1)) that should be investigated under Rule 14.3. Other controlling expressions in the function are not invariant at runtime: - if (NULL != cpuset_ptr) depends on the result of cpuset_create() at runtime. - if (0 == sched_getaffinity_np(...)) depends on the return value of a runtime system call. - if (0 < sc_value) and if (0 < max_num) depend on sysconf() results and derived values. - for (cpu_num = 0; cpu_num < max_num; ++cpu_num) has a loop bound determined by max_num. - if (0 < cpuset_isset(...)) and the do-while condition while (0 <= res) depend on the runtime value of cpuset_isset and the variable res updated inside the loop. - The NetBSD-specific if (0 == ret) depends on ret computed earlier. - The final if (0 >= ret) depends on ret. Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) are compile-time, not runtime controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. Therefore they need not be investigated for invariant controlling expressions."
