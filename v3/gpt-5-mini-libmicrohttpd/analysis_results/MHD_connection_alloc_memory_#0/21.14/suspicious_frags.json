  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided function performs memory pool allocation and buffer resizing only; there are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any other standard-library string comparison functions, nor any manual byte-by-byte comparisons of character buffers that would indicate use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. All operations use size_t arithmetic and pointer assignments for buffers, so Rule 21.14 (prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any code in this fragment."
