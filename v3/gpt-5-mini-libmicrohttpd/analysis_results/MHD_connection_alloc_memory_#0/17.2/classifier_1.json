  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment invokes mhd_assert to check a condition; it does not call MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (the containing function) directly or indirectly, so there is no recursion. Only if mhd_assert were implemented to call back into MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (which is not indicated here) would Rule 17.2 be violated."
