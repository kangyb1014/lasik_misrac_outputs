  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The code contains no loops with constant conditions (no while/for/do-while with constant controlling expressions) and the conditional statements (if / else if / else) use values that are runtime-dependent: e.g. res (set by MHD_pool_try_alloc), need_to_be_freed (set by that call), and calls such as MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace which depend on the pool and buffer state. The mhd_assert calls are not controlling statements. The exceptions to Rule 14.3 (infinite loops or permitted do-while constant false) are not applicable. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
