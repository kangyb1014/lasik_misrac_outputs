  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs a size_t arithmetic comparison and does not call any functions from <string.h>. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of the string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.), so it is not applicable here. (Note: as an unrelated remark, if c->write_buffer_append_offset > c->write_buffer_size this subtraction would underflow and could lead to later out-of-bounds accesses \u2014 that would be a separate correctness/safety issue but not a direct violation of Rule 21.17.)"
