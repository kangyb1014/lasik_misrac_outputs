  "explanation": "I examined the function parameters and their usage with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are: (struct MHD_Connection *connection, size_t size). There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves (no statements like connection = ... or size = ...), and no pointer arithmetic or reassignments that modify those parameter variables. The code creates local aliases: 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;' and 'struct MemoryPool *const pool = c->pool;'. Both aliases are declared as const pointers (pointer value not modifiable) and the code never modifies those alias variables. The modifications present in the function are to members of the object pointed to by 'connection' (for example c->write_buffer_size, c->write_buffer, c->read_buffer_size, etc.), which is explicitly allowed by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). All other local variables (need_to_be_freed, res, buf, new_buf_size) are local and can be modified. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under that rule."
