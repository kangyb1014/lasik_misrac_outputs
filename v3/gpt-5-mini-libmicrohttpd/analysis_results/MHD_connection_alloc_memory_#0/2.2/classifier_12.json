  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_alloc_memory_:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              size_t size)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /* a short alias */\n  struct MemoryPool *const pool = c->pool;     /* a short alias */\n  size_t need_to_be_freed = 0; /**< The required amount of additional free memory */\n  void *res;\n\n  res = MHD_pool_try_alloc (pool,\n                            size,\n                            &need_to_be_freed);\n  if (NULL != res)\n    return res;\n\n  if (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (pool,\n                                     c->write_buffer,\n                                     c->write_buffer_size))\n  {\n    if (c->write_buffer_size - c->write_buffer_append_offset >=\n        need_to_be_freed)\n    {\n      char *buf;\n      const size_t new_buf_size = c->write_buffer_size - need_to_be_freed;\n      buf = MHD_pool_reallocate (pool,\n                                 c->write_buffer,\n                                 c->write_buffer_size,\n                                 new_buf_size);\n      mhd_assert (c->write_buffer == buf);\n      mhd_assert (c->write_buffer_append_offset <= new_buf_size);\n      mhd_assert (c->write_buffer_send_offset <= new_buf_size);\n      c->write_buffer_size = new_buf_size;\n      c->write_buffer = buf;\n    }\n    else\n      return NULL;\n  }\n  else if (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (pool,\n                                          c->read_buffer,\n                                          c->read_buffer_size))\n  {\n    if (c->read_buffer_size - c->read_buffer_offset >= need_to_be_freed)\n    {\n      char *buf;\n      const size_t new_buf_size = c->read_buffer_size - need_to_be_freed;\n      buf = MHD_pool_reallocate (pool,\n                                 c->read_buffer,\n                                 c->read_buffer_size,\n                                 new_buf_size);\n      mhd_assert (c->read_buffer == buf);\n      mhd_assert (c->read_buffer_offset <= new_buf_size);\n      c->read_buffer_size = new_buf_size;\n      c->read_buffer = buf;\n    }\n    else\n      return NULL;\n  }\n  else\n    return NULL;\n  res = MHD_pool_allocate (pool, size, true);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != res); /* It has been checked that pool has enough space */\n  return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconst size_t new_buf_size = c->write_buffer_size - need_to_be_freed;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The variable new_buf_size is used later in this block (passed to MHD_pool_reallocate, checked by asserts, and assigned to c->write_buffer_size). Removing the declaration/initialization would change program behaviour, so this is not dead code. (A violation would occur if new_buf_size were computed but never used \u2014 e.g. declared and initialized but never referenced afterwards.)"
