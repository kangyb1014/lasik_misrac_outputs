The assert only evaluates a condition and (assuming the macro has no side effects or is compiled out in production) its presence does not affect program behaviour; removing it would not change behaviour. Therefore this is dead code and violates Rule 2.2. (If mhd_assert can perform observable actions beyond the check\u2014e.g. logging or aborting in release builds\u2014then it would not be dead; the verdict above assumes the usual side\u2011effect\u2011free/assert\u2011compiled\u2011out behaviour.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. The mhd_assert(NULL != res) is an assertion macro; in builds where assertions are enabled it has observable behaviour (logging/abort) and its removal would change program behaviour, so it is not dead. Even if the expression itself has no side effects, the assertion can alter control flow/timing/diagnostics. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 here removal would affect behaviour in assertion-enabled builds. Only if, for the whole project and every build configuration, mhd_assert is defined as an absolute no-op (no side-effects, never executed) could it be considered dead; that project-specific fact is not provided. Therefore the reported violation is not justified without evidence that the macro is permanently inert in the project."
