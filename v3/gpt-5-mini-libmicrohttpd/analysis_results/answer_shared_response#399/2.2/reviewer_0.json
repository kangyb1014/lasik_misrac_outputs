It has no side effects and removing it would not change program behaviour, therefore it is an executed operation that constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The statement (void)cls; is an executed expression statement with no side effects; removing it would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2. (The same applies to the other (void) url; (void) version; ... lines.)\n\nNotes and mitigations: if the parameter were volatile or its evaluation had side effects then the cast-to-void could be meaningful; that is not the case here. Common remedies are to omit the parameter name where a prototype/declaration allows it, mark the parameter with a compiler-specific \"unused\" attribute, or document an approved deviation from MISRA for this idiom. Alternatively introduce a macro (e.g. PARAM_UNUSED(x)) that expands in a compliant, reviewed way. Any of these approaches avoids leaving a no-op expression statement that would be classified as dead code under Rule 2.2."
