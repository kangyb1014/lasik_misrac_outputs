  "explanation": "The function signature and the two code sites where the handler registers request state and where it calls into the MHD library are included because indirect recursion could occur via the library invoking the same callback again (e.g. the library calling the handler as part of queuing/sending a response or on subsequent events). Other lines in the function do not warrant investigation for Rule 17.2: simple calls to strcmp and the early return that rejects unsupported methods cannot cause the function to call itself; the (void) casts and variable declarations are inert; use of the volatile/static counter (last_index) and the modulo computation do not invoke any functions that could re-enter the handler. Thus only the handler declaration/registration block and the call into the MHD API need further investigation for potential indirect self-calls."
