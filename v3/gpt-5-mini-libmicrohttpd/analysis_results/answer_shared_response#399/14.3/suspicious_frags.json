  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Specifically:\n- The if (NULL == *req_cls) test depends on the runtime value of *req_cls and is not a compile-time constant.\n- The compound if ((0 != strcmp (method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && (0 != strcmp (method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD))) depends on the runtime contents of method (via strcmp) and is not invariant.\n- There are no for/while/do-while loops or other controlling constructs that use constant expressions; thus none of the rule exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the do-while constant-false exception) apply or are needed.\n- Other expressions (initializations of static variables, the resp_index assignment using volatile last_index and num_resps, and return statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
