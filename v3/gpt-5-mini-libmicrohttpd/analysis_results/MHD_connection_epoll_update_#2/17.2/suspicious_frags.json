  "explanation": "I flagged all function-call expressions and other operations that could lead to indirect invocation of MHD_connection_epoll_update_ (either by invoking callbacks or by performing operations that might trigger the daemon/event loop). The remaining code fragments are simple assignments, bitwise operations, struct initialization, control-flow statements, enum/constant uses, or return statements (for example: setting event.events, event.data.ptr = connection, connection->epoll_state |= ..., the various if/condition expressions, and the final return MHD_YES). Those do not invoke other functions and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2. If any of the listed function-like macros/Calls (included above) are actually implemented as macros expanding to further function calls, those expansions should be inspected as well \u2014 they are already included in the flagged fragments where they appear."
