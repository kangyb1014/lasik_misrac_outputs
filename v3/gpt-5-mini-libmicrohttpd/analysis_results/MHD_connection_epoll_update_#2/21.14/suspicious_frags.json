  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for any use of the Standard Library memcmp (or similar string-comparison functions) and found none. All comparisons are integer/bitmask tests (e.g. & and == on event_loop_info and epoll_state), assignments are to integer/enum fields, and the only standard-library-like call is epoll_ctl and a logging call that uses %s to print an error string \u2014 neither uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
