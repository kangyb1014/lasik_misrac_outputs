  "explanation": "I did not include other code fragments because they do not present additional potential violations of Rule 8.13: - The function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' is used to modify connection members (writes to epoll_state, state, and calls to cleanup_connection), so the pointed-to type cannot be const. - Assignments and updates to connection->epoll_state and connection->state clearly modify the pointee, so const-qualification is not appropriate. - Local object declarations (e.g. 'struct epoll_event event;') are non-pointer objects and not subject to the rule. - Bitwise tests/conditions and macro calls (mhd_assert, MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_) do not introduce additional pointer declarations that could be const-qualified. - Calls that clearly require a mutable argument (cleanup_connection, EDLL_insert \u2014 EDLL_insert is included above because its arguments are pointer expressions that should be reviewed) or standard APIs where the parameter semantics imply modification or require non-const pointers have been omitted from further reporting. The four fragments listed are those in this function that involve pointers (declaration, assignments, or API calls taking pointer arguments) where const-qualification of the pointed-to type could plausibly be applied and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
