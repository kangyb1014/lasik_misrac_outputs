  "explanation": "I have not flagged other fragments because they perform observable state changes or calls with likely side effects (e.g. MHD_connection_handle_read, MHD_connection_handle_write, MHD_connection_close_, setting connection/daemon fields, or returning immediately). Removing those operations would almost certainly change program behaviour, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. The selected fragments are ones where the stored value or the assignment itself appears potentially redundant (e.g. initialisation of 'ret' and multiple assignments to 'ret' that can be overwritten before use), or where code is conditional on debug-only macros (mhd_assert) or optional features (HTTPS_SUPPORT) and therefore merit investigation to ensure no executed operations are effectively redundant in build configurations. Other lines (state checks, bitmask tests, function calls that update state) were not included because they have clear runtime effects and are unlikely to be removable without affecting behaviour."
