  "explanation": "Two compilation errors were fixed:\n\n1) The code attempted to cast a struct (con->tid) directly to (void *). Casting a struct value to a pointer is invalid. I changed the fprintf to print the address of the tid object: (void *)&con->tid. This provides a pointer suitable for %p without casting the struct itself.\n\n2) The code referenced con->tls_read_ready in the log fprintf, but that member may not be present depending on build configuration. To make the translation unit compile safely, I introduced a local tls_read_ready_val and populated it under an #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT. The fprintf prints tls_read_ready_val, avoiding a direct unconditional dereference of con->tls_read_ready.\n\nAdditionally, to make this code a self-contained, compilable translation unit for testing, I provided minimal type definitions, constants, and function prototypes that the functions here reference (structs, enums and prototypes). These are declarations only (no mock implementations) so the file compiles without linking. The original logic of call_handlers is preserved."
