  "explanation": "I inspected the function for places where formal parameters are modified. The only parameter assignment found is the read_ready assignment above (reported). There are no assignments to write_ready or force_close, and the pointer parameter con is never reassigned (no \"con = ...\"), only its pointee fields are accessed/modified (e.g. con->... and calls like MHD_connection_handle_*), which is allowed by the rule. Local variables (ret, states_info_processed, on_fasttrack) are used/modified as expected. Therefore other code fragments do not violate Rule 17.8 and do not need further investigation."
