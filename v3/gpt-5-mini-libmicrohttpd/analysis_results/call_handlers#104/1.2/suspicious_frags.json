  "explanation": "I inspected the entire call_handlers function and found no explicit compiler-specific language extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n\n- No use of compiler-specific attributes or keywords such as __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, __asm, __inline__ (nonstandard forms), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, or other known vendor extensions.\n- No nested functions (a GCC extension), labels-as-values (&&label), or other GCC/Clang-specific constructs are present.\n- No inline assembly, pragmas that imply extensions, or use of nonstandard storage-class specifiers are present.\n- The use of bool/true/false is standard C99 (stdbool.h) and not a compiler extension; conditional compilation via #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT and the mhd_assert macro usage (including the backslash line continuations) are standard preprocessor features, not extensions.\n- All operators, control structures, and function definitions shown are standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that explicitly use compiler-documented language extensions and require further investigation under Rule 1.2."
