  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The controlling expression of the if contains the compile-time constant subexpression (sizeof(uint64_t) > sizeof(off_t)). When sizeof(uint64_t) <= sizeof(off_t) that subexpression is a constant false; because it is the left operand of && the whole controlling expression is therefore an invariant false (the right-hand comparisons can never be reached). MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions and none of the stated exceptions (infinite loops or the specific do-while case) applies here. The preprocessor guard only controls inclusion of the whole if-block; if the block is compiled in, the if's controlling expression can be invariant and so this is a violation."
