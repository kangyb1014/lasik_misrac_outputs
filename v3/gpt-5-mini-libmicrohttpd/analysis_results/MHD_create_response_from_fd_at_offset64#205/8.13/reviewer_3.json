If crc_cls is already declared as a pointer to const or the code later needs to modify the response via crc_cls, then there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The violation (if any) depends on how the member crc_cls is declared and used, which is not shown in the snippet. The mere assignment response->crc_cls = response; is not by itself a Rule 8.13 violation. If crc_cls is declared as non-const (e.g. `struct MHD_Response *crc_cls;`) but in all places it is only used to read the pointed-at object (no writes through that pointer), then the declaration should be `const struct MHD_Response *crc_cls;` and the non-const declaration would be a violation of Rule 8.13. Conversely, if crc_cls is already declared as a pointer-to-const, or if the code later writes through crc_cls (i.e. needs a non-const pointer), then there is no violation. Conclusion: you cannot determine a violation from this function alone \u2014 the report is not definitively correct without inspecting the member declaration and its uses."
