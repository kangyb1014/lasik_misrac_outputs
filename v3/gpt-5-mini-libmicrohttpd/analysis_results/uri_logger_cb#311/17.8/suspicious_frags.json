  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters are: (void *cls) and (const char *uri). Both are only cast to void to suppress unused warnings and are not assigned to or altered. The pointer parameter itself is not modified (no assignments to cls or uri). The only pointer that is assigned is the local variable tv, which points to newly allocated memory; gettimeofday(tv, NULL) modifies the object pointed to by tv (allowed by MISRA Rule 17.8 because the rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter, and here tv is a local pointer, not a function parameter). Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation with respect to that rule."
