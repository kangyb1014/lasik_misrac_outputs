  "explanation": "No code fragment requires investigation for Rule 17.2. The function uri_logger_cb does not call itself directly and contains no calls to other user-defined functions that could form an indirect recursion: it only calls malloc and gettimeofday (standard library/system functions that do not call back into this function). The function parameters are unused (cast to void), there are no function-pointer invocations, and the function has internal linkage (static), so there is no evidence in this fragment of direct or indirect self-calling. Therefore no fragments need further inspection for Rule 17.2 based on the provided code."
