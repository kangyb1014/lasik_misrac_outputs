  "explanation": "I inspected all controlling expressions in the function. The following are the only controlling expressions present: the three mhd_assert(...) usages, the if (0 != free_size) { ... } branch, and the nested if (c->write_buffer_send_offset == c->write_buffer_append_offset) { ... } branch. None of these are compile-time/invariant controlling expressions:\n\n- mhd_assert(...) invocations use runtime fields (c->write_buffer, c->write_buffer_size, offsets). Even if mhd_assert is implemented with a do { ... } while(0) macro, that do-while uses the constant 0 intentionally as a macro wrapper; MISRA explicitly permits a do-while with a controlling expression that is an integer constant expression evaluating to false (exception 2), and also the do{...}while(0) idiom does not create an invariant controlling expression in the user code logic.\n\n- if (0 != free_size) depends on free_size returned by MHD_pool_get_free(pool) (a runtime value), so it is not invariant.\n\n- if (c->write_buffer_send_offset == c->write_buffer_append_offset) depends on runtime-modifiable structure members and thus is not invariant.\n\nThere are no loops with invariant conditions (no while/for/do-while that create infinite loops except possible macro wrapping explained above), and no controlling expression is a compile-time constant used as part of program control flow. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
