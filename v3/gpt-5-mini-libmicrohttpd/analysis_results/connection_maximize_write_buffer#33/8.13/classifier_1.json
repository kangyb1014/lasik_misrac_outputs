  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when possible. The fragment only performs pointer comparisons; it does not declare a pointer. Moreover, c->write_buffer and new_buf are used for a writable buffer (reallocation and write operations), so qualifying them as pointers to const would be inappropriate. Therefore this code does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
