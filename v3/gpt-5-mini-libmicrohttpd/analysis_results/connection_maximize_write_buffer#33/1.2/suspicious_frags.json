  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no tokens or constructs that are known compiler extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords).\n- The backslashes seen are preprocessor line-continuation characters used to split a macro invocation across lines \u2014 this is standard C preprocessing, not a compiler extension.\n- The /**< comment is a C-style comment (often used by Doxygen) and is not a language extension.\n- Pointer/const syntax, static function scope, size_t, and the other language constructs used are all standard C.\n\nNote: macros or functions referenced here (mhd_assert, MHD_pool_reallocate, MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace, MHD_pool_get_free) are only invoked; their definitions are not shown. If those definitions contain compiler-specific extensions, those definitions should be inspected separately. Based solely on the shown code, there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
