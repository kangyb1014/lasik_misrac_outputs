  "scenario": "The single assignment c->write_buffer = new_buf; itself does not call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not directly cause out-of-bounds accesses. In this function the code updates c->write_buffer_size immediately after the assignment and contains assertions ensuring either the buffer was reallocated in-place or the previous buffer was NULL, so under correct implementation of MHD_pool_reallocate this assignment is safe. A possible violation scenario (hypothetical) would be if MHD_pool_reallocate incorrectly returned a pointer to a smaller region (or new_size were not applied) and later code used string functions (e.g. memcpy(c->write_buffer + append_offset, src, n)) where n exceeds the actual capacity \u2014 that would violate Rule 21.17."
