  "explanation": "I found no unreachable code in the provided function. Control flow is straightforward: the static data (page_content and page_content_len) are compile-time data and always available; the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static can return NULL and that case is handled by the immediate return (this is a reachable, valid conditional return, not dead code). All other statements (adding the header, queuing the response, destroying the response, returning ret) are reachable in the non-NULL resp path. There are no constant false/true conditionals, no code after an unconditional return, no infinite loops with trailing code, and no preprocessor constructs shown that would make sections unreachable. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
