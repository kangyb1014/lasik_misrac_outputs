Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining statements appear to be essential to the visible behaviour of the function and therefore are not flagged: the static page_content array is the payload used to build the response; the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static(...) produces the response object used later and the subsequent NULL check and return (if creation failed) are necessary to handle error conditions; the call to MHD_queue_response(c, MHD_HTTP_FORBIDDEN, resp) is the operation that actually sends the response and influences program behaviour, and returning the stored enum value (ret) propagates the result. These operations have observable effects (response creation/queuing, error handling and return values) and so are not likely to be dead code and do not require investigation under Rule 2.2."
