  "explanation": "No calls to any of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The only manipulation of a string object is the static initialization of page_content with a string literal and the calculation of page_content_len using sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char) - 1, which correctly yields the number of characters excluding the implicit terminating NUL (the literal initialization guarantees the NUL terminator). No pointer arithmetic or manual copying of the buffer is performed here; the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static is passed the buffer and its computed length matching the actual buffer size, so there is no apparent off\u2011by\u2011one or out\u2011of\u2011bounds access in this translation unit. The other calls (MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) are to external library functions and contain no direct use of <string.h> functions in this code fragment; any use of string.h inside those library implementations is outside the scope of this function and would need to be reviewed in that library code, not here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 21.17."
