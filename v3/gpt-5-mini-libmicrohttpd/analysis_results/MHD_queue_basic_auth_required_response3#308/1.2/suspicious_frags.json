  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The following constructs were inspected and determined not to be explicit extensions in this snippet:\n\n- No use of GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __asm__/asm, __builtin_... functions, or other compiler-specific keywords.\n- No use of MSVC-specific declspecs (e.g., __declspec) or other vendor-specific linkage keywords shown directly in this code.\n- Casting the result of malloc (char *)malloc(...) is standard C code (though sometimes discouraged stylistically), not a compiler extension.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES), macros (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_add_response_header, etc.), and the translation macro _() appear in the code, but their definitions are not present here. Their usage in this snippet is ordinary macro invocation; any compiler-specific extension would be visible only if those macros expand to extension constructs. The rule requires reporting explicit language extensions as used in the code, and none are present in this excerpt.\n\nIf you can provide the definitions of macros such as _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, or any other project header that might expand to compiler-specific constructs, I can re-check and flag any explicit compiler extensions that those expansions contain."
