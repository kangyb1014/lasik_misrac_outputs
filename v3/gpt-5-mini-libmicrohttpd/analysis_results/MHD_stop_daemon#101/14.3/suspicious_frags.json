  "explanation": "I reviewed all controlling constructs in the function (for, if, and preprocessor-selected code paths) looking for invariant controlling expressions as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. No suspicious invariant controlling expressions were found for these reasons:\n\n- for loops: there are two for loops: for (i = 0; i < daemon->worker_pool_size; ++i) (used twice). Their controlling expression depends on daemon->worker_pool_size, a runtime value, so it is not invariant.\n\n- if statements: all if/else controlling expressions depend on runtime values (daemon pointer, daemon->shutdown, daemon->master, daemon->was_quiesced, fd, daemon->worker_pool, various members such as itc, epoll_fd, etc.), not compile-time constants. Therefore none are invariant.\n\n- No while or do-while loops are present. The rule\u2019s permitted exceptions (infinite loops or a false do-while with integer constant expression) do not apply because those constructs are absent.\n\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) remove or include code at compile time, but they are not runtime controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3. The actual runtime controlling expressions inside the included code still depend on variables/fields and are not invariant.\n\n- Assertion macros (mhd_assert) are not loop/switch controlling expressions. They may be compiled out in production builds, but they do not introduce invariant loop controls in the shown code.\n\nGiven the above, there are no controlling expressions in this function that are constant/invariant and therefore no fragments requiring investigation for Rule 14.3."
