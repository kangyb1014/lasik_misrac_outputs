True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf the mhd_assert macro expands to a no-op in production builds (as many assert-like macros do), then the four (and conditional fifth) assertions are executed only to perform pure comparisons with no side effects. Removing those calls would not affect program behaviour, so they constitute dead code and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert is implemented to perform runtime actions\u2014logging, aborting, or other side effects\u2014then these statements are not dead and the rule would not be violated.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not deterministically correct because it depends entirely on how mhd_assert is defined in the project build.\n\n- If mhd_assert is defined as a true diagnostic/assertion (e.g. performs logging and/or aborts, or otherwise has observable side effects in production), then the calls are not dead \u2014 removing them would change program behaviour \u2014 so no Rule 2.2 violation.\n- If mhd_assert is defined to be a pure no-op that nevertheless still evaluates its condition expression (e.g. something that evaluates the expression but does not produce observable effects), then the comparisons (the argument expressions) would be executed but have no side effects; removing those calls would not change program behaviour (aside from possible timing), so that would satisfy the textual definition of dead code and could violate Rule 2.2. Note: MISRA explicitly points out that timing can be part of behaviour for embedded systems, so a change that only alters timing might still be considered a behaviour change in some contexts.\n- If mhd_assert is defined to completely compile away both the call and the evaluation of the condition (like assert(...) that becomes ((void)0) in a release build), then there is no executed code to consider and no dead code exists in the compiled project.\n\nConclusion: Agent A\u2019s report is only correct under a specific definition of mhd_assert (one that evaluates the condition but has no observable effects). Without knowing the actual macro definition/configuration used in the project, you cannot conclude there is a Rule 2.2 violation. Recommended action: verify the mhd_assert definition in the project and either ensure assertion macros have observable effects in production or exclude them from production builds in a way that does not leave executed, side\u2011effect\u2011free expressions (or otherwise remove them) to avoid potential dead code issues and timing ambiguities."
