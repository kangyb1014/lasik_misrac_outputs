It is executed but has no effect; removing it would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines like \u201c(void) con;\u201d are idiomatic no-op expressions used to document and suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not represent accidental, redundant algorithmic code that MISRA\u2019s dead\u2011code rule targets. MISRA C Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid executed code that is redundant in the sense of changing program runtime behaviour if removed; these cast-to-void statements have no runtime effect but are deliberate means to control diagnostics and document intent and are an accepted pattern. Removing them only affects compiler warnings, not program behaviour. Therefore flagging \u201c(void) con;\u201d as a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
