It is executed at runtime but has no side effects, and removing it would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) extra_in; (and the similar casts for other parameters) are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to silence compiler/analysis warnings. Although such an expression has no runtime side effects, MISRA\u2019s intent is to prohibit truly redundant executable code that can be removed without purpose; an explicit (void) parameter cast is a deliberate use (it documents intent and prevents unused-parameter diagnostics) and is an accepted, intended practice to satisfy interface requirements. Removing those lines may not change runtime behaviour but would change the program\u2019s static properties (warnings/compliance), so they are not considered the kind of \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
