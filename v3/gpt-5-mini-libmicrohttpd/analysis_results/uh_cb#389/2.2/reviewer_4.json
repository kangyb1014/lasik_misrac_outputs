  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The expression-statement \"(void) req_cls;\" is an executed no-op: it produces no side-effects and removing it would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour. Per the rule text (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), that meets the definition of dead code. (The common rationale for such casts \u2014 to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters \u2014 affects diagnostics only, not program behaviour, and so does not avoid the rule.)"
