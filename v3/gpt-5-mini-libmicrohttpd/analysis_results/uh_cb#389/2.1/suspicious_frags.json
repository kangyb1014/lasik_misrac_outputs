  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found. All calls that do not return (abort) occur only on error/conditional paths, so subsequent statements are reachable in the normal path. The early return is inside a conditional (sock_overflow) and does not make later code unreachable in the alternative path. There are no statements following an unconditional return, break, continue, goto, or other control-transfer that would make them unreachable in all execution paths. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in the provided function."
