  "explanation": "I selected the function parameter list and the explicit unused-parameter casts for cls, con and req_cls because these are non-const pointer parameters that are unused in the function body and therefore should be reviewed to see whether they could be declared to point to const-qualified types. I did not include extra_in/extra_in_size because extra_in is already declared as const char * (so it already satisfies Rule 8.13) and extra_in_size is a non-pointer. I did not include ws (struct WsData *ws) because that pointer is used to modify the allocated object (malloc/memset and member assignments), so it should not be const. I also did not flag uses of &MUTEX, CLIENT_SOCKS[], pthread_create/pthread_mutex_lock, or other non-pointer-signee expressions because those require mutable pointers by API contract or are not pointer-to-object declarations that can be const-qualified in this context."
