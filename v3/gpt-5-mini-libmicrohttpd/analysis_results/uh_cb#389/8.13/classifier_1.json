  "scenario": "The cast-to-void itself does not violate Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 would be violated if a pointer parameter that is not modified could and should be declared with a const-qualified pointee but is declared non-const. For example, if a function prototype used 'char *p' but only read from p, it should be 'const char *p' \u2014 leaving it as 'char *p' would violate the rule. In this code the parameter is an unused 'void *cls' (likely required by the library callback), so the '(void) cls;' suppression does not breach Rule 8.13."
