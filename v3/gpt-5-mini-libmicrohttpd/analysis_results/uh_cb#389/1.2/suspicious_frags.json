  "explanation": "I found no instances of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, labels-as-values (&&label), or __attribute__ usage.\n- There is no inline assembly (asm / __asm__), no use of compiler-specific keywords, and no use of vendor-specific pragmas or attributes.\n- The function declaration/definition and parameter list use standard C syntax; the use of an ampersand with a function name (&run_usock) is valid standard C (equivalent to run_usock) and is not a compiler extension.\n- Standard library and POSIX/pthread APIs (malloc, memset, pthread_create, pthread_detach, abort, free) are used; these are not compiler language extensions (they are external library / POSIX APIs).\n- Macros and typedefs shown (MHD_socket, MHD_YES/MHD_NO, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE) are not language extensions; their expansion could hide an extension, but the source text here contains no extension syntax.\n\nBecause none of the explicit extension syntaxes documented by common compilers appear in the source text, there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2. If you want, I can re-check when the full set of included headers or macro definitions is available (those could potentially expand to compiler-specific extensions)."
