  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function exhibit direct or indirect calls to file_reader. The function calls only standard I/O functions fseek, fread and ferror, and returns constants or cast results. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or calls to any user-defined functions that could resolve to file_reader. The cls parameter is cast to FILE * and used only as the first argument to standard library calls, so it cannot introduce recursion from within this snippet. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 based on the shown code."
