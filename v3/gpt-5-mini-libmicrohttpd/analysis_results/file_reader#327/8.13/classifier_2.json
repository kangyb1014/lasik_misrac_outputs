  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: in file_reader, 'buf' is used as an output buffer (written to by fread), so it must be a pointer to a modifiable char and char * is correct. A violation would occur if the function did not modify the pointed-to data but declared it as char * instead of const char * (i.e., a pointer to non-const where const could be used)."
