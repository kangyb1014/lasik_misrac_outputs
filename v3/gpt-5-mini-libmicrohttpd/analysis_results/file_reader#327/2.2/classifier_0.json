  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of file_reader:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nfile_reader (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *buf, size_t max)\n{\n  FILE *file = (FILE *) cls;\n  size_t bytes_read;\n\n  /* 'fseek' may not support files larger 2GiB, depending on platform.\n   * For production code, make sure that 'pos' has valid values, supported by\n   * 'fseek', or use 'fseeko' or similar function. */\n  if (0 != fseek (file, (long) pos, SEEK_SET))\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  bytes_read = fread (buf, 1, max, file);\n  if (0 == bytes_read)\n    return (0 != ferror (file)) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation found. Every statement in file_reader affects program behaviour: fseek controls file position and may return an error; fread reads data; the bytes_read==0 branch distinguishes end-of-stream from error via ferror; the final cast returns the number of bytes read. The local assignment FILE *file = (FILE *)cls is used by subsequent calls (removing it would require rewriting those calls) and is not 'dead' in the MISRA sense. There is no executed operation that can be removed without changing behaviour."
