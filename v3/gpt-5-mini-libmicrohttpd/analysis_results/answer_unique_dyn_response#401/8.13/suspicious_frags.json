  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they do not present an apparent violation of \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\":\n- The parameters declared const (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) already use const qualification and therefore do not need further investigation for this rule.\n- The (void) casts for unused parameters only suppress unused warnings and do not change pointer qualification.\n- The strcmp usage reads via const char *method (already const-qualified) and does not modify pointed data.\n- Local variables 'r' and 'ret' and the static int marker declaration are not pointer types that should be const-qualified under this rule.\n- The call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static passing body_dyn without a cast is not obviously removing constness in this code snippet.\nThe selected fragments are those that explicitly involve non-const pointer parameters/assignments or casts that remove const qualification and therefore merit investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
