  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statements ((void) url; (void) version; etc.) are plain no-op expressions used to suppress \"unused parameter\" warnings and to document that those parameters are intentionally unused. Although removing them would not change the program's observable run-time behaviour, they are an accepted, intentional idiom for handling unused parameters and are not the sort of unintended, removable code that MISRA's Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. Therefore Agent A's assertion that those lines constitute a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct. (If a project applies a stricter interpretation, these statements could be justified in a compliance report; they are not unreachably dead code in the usual MISRA sense.)"
