  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) upload_data; and (void) upload_data_size; statements are the common, deliberate technique to mark function parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. They are a source-level annotation indicating intended use \u2014 they prevent \u201cunused parameter\u201d diagnostics \u2014 and are not considered harmful dead code in the sense intended by MISRA. In practice these statements typically generate no observable runtime effect (and often no object code), but their presence conveys programmer intent and affects tool diagnostics; MISRA guidance accepts explicit casts-to-void as the appropriate way to indicate unused parameters. Therefore this code does not constitute a violation of Rule 2.2 as claimed by agent A."
