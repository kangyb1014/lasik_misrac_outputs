  "explanation": "The rule concerns modification of the function parameter pointer itself (here: parameter 'connection'), not modification of the object it points to. I inspected the function for any assignments or operations that change the parameter pointer or reassign an alias to a different address. Findings:\n\n- The only use of the parameter is to create a const pointer alias: \"struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;\". The alias is a const pointer (pointer itself is const), so this does not modify the parameter and prevents later reassignment of the alias.\n- A second alias is created: \"struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;\". This is also a const pointer and there is no reassignment to it or to the original parameter.\n- All subsequent writes are to members of the object pointed to by the parameter (e.g., c->keepalive, c->rp.props.*). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is explicitly permitted by the rule.\n- There are no occurrences of pointer arithmetic, reassignments to connection/c, or passing the address of the parameter for modification.\n\nBecause there are no statements that modify the pointer parameter itself, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
