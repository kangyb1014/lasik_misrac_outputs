In this function 'r' is only used for reading its fields (e.g. r->total_size, r->flags_auto, r->flags, r->upgrade_handler), so it could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Response *const r').

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. In this function the local alias r is declared as 'struct MHD_Response *const r' (the pointer is const but the pointed-to type is not). All uses of r in the function are reads (r->total_size, r->flags_auto, r->flags, r->upgrade_handler, and the NULL check). There are no writes through r, so the pointed-to type can and should be const-qualified to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A suitable fix is to declare r as 'const struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;'. Assigning a non-const pointer to a pointer-to-const is allowed, and this change does not affect other modifications made to c or c->rp.props in the function (those are separate objects). Therefore agent A's report is correct."
