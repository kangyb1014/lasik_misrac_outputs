If the member username.value.str is declared as a pointer to non-const (e.g. char *str), then the pointer points to a non-const-qualified target while only being used for read-only purposes. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const char *str) whenever possible. Therefore this use constitutes a violation: the member should be changed to point to a const-qualified type.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns the declaration of pointer types (they should point to const-qualified types when that is appropriate), not every read-only use of a pointer. In the snippet the function receives a pointer to a const struct (const struct MHD_RqDAuth *params) and only inspects params->username.value.str by comparing it to NULL. That use alone does not prove a violation of 8.13: the rule would be violated (if at all) at the place where username.value.str is declared (e.g. as char *str) if that pointer could and should be const-qualified. From this function alone you cannot determine whether the member's type could safely be changed to const (it may be modified elsewhere), so the report is not justified based on the shown code."
