  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function body contains only conditional checks, member accesses, constant/enum values, and return statements \u2014 there are no function calls (direct) and no expressions that could perform indirect calls (no function pointer dereferences, no invocation-like macro usage, and no calls to other functions). The _MHD_static_inline token is a storage-class/inline specifier macro and does not imply a call. Constants such as MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN and enum selectors are not function calls. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calls to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
