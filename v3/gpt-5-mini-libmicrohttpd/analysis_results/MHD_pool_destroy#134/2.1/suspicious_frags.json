  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function are either runtime-conditional or resolved at compile time and therefore are not necessarily unreachable in a given translation unit: the initial NULL check and early return are intentional control flow; the mhd_assert calls and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY call are normal runtime/debug operations; the if/else on pool->is_mmap makes the memory-release calls conditional at runtime; the platform-specific munmap(...) and VirtualFree(...) calls are selected by the preprocessor and will be present only in the appropriate builds, so they are reachable in those builds. Because the preprocessor eliminates the other platform branches, those platform-specific fragments are not statically unreachable in the resulting translation unit. Therefore they do not require further investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1."
