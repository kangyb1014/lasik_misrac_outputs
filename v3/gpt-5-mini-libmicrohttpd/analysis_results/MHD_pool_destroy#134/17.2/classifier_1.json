  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code: calling the standard library free(pool) does not call MHD_pool_destroy directly or indirectly. A violation would only occur in a pathological environment where free is replaced by a custom allocator that, during its cleanup, invokes MHD_pool_destroy (e.g. free -> custom cleanup -> MHD_pool_destroy), which would create indirect recursion."
