  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_destroy:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_pool_destroy (struct MemoryPool *pool)\n{\n  if (NULL == pool)\n    return;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory, pool->size);\n  if (! pool->is_mmap)\n    free (pool->memory);\n  else\n#if defined(MAP_ANONYMOUS) && ! defined(_WIN32)\n    munmap (pool->memory,\n            pool->size);\n#elif defined(_WIN32)\n    VirtualFree (pool->memory,\n                 0,\n                 MEM_RELEASE);\n#else\n    abort ();\n#endif\n  free (pool);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation is evident. The statement is an assertion that checks a runtime invariant and can affect program behaviour (e.g. abort) if it fails, so its removal could change behaviour. It would only violate Rule 2.2 in a specific case: if mhd_assert expands to code that is executed in the shipped build, ROUND_TO_ALIGN has no side\u2011effects, and the invariant is provably always true (so the check is executed but redundant) \u2014 then that executed, redundant check would be dead code. If mhd_assert is compiled out (no-op) the check is not executed and therefore is not \"dead code\" under MISRA Note 2."
