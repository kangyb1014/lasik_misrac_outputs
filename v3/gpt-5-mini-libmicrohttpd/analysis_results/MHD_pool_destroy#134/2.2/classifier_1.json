Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_destroy:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_pool_destroy (struct MemoryPool *pool)\n{\n  if (NULL == pool)\n    return;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory, pool->size);\n  if (! pool->is_mmap)\n    free (pool->memory);\n  else\n#if defined(MAP_ANONYMOUS) && ! defined(_WIN32)\n    munmap (pool->memory,\n            pool->size);\n#elif defined(_WIN32)\n    VirtualFree (pool->memory,\n                 0,\n                 MEM_RELEASE);\n#else\n    abort ();\n#endif\n  free (pool);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory, pool->size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "This cannot be determined from the fragment alone. If _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY expands to a no-op in all builds (for example: #define _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(p,s) ((void)0)), then the call is dead code: it is executed (or present) but its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 violating Rule 2.2. Conversely, if _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY performs runtime actions (e.g. unpoisoning for sanitizers, calls to tooling APIs), then its removal would affect behaviour and it is not dead code."
