  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2 because they perform required control-flow or resource-management actions that clearly affect program behaviour: the initial NULL check and early return prevent invalid dereference; the final free(pool) releases the MemoryPool structure; the platform-specific unmap/free calls (selected at compile time by the preprocessor) are necessary to release the allocated backing storage on their respective platforms. Also, preprocessor conditionals mean only the applicable platform branch is present in a given build, so inactive branches are not part of the compiled code. These operations are not removable without changing runtime behaviour, therefore they are not candidates for dead code investigation."
