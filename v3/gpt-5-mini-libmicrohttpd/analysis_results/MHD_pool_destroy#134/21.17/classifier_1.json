  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code fragment does not directly call any <string.h> function. The macro/function _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is not one of the standard string.h routines listed in MISRA Rule 21.17. In addition, it is called with pool->memory and pool->size, and preceding assertions indicate the pool memory and size are consistent with the allocation, so there is no indication of an access beyond the bounds. (If _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY were implemented using a string.h function like memset/memcpy, it would still be safe here provided it uses the pointer and size that match the allocated region; only an implementation that used a larger size or an invalid pointer would violate the rule.)"
