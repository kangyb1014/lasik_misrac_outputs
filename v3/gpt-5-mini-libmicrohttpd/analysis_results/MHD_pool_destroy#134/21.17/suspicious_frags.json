  "explanation": "There are no explicit calls to any functions from <string.h> in this function. Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the standard string handling functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, strlen, etc.) that can access beyond object bounds. The fragments selected above are all places that operate on raw memory pointers and sizes (or assert invariants about those sizes) and therefore deserve investigation to ensure that any underlying/macros/implementations they invoke do not call string.h routines or otherwise cause out-of-bounds accesses. Other parts of the function (the NULL check and early return; the compile-time branching and abort(); the control flow and syntactic boilerplate) do not call or pass pointer/size pairs to string handling functions and thus do not need to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
