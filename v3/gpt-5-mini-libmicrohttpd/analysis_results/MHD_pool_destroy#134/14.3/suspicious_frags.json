  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is statically invariant. Reasons: \n- if (NULL == pool) depends on the function parameter and is not constant.\n- The mhd_assert(...) invocations are macro calls whose operands reference pool fields; those expressions are not constant. Even if the macro expands to an if, the asserted expressions depend on run-time values (pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size) and are therefore not invariant.\n- if (! pool->is_mmap) depends on a run-time structure member and is not invariant.\n- The platform selection is done with preprocessor conditionals (#if / #elif / #else). Preprocessor directives are resolved at translation phase and are not C-language controlling expressions subject to MISRA Rule 14.3; after preprocessing the remaining C controlling expressions are not constant. For example, in some build configurations the code may compile to else abort(); that else is still controlled by the runtime is_mmap test, not an invariant controlling expression in the source C code.\n- There are no for/while/do-while loops with constant controlling expressions (no infinite-loop pattern or do-while(false) constant), so the listed exceptions do not need to be applied.\nGiven the above, there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
