  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Passing pool->memory to VirtualFree is appropriate: the memory is being released and the Windows API expects a non-const void* (LPVOID). Making the pointer const would be inappropriate here (and would require a cast to call VirtualFree). If pool->memory were declared as const void* and an explicit cast to void* were used to call VirtualFree, that would indicate a const-qualification issue (and violate the intent of 8.13), but the shown fragment itself does not violate Rule 8.13."
