  "scenario": "No violation: pool->memory is a mutable buffer being unpoisoned and then freed, so passing a non\u2011const pointer to _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is appropriate. Rule 8.13 requires pointers be const\u2011qualified when they point to data that will not be modified; in this destroy path the memory is mutable (and likely subject to operations that require a non\u2011const pointer), so there is no breach. (If, instead, pool->memory were never modified anywhere and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY only inspected it, then declaring the pointer or the function parameter as pointing to a const-qualified type would be required \u2014 that would be a violation in the current code.)"
