  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning by code fragment:\n- Function parameter is \"struct MemoryPool *pool\". There is no assignment to the parameter variable pool (no statements like \"pool = ...\"), so the pointer itself is not modified.\n- The NULL check and return (if (NULL == pool) return;) only read the parameter, not modify it.\n- The mhd_assert calls only inspect members of *pool (pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size) \u2014 accessing or modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule; the prohibition is only on modifying the pointer parameter itself.\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pool->memory, pool->size) and the subsequent free/munmap/VirtualFree calls operate on objects referenced by members of *pool (pool->memory, pool->size). Modifying or deallocating the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule; it does not change the pointer variable pool.\n- The final free(pool) deallocates the object pointed to by the parameter, which is an allowed modification of the object referred to; it does not assign to or otherwise change the pointer variable pool.\n- No macros or conditional branches reassign the pool parameter or perform any operation that changes its value.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or require investigation for Rule 17.8."
