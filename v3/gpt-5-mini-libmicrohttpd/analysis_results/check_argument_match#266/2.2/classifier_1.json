  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_argument_match:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncheck_argument_match (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                      char *args)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  struct test_header_param param;\n\n  param.connection = connection;\n  param.num_headers = 0;\n  ret = MHD_parse_arguments_ (connection,\n                              MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND,\n                              args,\n                              &test_header,\n                              &param);\n  if (MHD_NO == ret)\n  {\n    return false;\n  }\n  /* also check that the number of headers matches */\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != pos->kind)\n      continue;\n    param.num_headers--;\n  }\n  if (0 != param.num_headers)\n  {\n    /* argument count mismatch */\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nret = MHD_parse_arguments_ (connection,\n                              MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND,\n                              args,\n                              &test_header,\n                              &param);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to MHD_parse_arguments_ is used: its return value (ret) is checked and it populates/initializes param (param.num_headers) which is later inspected and adjusted. Removing this call would change program behaviour (return path and header count check), so the operation is not dead code."
