  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_argument_match:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncheck_argument_match (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                      char *args)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  struct test_header_param param;\n\n  param.connection = connection;\n  param.num_headers = 0;\n  ret = MHD_parse_arguments_ (connection,\n                              MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND,\n                              args,\n                              &test_header,\n                              &param);\n  if (MHD_NO == ret)\n  {\n    return false;\n  }\n  /* also check that the number of headers matches */\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != pos->kind)\n      continue;\n    param.num_headers--;\n  }\n  if (0 != param.num_headers)\n  {\n    /* argument count mismatch */\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != pos->kind)\n      continue;\n    param.num_headers--;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. First clause initializes the single loop counter (pos = connection->rq.headers_received). Second clause is a pure test using only the loop counter (NULL != pos) with no side effects. Third clause updates only the loop counter (pos = pos->next) and does not use any object that is modified in the loop body (the body modifies param.num_headers, not pos or pos->next). The loop counter (pos) is not modified inside the loop body. Therefore the for loop is well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
