  "explanation": "I found no use of the standard library function memcmp (or any direct byte-wise comparison) in this code fragment. The function only calls MHD_parse_arguments_, compares enum/return values (MHD_NO == ret, MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != pos->kind), decrements/compares an integer counter (param.num_headers), and returns boolean results. There are no string comparisons performed here (args is passed through to MHD_parse_arguments_ but not compared in this code). Therefore there are no places in this fragment that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: any use of memcmp inside called functions (e.g. MHD_parse_arguments_) is outside the scope of this fragment and would need to be inspected in their implementations if required."
