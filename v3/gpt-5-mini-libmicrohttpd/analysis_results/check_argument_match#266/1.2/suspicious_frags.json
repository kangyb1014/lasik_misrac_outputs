  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, or double-underscore reserved identifiers.\n- There are no statement-expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions (GCC extension) present.\n- There are no compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or keywords (for example, __inline or __forceinline) used.\n- The use of bool/true/false and enum/struct/static/for/return/NULL are standard C language features (C99/C11) and not compiler extensions; if bool is provided via stdbool.h or a project typedef, that is standard practice rather than a compiler extension.\n- Identifier names like MHD_parse_arguments_ and MHD_* are library identifiers, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this code. If the target compiler documentation explicitly lists any of these identifiers or constructs as an extension in your build environment, please provide that compiler documentation or indicate the specific extension so it can be re-evaluated."
