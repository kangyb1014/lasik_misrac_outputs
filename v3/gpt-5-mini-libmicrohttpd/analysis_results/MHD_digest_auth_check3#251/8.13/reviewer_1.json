True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nMHD_digest_auth_check3 takes a connection pointer but does not modify it and simply forwards it to digest_auth_check_all. If digest_auth_check_all treats the connection as input-only (does not modify it), then the parameter should be declared const (i.e. const struct MHD_Connection *connection). Because the declaration uses struct MHD_Connection *connection without const even though it appears to be used read-only, this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If digest_auth_check_all or other callees actually need to modify the connection, then the non-const declaration would be justified and there would be no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not deterministically correct based on the snippet alone. Rule 8.13 says pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, but whether the parameter here 'should' be const depends on the rest of the program: specifically the declaration/usage of digest_auth_check_all and whether any code (in that function or elsewhere) modifies the connection. In the shown function MHD_digest_auth_check3 the connection is only forwarded to digest_auth_check_all, so you cannot conclude a violation without checking that callee and the full call chain treat the connection as read-only. If digest_auth_check_all (or other callees) requires a non-const pointer or modifies the connection, the non-const parameter is justified and there is no violation. If the entire call chain is read-only, then the API could/should be changed to use const, but that cannot be inferred from this fragment alone. Therefore agent A\u2019s report is not decisively correct."
