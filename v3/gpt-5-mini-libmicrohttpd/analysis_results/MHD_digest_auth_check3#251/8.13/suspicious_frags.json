  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the fragment are already const-qualified (realm, username, password are declared as const char *), so they comply with Rule 8.13. The NULL literal passed as an argument is not itself a pointer declaration that needs const qualification. mhd_assert is only checking password for NULL and does not indicate a missing const qualification. All non-pointer parameters (nonce_timeout, max_nc, enums) and the return type are value types or enums and thus not subject to this rule. Therefore only the non-const connection pointer and its use in the call need investigation."
