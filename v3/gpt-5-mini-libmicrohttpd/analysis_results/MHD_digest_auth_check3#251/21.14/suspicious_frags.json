  "explanation": "No direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp appears in this snippet. The only potential point where null-terminated strings (realm, username, password) are forwarded to code that might perform comparisons is the call to digest_auth_check_all (listed above) \u2014 that call is therefore included for further inspection. Other parts of this snippet do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 because:\n- The function signature and parameter declarations only declare pointers/values; they do not perform comparisons.\n- The mhd_assert (NULL != password); line is an assertion, not a string comparison or memcmp use.\n- There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or similar string-comparison functions in this fragment.\nTherefore, aside from the call to digest_auth_check_all (which should be inspected in its implementation), there are no other code fragments in this snippet that could violate Rule 21.14."
