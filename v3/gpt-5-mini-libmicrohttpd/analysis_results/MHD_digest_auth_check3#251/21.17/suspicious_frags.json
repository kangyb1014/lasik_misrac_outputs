  "explanation": "No direct use of any <string.h> functions appears in this function body. The only locations that could result in out-of-bounds accesses from string handling are: the assertion that password is non-NULL (to ensure it is at least a valid pointer) and the call to digest_auth_check_all, which receives the string pointers and may perform string.h operations internally. Those two fragments are therefore flagged for investigation. Other parts of the fragment (function signature, parameter declarations, braces, and return type) contain no string manipulation and do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 based on the provided code."
