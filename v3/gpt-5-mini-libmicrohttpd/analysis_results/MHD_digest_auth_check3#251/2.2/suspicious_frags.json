The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have included the function body and the two executed statements inside it as the fragments to investigate. No other parts of the provided code contain executed operations that could be removed without affecting behaviour: the parameter list and types are declarations only (not executed statements), there are no local variable assignments or initializations besides those listed, and there is no unreachable code in the snippet. Therefore only the listed fragments need investigation for potential dead-code concerns."
