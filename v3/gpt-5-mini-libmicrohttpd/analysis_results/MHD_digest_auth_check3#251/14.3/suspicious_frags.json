  "explanation": "No other controlling statements (if, switch, for, while, do-while) appear in this function body, so there are no other controlling expressions in this snippet to inspect for Rule 14.3. The single assertion line is reported because mhd_assert is a macro that may expand to a controlling construct (for example an if or similar); that expansion should be inspected to ensure the controlling expression is not invariant. The call to digest_auth_check_all and the return statement contain no controlling expressions in this function and any control expressions inside the called function are outside the provided snippet and therefore not part of this review."
