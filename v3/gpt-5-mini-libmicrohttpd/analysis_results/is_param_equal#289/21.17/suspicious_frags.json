  "explanation": "The two listed fragments directly invoke string-handling functionality (one via an external helper and one via memcmp) and must be examined to ensure the size arguments and pointer targets cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses. Other parts of the function do not need separate investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the function signature, enclosing braces, and the control-flow test (if (param->quoted)) do not themselves call <string.h> functions or perform buffer accesses. The mhd_assert lines merely state expected preconditions (they do not invoke string.h functions); any reliance on those assertions for safety should be evaluated in the context of the two suspicious fragments already listed rather than as independent string.h usages."
