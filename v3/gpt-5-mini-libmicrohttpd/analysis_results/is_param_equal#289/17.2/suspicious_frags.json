  "explanation": "There is no direct call to is_param_equal in this function, so no obvious direct recursion. Recursion (indirect) could only occur if one of the called functions or macros calls back into is_param_equal. I have therefore listed every function/macro call site present in this function so they can be inspected for potential indirect calls: the two mhd_assert invocations, the call to MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n, and the memcmp usage. All other fragments in the function (parameter declarations, member accesses, the conditional check on param->quoted, length comparisons, and the return/boolean logic) do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
