  "explanation": "No code fragments in this function are statically unreachable. Reasoning:\n- There is no code after an unconditional return inside the same block; the two return statements are in alternate control paths (the if (param->quoted) branch and the fall-through branch) and both are reachable depending on the runtime value of param->quoted.\n- There are no unconditional jumps, infinite loops, or labels/gotos that would render following code unreachable.\n- The assertions (mhd_assert) are runtime checks; while they may abort execution when triggered, that is a runtime behavior and does not create statically unreachable code in the source. Their presence does not make any subsequent source lines impossible to reach in general.\n- No preprocessor conditionals or compiler-specific attributes in the shown fragment remove or disable code paths at compile time.\n- All function calls and expressions (MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n, memcmp) are invoked on reachable control-flow paths.\nTherefore, this function does not contain code that appears unreachable under normal static analysis for MISRA C Rule 2.1."
