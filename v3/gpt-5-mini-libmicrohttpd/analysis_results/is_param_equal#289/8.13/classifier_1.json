  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not violate Rule 8.13. memcmp has signature int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n) so passing str (const char *const) and param->value.str is type-compatible. Rule 8.13 concerns declarations: if the struct member value.str were declared as non-const (e.g. char *value.str) while it actually points to immutable data, that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const char *value.str. However, from this single call expression there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 violation."
