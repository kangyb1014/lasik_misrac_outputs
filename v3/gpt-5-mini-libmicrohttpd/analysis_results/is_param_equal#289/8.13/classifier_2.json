  "scenario": "The expression param->value.str refers to a pointer-to-mutable-char. Although param is a pointer to a const struct, that yields a char * const lvalue (top-level const on the pointer), not a pointer to const data. If the string is only read (as here), MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires the pointer to point to a const-qualified type (i.e. const char *). In other words, if struct MHD_RqDAuthParam::value.str is declared as char * (or ends up as char * via the member type), this use violates Rule 8.13; the member should be declared as const char * (or equivalent) so the pointer points to const-qualified data."
