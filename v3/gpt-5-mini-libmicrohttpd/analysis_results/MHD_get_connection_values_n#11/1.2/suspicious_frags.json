  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the shown code: there are no uses of __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, computed gotos (&&label), __extension__ or other known compiler-specific keywords/constructs. All constructs used (standard enum, pointers, struct member access, function pointer call, macros, comparisons) are valid standard C.\n\nOne potential area to check (not reported as a confirmed extension) is the macro _MHD_EXTERN at the function start \u2014 macros can expand to compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__((...))). Because the expansion is not shown here, it is not possible to assert that an extension is used. Reviewers should inspect the definition of _MHD_EXTERN to ensure it does not expand to a compiler-specific extension. Apart from that, no other fragments warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
