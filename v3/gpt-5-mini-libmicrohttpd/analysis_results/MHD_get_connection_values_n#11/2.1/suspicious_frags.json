  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Control-flow paths are all potentially reachable: the early return on NULL connection is conditional and only prevents execution when connection is NULL; the two alternative for-loops are selected by the runtime value of iterator (either NULL or non-NULL) so both branches can be reached in different runs; each for-loop iterates over connection->rq.headers_received which may be NULL (resulting in zero iterations) but that does not make the loop body unreachable in general. The conditional inside the loops (if (0 != (kind & pos->kind))) can be either true or false depending on data, and the inner return when iterator returns MHD_NO is reachable when that callback yields that value. There are no gotos, unreachable labels, constant-false conditions, or code after unconditional returns in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
