The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have flagged the function and its key return/conditional fragments because they are the places most likely to hide dead code or be removed without changing program behaviour (static function possibly unused; repeated/odd return expressions). Other code fragments in this snippet were not flagged for investigation because:\n- The comparison against MHD_NO (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported(...)) is a runtime capability check and represents control logic that can legitimately alter behaviour; it is not intrinsically dead.\n- The fprintf call (error message) has an observable side effect (output to stderr) and so is not dead code; it must be preserved if reachable.\n- The conditional structure (if/else flow) and braces are normal control constructs; there is no unreachable statement following a return within the same block other than the intended returns already flagged.\n- There are no initializations here that could be mistaken for dead assignments.\nIf further context (e.g. whether this static function is ever called, or whether MHD_is_feature_supported can be constant for the build) is provided, it will help determine whether the flagged fragments are actual instances of Rule 2.2 violations."
