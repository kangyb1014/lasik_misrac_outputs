  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls MHD_is_feature_supported and fprintf, not check_param__poll itself. There is no direct self-call. There is also no evidence of indirect recursion (i.e. MHD_is_feature_supported or fprintf calling back into check_param__poll). Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated."
