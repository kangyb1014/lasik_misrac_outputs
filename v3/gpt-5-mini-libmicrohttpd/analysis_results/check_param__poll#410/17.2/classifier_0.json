  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment calls fprintf(stderr, ...) from within check_param__poll. fprintf is a standard library I/O function and does not call check_param__poll, so there is no direct or indirect recursive call present in the shown code. Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated."
