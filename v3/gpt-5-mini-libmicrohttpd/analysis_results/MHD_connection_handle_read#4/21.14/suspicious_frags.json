  "explanation": "I inspected the entire body of MHD_connection_handle_read provided. There are no calls to memcmp, no uses of memcmp-like macros, and no direct comparisons of null-terminated strings using memory-compare operations in this fragment. The only string-related usages are logging calls (e.g. str_conn_error_, MHD_state_to_string) passed to logging functions, not compared via memcmp. Buffer handling in this function uses read_buffer offsets and sizes and does not compare buffer contents. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: functions or macros called from here\u2014such as MHD_state_to_string, str_conn_error_, or CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR\u2014are outside this fragment; if they contain memcmp string comparisons, they would need separate review, but they are not present in the supplied code.)"
