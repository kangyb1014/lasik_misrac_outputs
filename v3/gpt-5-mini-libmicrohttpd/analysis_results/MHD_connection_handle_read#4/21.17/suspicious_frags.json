  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were reviewed and do not directly perform pointer arithmetic or pass buffer pointers and lengths in a way that can cause accesses beyond object bounds via standard <string.h> functions. Specifically:\n- Logging and diagnostic calls (e.g., MHD_DLOG, str_conn_error_) do not pass caller-controlled buffer pointers/lengths into string.h functions in this fragment and are limited to formatting/logging usage.\n- TLS handshake branch and state-switch logic only manage control flow and do not perform raw buffer reads/writes or call string handling functions with buffer pointers/lengths.\n- The &dummy recv used for socket-error detection uses a local object with sizeof(dummy) and is safe with respect to bounds.\n- Assertions and early returns prevent obvious null-pointer or zero-space conditions but the exact boundary checks are the concern and are covered by the reported fragments.\n\nThe reported fragments include every place in this function where a buffer pointer and a computed length are combined (indexing into read_buffer and passing read_buffer_size - read_buffer_offset to recv_cls), where the read_buffer_offset is incremented by bytes_read, and where the code later reallocates/shrinks the buffer using read_buffer_offset as a new size. These are the code locations that require investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses (e.g., offset > size underflowing the subtraction, bytes_read exceeding remaining space, or inconsistent reallocation sizes). No other code parts in this function directly present such risks."
