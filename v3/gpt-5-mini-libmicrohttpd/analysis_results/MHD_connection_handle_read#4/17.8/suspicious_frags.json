  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that reassign or modify the function parameters themselves. Specifically:\n- The parameter 'connection' (a pointer) is never assigned to (no statements like 'connection = ...'). All assignments use members of the object it points to (e.g., 'connection->read_buffer = ...' or 'connection->read_buffer_offset += ...'), which is permitted by the rule.\n- The parameter 'socket_error' (a scalar) is only read in conditional expressions and is never assigned to or modified.\n- Calls that pass 'connection' (e.g., 'connection->recv_cls(connection, ...)') pass the pointer to other functions; that does not itself modify the parameter variable in this function. If further investigation is needed, reviewers should inspect the called functions for any attempt to modify the caller's parameter variable (which would require passing a pointer-to-pointer and is not present here).\nGiven the code, there are no direct violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
