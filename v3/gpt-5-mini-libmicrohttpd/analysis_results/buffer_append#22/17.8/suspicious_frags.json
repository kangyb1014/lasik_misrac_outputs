  "explanation": "No function parameter variable itself is assigned to anywhere in the function. The only mutations are to objects addressed by pointer parameters and to memory pointed to by pointer parameters: 1) '*ppos += append_size;' modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter 'ppos' \u2014 this is allowed by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). 2) 'memcpy(buf + *ppos, append, append_size);' writes into the buffer object pointed to by 'buf' \u2014 again allowed. The other parameters ('buf_size', 'append', 'append_size') are only read, not assigned. There are no statements that reassign the pointer parameters themselves (e.g. 'buf = ...' or 'ppos = ...'), nor are non-pointer parameters modified. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing requiring further investigation under that rule."
