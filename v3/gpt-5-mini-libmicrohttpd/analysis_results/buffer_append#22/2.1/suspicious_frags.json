  "explanation": "The rest of the source contains only the function signature, parameter declarations, braces and a comment; these do not introduce conditional control flow, labels, gotos, switch/case branches or other constructs that could themselves be unreachable. All statements that could affect reachability (the assertion, the buffer-size check with its immediate return, the buffer write, the position update, and the final return) are included above and should be examined. No other code fragments in the function can produce unreachable code, so they need not be investigated."
