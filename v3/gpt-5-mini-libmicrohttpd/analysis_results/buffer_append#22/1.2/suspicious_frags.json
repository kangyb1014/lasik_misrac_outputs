  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: static storage class, the bool and size_t types (standard C types), standard library function memcpy, pointer arithmetic, and a macro call mhd_assert (a project macro, not a compiler language extension). There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, inline assembler, statement expressions ({ ... ; }), typeof, nested functions, or platform pragmas. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
