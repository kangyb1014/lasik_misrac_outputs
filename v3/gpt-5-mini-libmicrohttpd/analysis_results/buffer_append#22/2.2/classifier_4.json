  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of buffer_append:\n```c\nstatic bool\nbuffer_append (char *buf,\n               size_t *ppos,\n               size_t buf_size,\n               const char *append,\n               size_t append_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != buf); /* Mute static analyzer */\n  if (buf_size < *ppos + append_size)\n    return false;\n  memcpy (buf + *ppos, append, append_size);\n  *ppos += append_size;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic bool\nbuffer_append (char *buf,\n               size_t *ppos,\n               size_t buf_size,\n               const char *append,\n               size_t append_size)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No evidence in the provided fragment that dead code exists. The function header itself does not violate Rule 2.2. A violation would occur if this static function is never referenced anywhere in the translation unit (i.e. an unused static function \u2014 dead code). To confirm: check for calls to buffer_append across the translation unit or enable compiler warnings such as -Wunused-function; if there are none, the static definition would be dead code and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
