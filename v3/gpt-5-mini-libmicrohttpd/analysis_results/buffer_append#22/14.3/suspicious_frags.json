  "explanation": "Only the if statement contains a controlling expression in this function and should be investigated for Rule 14.3. The other lines are not controlling statements (the mhd_assert is a macro invocation, memcpy and returns are not control-flow conditions), so they are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in this fragment, and no obvious compile-time constant expressions used as controlling expressions; the if condition depends on function parameters and therefore is not an invariant constant expression by itself. Thus no other fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
