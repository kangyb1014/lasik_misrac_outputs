  "explanation": "I found no uses of the standard library function memcmp nor any code that performs a memory comparison of null-terminated strings. The only string-related operations are:\n- The PACKAGE_VERSION branch returns PACKAGE_VERSION (a macro/string literal) \u2014 no memcmp involved.\n- The static buffer initialization: static char ver[12] = \"\\0...\" \u2014 this only sets bytes to NUL.\n- The test if (0 == ver[0]) \u2014 a single-byte equality test against NUL, not a multi-byte memory comparison.\n- The call to MHD_snprintf_ to format into ver and the subsequent integer checks on res \u2014 these are formatting/length checks, not calls to memcmp.\n- Returning string literals (\"0.0.0\") or the ver buffer \u2014 returning pointers is not a memcmp usage.\n\nBecause Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and there are no memcmp calls or equivalent multi-byte memory comparisons of C strings in this function, there are no fragments that need investigation for this rule."
