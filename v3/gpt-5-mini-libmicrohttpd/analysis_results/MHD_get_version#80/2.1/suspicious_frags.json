  "explanation": "The primary potential for unreachable code here comes from the conditional compilation using PACKAGE_VERSION: the #ifdef branch (return PACKAGE_VERSION;) and the #else branch (the static ver buffer and associated logic) are mutually exclusive at compile time, so each branch can be unreachable depending on build configuration and thus both should be reviewed. The rest of the function contains control flow that is potentially executed at runtime (the initialization of ver, the if (0 == ver[0]) check which is true on first call, the call to MHD_snprintf_, and the subsequent return ver;) \u2014 these are reachable in at least one compilation/configuration and at runtime, so they do not by themselves indicate unreachable code that would violate MISRA Rule 2.1. There are no other unconditional statements after returns in a single compiled branch (no code following an unconditional return within the same compilation unit), and the nested return \"0.0.0\" is conditional and therefore not inherently unreachable. Consequently, only the conditional compilation branches and the explicitly conditional return were flagged for investigation."
