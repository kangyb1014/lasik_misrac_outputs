  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_version:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_version (void)\n{\n#ifdef PACKAGE_VERSION\n  return PACKAGE_VERSION;\n#else  /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n  static char ver[12] = \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\";\n  if (0 == ver[0])\n  {\n    int res = MHD_snprintf_ (ver,\n                             sizeof(ver),\n                             \"%x.%x.%x\",\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 24) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 16) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 8) & 0xFF));\n    if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res))\n      return \"0.0.0\"; /* Can't return real version */\n  }\n  return ver;\n#endif /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn ver;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "In the #else branch when PACKAGE_VERSION is not defined, the function returns the static buffer ver after it has been (possibly) initialized by MHD_snprintf_. The statement return ver; is executed at runtime (except when the earlier error path returns \"0.0.0\") and removal would change the function's behaviour (callers would no longer receive the formatted version string). Therefore this return is not dead code."
