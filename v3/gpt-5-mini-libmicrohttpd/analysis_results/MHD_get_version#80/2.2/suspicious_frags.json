  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were not marked for investigation because they are either necessary for correct operation or are not candidates for dead-code per MISRA guidance. In particular: the format string \"%x.%x.%x\" and the bit-shift expressions are needed to produce the version text; the casts to uint32_t and int are present to ensure well-defined integer widths and proper variadic promotion for the printf-like call; the final return (when not flagged) is required to return the computed buffer. Preprocessor conditional structure (#ifdef / #else / #endif) is expected here to select one of two implementations at compile time; unreachable code eliminated by the preprocessor is not \"dead code\" in the MISRA sense (note 2). Comments and the function signature are non-executable and thus not candidates for dead code. Other simple syntactic elements (braces, sizeof usage) are standard control/size operations and do not themselves indicate executed-but-removable operations."
