  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Potential candidates and reasons they do not require investigation:\n\n- if (0 == ver[0]) \u2014 although ver is statically initialized to zeros, ver[0] is modified by the snprintf call on first entry, so the controlling expression is not invariant across function invocations.\n\n- if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res)) \u2014 sizeof(ver) is a compile-time constant, but the expression depends on the runtime value res; the overall expression is therefore not invariant.\n\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef PACKAGE_VERSION / #else) are not runtime controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3.\n\n- There are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions; the do-while exception is not applicable.\n\nTherefore no code fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and no fragments need further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
