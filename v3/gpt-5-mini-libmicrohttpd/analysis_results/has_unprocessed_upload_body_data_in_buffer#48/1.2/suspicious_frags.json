  "explanation": "I examined the code for use of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm/asm, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_*, __declspec, #pragma with compiler-specific tokens, __extension__, nonstandard pointer qualifiers, or other documented compiler extensions). I found none of these tokens or constructs in the fragment. The uses present are standard C constructs: 'static', the 'bool' type (standard since C99 via <stdbool.h>), pointer dereferences, integer comparisons (0 != ...), and comments. The macro mhd_assert appears but is just a macro invocation \u2014 there is no evidence in this fragment that it expands to a compiler extension (its expansion is not shown). Returning an integer expression that evaluates to 0/1 is standard implicit conversion to _Bool and is not a compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions and nothing needs to be reported for Rule 1.2."
