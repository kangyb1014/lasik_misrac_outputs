  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The sole parameter is the pointer 'c'; the code only reads members of the object pointed to (c->state, c->rq.*, c->read_buffer_offset) and does not assign to 'c' itself or to any of its members. There are no assignments, increments/decrements, or pointer reassignments involving the parameter. The mhd_assert usages evaluate expressions only and do not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
