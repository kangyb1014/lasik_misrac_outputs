  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they are not controlling expressions (e.g. return statements, comments, and the final return expression), or are plain declarations/definitions. There are no explicit loop constructs (while/for/do) or switch statements in this function body other than the identified assertions and if statements. The identified mhd_assert lines were included because the assert macro may expand into control constructs in some builds; the two if statements are the only explicit controlling statements in the code and thus warrant inspection for potential invariant controlling expressions. Other code lines do not create controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
