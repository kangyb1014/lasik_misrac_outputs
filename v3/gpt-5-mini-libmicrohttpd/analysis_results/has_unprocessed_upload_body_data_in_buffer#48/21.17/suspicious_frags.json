  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in this function. The body contains only assertions, simple integer/boolean checks and returns based on structure members (have_chunked_upload, read_buffer_offset, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size, remaining_upload_size). Therefore there are no string-handling calls here that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Buffer manipulation or string handling (where the rule would apply) would need to be inspected in other functions that actually perform memcpy/strcpy/etc., but this function contains none of those calls and thus does not need further investigation for Rule 21.17."
