  "explanation": "Only the function parameter is a pointer type in the provided code. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-returning functions in this fragment. All accesses through the parameter 'c' are reads (no assignments to members of *c in this function), and no local pointers are declared \u2014 therefore no other code fragments require investigation for Rule 8.13 in this snippet."
