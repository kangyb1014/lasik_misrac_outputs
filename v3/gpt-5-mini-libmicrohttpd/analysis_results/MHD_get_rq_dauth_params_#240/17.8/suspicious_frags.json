  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The only function parameter is 'connection' (type struct MHD_Connection *). This code does not reassign the parameter itself anywhere (no statements like 'connection = ...'). All modifications are to members of the object pointed to by 'connection' (e.g., connection->rq.dauth_tried, connection->rq.dauth), which is explicitly allowed by the rule. Local pointers (dauth) and calls that pass 'connection' as an argument do not modify the parameter variable within this function. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 17.8."
