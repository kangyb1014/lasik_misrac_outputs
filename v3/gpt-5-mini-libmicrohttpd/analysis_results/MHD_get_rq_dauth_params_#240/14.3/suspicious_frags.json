  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are compile-time invariant. Each conditional depends on runtime state or a function return: \n- mhd_assert(MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED <= connection->state) depends on connection->state (and is an assertion macro).\n- if (connection->rq.dauth_tried) depends on a runtime field.\n- if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state) depends on connection->state.\n- if (! find_auth_rq_header_(...)) depends on the return value of a function call.\n- if (NULL == dauth) depends on the result of MHD_connection_alloc_memory_.\n- if (parse_dauth_params(...)) depends on the return value of a parser.\n\nThere are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant controlling expressions, and none of the shown if-expressions are invariant constants. Therefore no code fragments in this function need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 based on the visible code. If any of the used macros (e.g. mhd_assert) expand to constructs with invariant controlling expressions, their expansions would need review, but those expansions are not present in the provided source.
