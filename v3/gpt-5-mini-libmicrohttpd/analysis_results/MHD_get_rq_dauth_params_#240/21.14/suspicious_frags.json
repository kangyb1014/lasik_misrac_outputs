  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body and there are no calls to the Standard Library function memcmp (nor any obvious macro-wrapped aliases of memcmp) in this code fragment. The only standard library function used here is memset, which does not relate to Rule 21.14. Comparisons present are pointer/NULL checks and integer comparisons of connection state, not string comparisons via memcmp. Helper functions called from here (find_auth_rq_header_, parse_dauth_params, MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, etc.) are external to this fragment; if those implementations are available they should be inspected for memcmp usage, but within the given code there are no memcmp uses to flag for MISRA Rule 21.14."
