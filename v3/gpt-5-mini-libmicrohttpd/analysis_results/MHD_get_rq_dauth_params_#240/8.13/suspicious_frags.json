  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not selected because they do not raise issues specific to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Specifically:\n- The header/lookup logic (find_auth_rq_header_ and use of h_auth_value) primarily reads header data and does not introduce pointer-to-non-const objects that should be const-qualified here.\n- The boolean flags and NULL assignments (connection->rq.dauth_tried, connection->rq.dauth = NULL, return NULL) are control-flow/state updates and do not indicate missing const qualification.\n- Logging branches and early returns do not affect pointer type qualifiers.\n- Calls to functions that allocate or parse memory are invocation points; the suspicious fragments already include the allocation, initialization (memset) and subsequent assignment/return which are the relevant sites for const-qualification concerns. \nThe listed fragments cover places where a non-const pointer is declared, initialized, modified and stored/returned \u2014 these are the locations that should be investigated for possible use of const-qualified pointer types. No other code lines in the function present a likely Rule 8.13 concern."
