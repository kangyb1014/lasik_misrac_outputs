  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Reasons why specific constructs do NOT require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2:\n\n- The line-split string literals using a backslash-newline (e.g. _ (\"...\" \\ \n                 \"...\");) are standard C preprocessing behavior (line splicing and adjacent string literal concatenation), not a compiler extension.\n- Use of true/false is the standard C boolean convention (stdbool.h / C99 and later); it is not a compiler extension.\n- C casts (e.g. (struct MHD_RqDAuth *) ...) and sizeof are standard C features.\n- Conditional compilation via #ifdef/#endif and macro invocations (MHD_DLOG, mhd_assert, MHD_connection_alloc_memory_) are standard preprocessor features, not language extensions.\n- Standard library functions and idioms such as memset and NULL usage are standard C.\n- Identifier naming (leading/trailing underscores, e.g. functions/structs with underscores) is a portability/reserved-identifier concern under the C standard, but it is not a compiler language extension and therefore outside the scope of Rule 1.2 reporting here.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof (GNU extension), statement expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, C++-only constructs, or other documented compiler-specific keywords) were present in the snippet. Therefore there are no fragments to flag under Rule 1.2."
