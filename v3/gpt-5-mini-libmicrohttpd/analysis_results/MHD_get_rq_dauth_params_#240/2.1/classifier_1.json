  "scenario": "The single statement is a runtime assertion checking a precondition; it does not itself create code that can never be executed. Therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated. (Hypothetical violating scenario: if mhd_assert were implemented as an unconditional trap or as a macro that expands to something that makes the remainder of the function provably unreachable for all possible executions \u2014 or if the condition were a compile\u2011time constant that makes the following code impossible to reach \u2014 then Rule 2.1 could be violated.)"
