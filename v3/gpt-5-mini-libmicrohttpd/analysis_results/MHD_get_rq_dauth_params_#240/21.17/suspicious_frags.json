  "explanation": "Only these fragments involve string/buffer data that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses or rely on correct length/termination handling: the call to find_auth_rq_header_ (which produces h_auth_value.str and h_auth_value.len and therefore must ensure the buffer/length are consistent), the call to parse_dauth_params (which receives a pointer+length and may use string.h functions internally), and the direct use of memset. Other code fragments do not use <string.h> functions nor perform pointer/length-based string operations: the allocation via MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ is immediately checked for NULL before use; the assignment and flag updates (connection->rq.dauth, connection->rq.dauth_tried) are simple pointer/flag manipulations; the mhd_assert and state checks control flow but do not perform string operations. The memset line is included because it is a direct use of a <string.h> function; although the size passed equals the allocation size and dauth is checked for NULL, the call is still relevant to verify against Rule 21.17. No other lines in this function invoke the standard string handling functions listed in Rule 21.17."
