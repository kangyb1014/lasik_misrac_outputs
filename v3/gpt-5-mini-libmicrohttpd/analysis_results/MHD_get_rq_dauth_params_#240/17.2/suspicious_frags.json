  "explanation": "Only function-call expressions (including macros that may expand to function calls) can introduce direct or indirect recursion. The fragments listed above include all function-call sites and macro invocations in this routine that could, in principle, call back into MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_ (directly or indirectly) and therefore should be investigated. Other code in the function consists of simple assignments, field accesses, comparisons, return statements, and the call to the standard library routine memset \u2014 none of which can by themselves cause the function to call itself. Consequently those non-call statements do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
