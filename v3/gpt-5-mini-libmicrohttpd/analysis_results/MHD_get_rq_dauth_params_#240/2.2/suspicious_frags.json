  "explanation": "The remaining statements in the function implement essential control flow, resource management and result delivery and therefore are not candidates for dead-code removal. Declarations of local variables, the initial early-return that returns a cached result, the invocation of the parsing routine and the final return value are all observable by callers (they affect return values, allocation status or timing) and so their removal would alter program behaviour. Conditional compilation blocks that are not listed above only affect diagnostics/output and are guarded by feature macros. Therefore those other fragments should not be treated as dead code without deeper cross-module analysis; the reported fragments are the parts that warrant investigation for potential unnecessary/ineffectual operations."
