True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe memset(&p, 0, sizeof(p)) is redundant: every pollfd element that can be read later is explicitly assigned (fd, events, revents) before use, and only the first poll_count entries are passed to poll(). Removing this memset would not change program behaviour (the function returns early if poll_count==0 and any accessed entries are initialized). Therefore the memset is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The memset(&p, 0, sizeof(p)) is redundant in the shown function. Only the first poll_count entries of p are ever observed by poll (MHD_sys_poll_ is called with poll_count), and the function returns early if poll_count == 0. For every entry that can later be read (those at indices that get poll_listen or poll_itc_idx set), the code explicitly assigns fd, events and revents (including setting revents = 0) before calling poll. After poll returns the code only examines revents for those same indices. Thus removing the memset does not change any program behaviour in the current code, so the memset constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nNote: There are defensive/security reasons a maintainer might choose to keep the memset (e.g. to avoid leaking prior stack contents into kernel/user buffers or to guard against nonconforming platform behavior), but that does not change the fact that, as written, the memset is executed yet unnecessary for the function\u2019s observable behaviour, and therefore meets the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2."
