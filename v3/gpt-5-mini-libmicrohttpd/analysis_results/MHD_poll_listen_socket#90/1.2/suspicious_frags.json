  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the provided function text. The code only uses standard C constructs (local array declaration, casts, assignment in conditions, function calls, preprocessor conditional #ifdef, enum return type, standard library memset, etc.). Specifically, I checked for known compiler extensions that must be avoided (and would be suspicious if present):\n- GNU extensions such as statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, labels-as-values (&&label), nested functions, __attribute__ or __extension__ markers, __asm__ inline assembly, __builtin_* intrinsics, or varargs/extended macros \u2014 none appear in the snippet.\n- Non-standard declarations such as variable-length arrays or flexible array members are not used here (the array p[2] is a fixed-size array).\n- Designated initializers, compound literals, or other C99/C11 features that some compilers treat specially are not present.\n\nCaveat: some identifiers in the code are macros or wrappers (for example MHD_sys_poll_, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, MHD_itc_r_fd_, MHD_socket_get_error_, MHD_DLOG, mhd_assert, etc.). Those macro or function definitions are not included in this snippet; if any of those macros/functions/headers use compiler-specific extensions (e.g. inline assembly, __attribute__, statement-expressions) that would be an extension, they are not visible here and should be inspected separately. Based on the visible code alone, there are no language-extension constructs to report."
