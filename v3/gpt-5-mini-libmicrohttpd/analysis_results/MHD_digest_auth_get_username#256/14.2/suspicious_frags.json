First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in the provided function. Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops being well-formed; because there are no for loops in this code fragment, there are no in-function locations that need investigation for this rule. The function contains only declarations, if-statements, calls to other functions (MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_, get_rq_uname_type, get_rq_unames_size, MHD_calloc_, get_rq_uname), a memset and a free \u2014 none are for loops. Note: implementations of the called functions are not present here; if you want full coverage for Rule 14.2 you must also provide the source of those functions (or any macros used) because any for loops in their bodies would need to be checked. The current fragment itself does not contain any code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
