  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided snippet. The code does not contain vendor-specific keywords or tokens that are documented compiler extensions, such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof (as a GCC extension), __inline__ (implementation-specific forms), or #pragma with vendor-specific pragmas. All constructs shown are standard C: enums, size_t, casts, function calls, standard block scope and memset/free usage. The identifiers/macros starting with or containing underscores (for example _MHD_EXTERN or function names ending with an underscore) may be macros that in other translation units expand to implementation-specific attributes, but that expansion is not visible here. Per the instruction to report only explicitly used compiler extensions, these cannot be flagged based solely on this snippet, so no fragments are reported for investigation."
