  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function; there is no use of the Standard Library function memcmp anywhere in this code fragment. The only standard library or runtime functions called here are MHD_calloc_ (allocation), memset, and free \u2014 none of which violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. All string/byte handling in this function is done via get_rq_uname (which fills the username buffer) and subsequent checks against enum values; comparisons in this function are enum/value comparisons, not memcmp-based string comparisons.\n\nNote: helper functions called here (e.g. get_rq_uname, get_rq_unames_size, get_rq_uname_type, MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_) are external to this snippet. If you need to ensure Rule 21.14 holds project-wide, those functions should be reviewed separately for any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. However, within the provided code fragment itself there are no instances that require investigation under Rule 21.14."
