  "explanation": "Only operations that can affect or rely on buffer bounds and usage by string.h functions need investigation for MISRA C Rule 21.17. The code contains a single direct string.h function call (memset) and several related buffer-size/usage operations (computing buf_size, allocating username, passing username and buf_size to get_rq_uname, and the subsequent assertion). These fragments must be checked together to ensure no access beyond the allocated username buffer (e.g. whether get_rq_unames_size returns a correct size including any required terminator, whether get_rq_uname respects the provided buf_size when writing, and whether the post-call check prevents out-of-bounds access). Other lines (parameter retrieval, enum checks, NULL checks, free(username), (void) used, returns, simple assignments) do not call string.h functions nor manipulate buffers in a way that could lead to accesses beyond object bounds, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
