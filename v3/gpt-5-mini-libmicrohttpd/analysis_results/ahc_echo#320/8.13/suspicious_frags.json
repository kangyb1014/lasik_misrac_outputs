  "explanation": "I selected the function parameter declarations and the local static 'aptr' and the places where its address is stored through req_cls because these are the locations where pointer targets are non-const and thus potentially subject to Rule 8.13. Other fragments were not selected because they either already use const (const char *url/method/version/upload_data), are unused casts to void (these suppress warnings but do not change pointee qualification), or involve API objects passed to library functions (struct MHD_Connection *, struct MHD_Response *) where the external API likely requires non-const pointers and the function simply forwards opaque pointers; those cases need API-level checking and are less likely to be candidates for const-qualification within this local implementation."
