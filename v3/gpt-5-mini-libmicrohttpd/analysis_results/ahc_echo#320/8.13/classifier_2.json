  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment declares an object (static int aptr;), not a pointer type. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 addresses pointer declarations pointing to non-const-qualified types; it does not apply to a plain int object. Note: aptr could be made const since it is only used as an address sentinel, but changing it to const would require casts when assigning its address to a void* (which would discard qualifiers), so the current declaration does not violate Rule 8.13."
