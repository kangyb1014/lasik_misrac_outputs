  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided code. The constructs used are standard C: a normal function definition and prototype, a function-local static variable (static int aptr), enum type usage (enum MHD_Result), pointer and address operations (&aptr, *req_cls), standard casts to void to silence unused-parameter warnings, and calls to library functions/macros (MHD_create_response_from_callback, MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN, MHD_queue_response). There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly (asm), Microsoft-specific declspecs, or other documented compiler extensions. Library macros/identifiers that begin with MHD_ are API/library-specific but are not language/compiler extensions and therefore are not flagged here."
