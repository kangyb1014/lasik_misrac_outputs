  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters (the parameter variables themselves). The only places in this function that interact with a pointer parameter in a way that could be mistaken for modifying a parameter are the uses of req_cls (void **). The three fragments listed read and assign through req_cls (comparison and two assignments to *req_cls) and therefore should be inspected to confirm that the code modifies the object pointed-to (which is allowed) and does not reassign the parameter variable req_cls itself (which would violate the rule). All other lines either cast unused parameters to void (no modification), perform reads (e.g., strcmp(method,...)), call functions using parameters (e.g., MHD_queue_response(connection,...)), or operate on local/static objects (aptr, response) and do not modify parameter variables, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
