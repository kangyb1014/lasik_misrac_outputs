  "explanation": "The remaining code implements run-time behaviour (method check via strcmp, per-request handshake using the sentinel &aptr and *req_cls, creation/queuing/destruction of the response and returning the result). Removing or altering those fragments would change program behaviour (e.g. accepting only GET, suppressing the first response, building and sending the response), so they are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2. The static variable declaration 'static int aptr;' is used as a persistent sentinel (its address is stored in *req_cls) so it affects behaviour and is not dead. There is no unreachable code in the function; every statement outside the void-casts contributes to control flow or observable effects and thus should not be investigated for dead-code under Rule 2.2."
