  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not correct. The lines like '(void) upload_data_size;' are the conventional way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to silence compiler warnings. Although the expression statement has no runtime side\u2011effects, its presence documents intent and affects compile\u2011time diagnostics; MISRA\u2019s concern with \u201cdead code\u201d is about code that serves no purpose and could be removed without affecting program behaviour or intent. The cast\u2011to\u2011void is a deliberate, benign idiom and is not the kind of unreachable or functionally redundant code that Rule 2.2 aims to prohibit. Therefore the claim that this specific statement violates Rule 2.2 is not correct."
