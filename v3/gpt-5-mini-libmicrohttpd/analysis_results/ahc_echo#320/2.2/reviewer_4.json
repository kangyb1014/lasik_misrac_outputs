  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The cast-to-void statements such as \"(void) url;\" are the conventional, deliberate idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to silence compiler diagnostics. MISRA\u2019s intent with Rule 2.2 is to forbid executed operations that are gratuitous in the sense that removing them would not affect the program\u2019s observable behaviour; however, the (void) parameter idiom is an explicit annotation of intent (and may affect generated code/timing on some platforms) and is a recognised way to avoid spurious warnings. In practice MISRA guidance accepts clearly intentional uses to name an unused parameter (or to use the (void) param idiom) rather than treating them as forbidden dead code. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim that the code violates Rule 2.2 because of \"(void) url;\" is incorrect."
