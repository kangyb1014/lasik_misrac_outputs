  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they do not introduce direct or indirect calls back into ahc_echo: the (void) casts simply silence unused-parameter warnings; declarations and initializations (static int aptr; struct MHD_Response *response; enum MHD_Result ret;) are inert; the method check using strcmp and the immediate return of MHD_NO are simple library usage that cannot cause a callback into this handler; the assignment *req_cls = NULL; and the final return ret are ordinary state updates/returns and do not perform calls that could re-enter the function. The selected fragments were chosen because they either manage re-entry state (*req_cls = &aptr; return MHD_YES;) or invoke library facilities that accept callbacks or may trigger request handling (MHD_create_response_from_callback with &data_generator, MHD_queue_response, and MHD_destroy_response) and therefore warrant investigation for possible indirect recursion."
