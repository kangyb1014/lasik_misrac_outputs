  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. This code does not call memcmp anywhere. The only string comparison present is strcmp(method, \"GET\"), which is the correct function to use for null-terminated strings. Other operations are pointer comparisons (&aptr != *req_cls) and calls to MHD_* APIs; none of these involve memcmp or improper comparison of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
