  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 because this function contains no direct self-call and no other function calls or function-pointer invocations. The only function calls present are the two calls to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (listed above); those are the only places that could create indirect recursion (if SHA1ProcessMessageBlock calls back to SHA1PadMessage, directly or via another chain). All remaining code lines are assignments and loop constructs operating on context->message_block and length fields and do not affect compliance with Rule 17.2."
