  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression depends on the mutable structure member context->message_block_index, so it is not an invariant. This would only violate Rule 14.3 if message_block_index were effectively invariant (for example if it were a compile-time constant, a const-qualified constant never modified, or replaced by a literal/macro), which is not the case in the shown code (the code later increments message_block_index), so the rule is not violated."
