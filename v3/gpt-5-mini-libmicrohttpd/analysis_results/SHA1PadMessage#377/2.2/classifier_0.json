  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1PadMessage:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1PadMessage (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (context->message_block_index > 55)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 64)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n    SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  context->message_block[56] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 24);\n  context->message_block[57] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 16);\n  context->message_block[58] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 8);\n  context->message_block[59] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high);\n  context->message_block[60] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 24);\n  context->message_block[61] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 16);\n  context->message_block[62] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 8);\n  context->message_block[63] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low);\n  SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nSHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(context) is executed on the final padded block in all control-flow paths (in the if-path it is executed after preparing the final block; in the else-path it is the sole processing call). Removing this call would prevent the final (length-appended) block from being processed and thus change the SHA-1 output. Therefore it is not dead code."
