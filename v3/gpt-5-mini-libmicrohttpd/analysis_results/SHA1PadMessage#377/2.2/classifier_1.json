  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1PadMessage:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1PadMessage (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (context->message_block_index > 55)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 64)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n    SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  context->message_block[56] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 24);\n  context->message_block[57] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 16);\n  context->message_block[58] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 8);\n  context->message_block[59] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high);\n  context->message_block[60] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 24);\n  context->message_block[61] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 16);\n  context->message_block[62] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 8);\n  context->message_block[63] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low);\n  SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontext->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement writes the 0x80 byte (the required '1' bit for SHA-1 padding) into the message_block and increments the index. This write is used in the immediately processed block (when message_block_index > 55) or retained in the current block before filling zeros up to byte 56 (when message_block_index <= 55). Removing this operation would change the padded message and thus the resulting hash, so it is not dead code."
