  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code writes into context->message_block, so the pointer must refer to a modifiable object and cannot/should not be const. A violation of Rule 8.13 would occur if the pointed-to data were not modified anywhere and the pointer was declared without const (e.g. a function parameter declared as unsigned char *buf that is only read and could be const unsigned char *), or if const was cast away to allow this write (e.g. context declared const struct SHA1Context * but cast to non-const to perform the assignment)."
