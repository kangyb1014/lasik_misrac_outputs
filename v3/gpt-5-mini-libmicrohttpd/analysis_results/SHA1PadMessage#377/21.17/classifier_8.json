  "scenario": "No \u2014 Rule 21.17 is not violated. The statement is a direct indexed write and does not call any <string.h> string-handling function (Rule 21.17 applies only to those functions). Note: this write is safe only if context->message_block is at least 64 bytes long (index 59 is within 0..63). If message_block were smaller (e.g. <60 bytes) the code would have an out-of-bounds access, but that would be a general bounds error, not a violation of Rule 21.17 which specifically concerns <string.h> functions."
