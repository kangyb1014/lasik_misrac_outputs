  "explanation": "All listed fragments perform direct indexing/writing into context->message_block and therefore could potentially access beyond the buffer bounds depending on the value of message_block_index or the assumed size of message_block; they must be investigated for out-of-bounds accesses. Other lines in the function are control-flow constructs or calls (e.g. SHA1ProcessMessageBlock) and do not themselves perform array indexing or call any <string.h> functions, so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation here."
