  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs a direct array write and does not call any function from <string.h>. Rule 21.17 applies to use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.), so this line by itself does not violate it. Note: this write is safe under the assumption that message_block is at least 64 bytes long (the surrounding code uses indices 0..63). A concrete Rule 21.17 violation would be, for example, calling memcpy(context->message_block + 58, src, 10) when only 6 bytes remain in message_block, which would result in an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access via a <string.h> function."
