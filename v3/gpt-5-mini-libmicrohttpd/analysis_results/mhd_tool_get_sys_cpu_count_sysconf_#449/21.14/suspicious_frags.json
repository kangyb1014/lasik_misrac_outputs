  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any string comparison functions like strcmp/strncmp) in the provided code. The fragment only calls sysconf, performs numeric checks on a long value, and casts to int with an overflow check. There are no operations on null\u2011terminated strings or char* comparisons that could trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14, so there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for this rule."
