  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The default: break; inside the switch is executed when control reaches the default label, but removing that break would not change the program behaviour (control would still exit the switch and continue with the subsequent if). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 a statement that is executed yet whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code, so the break; here constitutes dead code. (To fix, remove the redundant break or refactor the default branch so it has a meaningful effect or is otherwise intentionally documented/justified.)"
