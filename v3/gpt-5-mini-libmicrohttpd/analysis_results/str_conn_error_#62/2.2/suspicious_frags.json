The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could represent dead code and therefore merit investigation: the whole static function header (the function may be unused at project level), the default-break (a break at the end of a switch can be redundant), the post-switch check and return for non-negative codes (may be redundant if all such values are already handled or never occur), the assert call that is documented as \"Should never be reachable\" (may be compiled out or never executed), and the final return following the assert (may be unreachable or only present to satisfy the compiler). Other code fragments were not flagged because they are explicit mappings from specific error constants to user-visible strings (each case labels returns a distinct string). Those case-return statements perform observable actions (produce different return values for different inputs); removing or altering them would change program behaviour, so they are not candidates for dead-code removal under MISRA C Rule 2.2. The switch structure itself and the per-case return statements are therefore not reported as suspicious."
