  ],
  "explanation": "All switch cases each return directly and are reachable when mhd_err_code equals the corresponding case constant, so those fragments do not need investigation. The default: break; path falls through to the subsequent if/return logic and is intentionally present to silence a compiler warning, so the default branch itself is not necessarily unreachable. The if (0 <= mhd_err_code) return _ (\"Not an error code\"); line is reachable for non\u2011negative values. Therefore the only fragments that warrant investigation for potential unreachable\u2011code issues are the assertion line and the final return statement listed above."
