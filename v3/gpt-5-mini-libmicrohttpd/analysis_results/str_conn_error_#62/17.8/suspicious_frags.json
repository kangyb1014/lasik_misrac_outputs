  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter mhd_err_code (type ssize_t) is only read: it is used as the switch expression and in a comparison (if (0 <= mhd_err_code)). There are no assignments to mhd_err_code, no increment/decrement, and no operations that modify it. There are also no pointer parameters in this function (so the pointer-related portion of Rule 17.8 does not apply). Other constructs (return statements, mhd_assert, and the default break) do not modify the parameter. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
