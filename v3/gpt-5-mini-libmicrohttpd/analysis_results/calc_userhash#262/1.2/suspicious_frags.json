  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The function signature and body use standard C constructs: parameter types (size_t, uint8_t) and the inline function style are standard. There are no visible GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __inline__ (as a nonstandard spelling), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords. The identifier _MHD_static_inline is a macro name in this snippet; its presence alone is not an explicit use of a compiler extension \u2014 the macro expansion (not shown) would need to be inspected to determine whether it expands to a compiler-specific extension. Similarly, other identifiers (mhd_assert, digest_update, etc.) are plain identifiers and not language extensions. For these reasons there are no code fragments in the provided snippet that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions and therefore nothing to report for Rule 1.2 based on the given code alone."
