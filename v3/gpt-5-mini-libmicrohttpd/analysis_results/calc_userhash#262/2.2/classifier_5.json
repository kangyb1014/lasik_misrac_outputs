  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userhash:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userhash (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n               const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n               const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n               uint8_t *digest_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != username);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, digest_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigest_update (da, username, username_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The call digest_update(da, username, username_len) is not dead in the shown context \u2014 it contributes data to the digest; removing it would change the computed hash, so Rule 2.2 is not violated. (A violation would occur if the called routine were a no\u2011op in all builds \u2014 e.g. digest_update is implemented as an empty function or is compiled out by preprocessor macros \u2014 in which case the call would be dead code.)"
