  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userhash:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userhash (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n               const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n               const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n               uint8_t *digest_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != username);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, digest_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (NULL != username);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in typical use: mhd_assert(NULL != username) is a runtime check (usually expands to a check that aborts or reports on failure). Its presence can change program behaviour if the assertion fails, so it is not dead code. A violation would only occur in a specific situation where the assertion is actually an executed no-op whose removal cannot affect behaviour \u2014 for example if the project defines mhd_assert as an expression with no effect and the condition is provably always true at run time (so the statement is executed but has no observable effect). In the given fragment, assuming mhd_assert implements a real runtime check, Rule 2.2 is not violated."
