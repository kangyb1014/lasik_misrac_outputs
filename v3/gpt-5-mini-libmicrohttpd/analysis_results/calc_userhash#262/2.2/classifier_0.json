  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userhash:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userhash (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n               const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n               const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n               uint8_t *digest_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != username);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, digest_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigest_calc_hash (da, digest_bin);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call digest_calc_hash(da, digest_bin) finalizes the digest and writes the result into digest_bin; removing it would change program behaviour (the computed hash would not be produced). This call is therefore not dead code. (It would only be a violation if digest_calc_hash were a no-op/no side-effects and its removal did not affect the observable behaviour.)"
