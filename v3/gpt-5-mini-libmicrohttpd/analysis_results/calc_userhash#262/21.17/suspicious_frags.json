  "explanation": "The snippet contains no direct calls to <string.h> routines, so only calls that may internally invoke string-handling functions need investigation. The function signature and the assertions (mhd_assert (NULL != username); mhd_assert (! da->hashing);) do not themselves call any <string.h> functions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17. Likewise, the parameter declarations and other boilerplate lines do not perform memory accesses and are outside the scope of this rule. The four listed calls are the only places in this fragment that could internally use memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/etc. and therefore must be checked to ensure they do not access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters."
