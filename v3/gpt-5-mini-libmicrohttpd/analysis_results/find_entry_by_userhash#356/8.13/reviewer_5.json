True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'entry' is only used to read fields (passed to memcmp) and is never used to modify the pointed object. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should therefore point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct UserEntry *entry). As written it is a non-const pointer despite only performing read-only accesses, so the rule is violated. (If the function deliberately must return a modifiable struct UserEntry * to callers, the return type should be changed or a documented justification provided.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The local pointer 'entry' is returned from the function as a struct UserEntry *; therefore it cannot be made a pointer-to-const without changing the function API or inserting a cast that would discard constness (which would itself violate other MISRA rules). Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when that is possible without changing semantics; here making 'entry' a 'const struct UserEntry *' is not possible if the function must return a modifiable struct UserEntry *. If the intent is that callers must not modify the returned entry, the correct fix is to change the function return type to 'const struct UserEntry *' (or otherwise document/justify the non-const return). As written, given the function returns a non-const pointer, the local non-const 'entry' is appropriate and the reported violation of 8.13 is not valid."
