True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'entry' is declared as 'struct UserEntry *entry' but is only used for read-only access (its members are compared via memcmp). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry' or making the userhash arrays const). Although memcmp takes 'const void *' and the conversion is allowed, the code should use a const-qualified pointer here.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. While the local variable entry is only used for read-only access inside the function, it is also returned by the function as struct UserEntry *. You cannot simply change the local pointer to const struct UserEntry * without either (a) changing the function's return type to const struct UserEntry * (an API change) or (b) casting away const when returning (which would itself violate other MISRA rules). Rule 8.13 asks for const qualification where possible, but in this context qualifying the local pointer as const is not possible without a wider change to the API or unsafe casts. If the underlying user_ids objects are intrinsically immutable, the proper fix would be to make them const and then propagate const to the function return type; otherwise the current code is acceptable and the reported violation is not correct."
