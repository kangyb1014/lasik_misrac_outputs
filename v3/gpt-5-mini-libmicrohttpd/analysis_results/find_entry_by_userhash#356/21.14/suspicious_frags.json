  "explanation": "Only calls to the Standard Library comparison function memcmp are potentially relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). All other fragments in the function (switch/case, size checks using MHD_digest_get_hash_size and sizeof, loop indexing, variable declarations, and return statements) do not invoke memcmp or otherwise perform string comparisons and therefore do not need investigation under this rule. The three memcmp occurrences are the only locations that must be reviewed to determine whether the compared objects are null-terminated strings (which would violate the rule) or fixed-size binary hash buffers (which would be acceptable)."
