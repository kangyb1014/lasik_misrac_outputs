True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe per-algorithm sizeof check is redundant given the earlier guard. The function first returns NULL if MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) != userhash_size, and for the SHA512_256 case MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) is expected to equal sizeof(user_ids[0].userhash_sha512_256). Therefore the subsequent 'if (sizeof(user_ids[0].userhash_sha512_256) != userhash_size) return NULL;' is an executed operation (the comparison) whose removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 the check will never be true and its return would never fire. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA 2.2 forbids code that is executed yet provably removable without changing program behaviour. The per-algorithm sizeof checks in this function are defensive guards that compare the stored hash-field size to the incoming userhash_size; they are reachable and only provably redundant if, for every possible value of algo3, MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) is guaranteed (and provably so across the whole project) to equal sizeof(user_ids[0].<corresponding_field>). From the excerpt provided there is no proof of that invariant. Removing the checks would change behaviour in any scenario where the mapping between MHD_digest_get_hash_size and the actual sizeof fields differs (due to a bug, a future change, or different handling of session variants), so the comparisons are not necessarily dead code. If, however, you can show project-wide that MHD_digest_get_hash_size() is implemented in terms of those exact sizeof expressions (and that the relationship cannot change), then the checks would be provably redundant \u2014 only in that stronger, project-wide case would Agent A\u2019s claim be correct."
