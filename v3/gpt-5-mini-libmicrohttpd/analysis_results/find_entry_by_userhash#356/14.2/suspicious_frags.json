First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The three for-loop blocks above are flagged for investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 because they are the loop constructs whose clauses and interactions with the loop body (including the called function memcmp and uses of user_ids and entry) must be checked. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for this rule: the initial size checks and switch cases are not for-statements; the loop counter (i) is declared once and explicitly initialized in the first clause (i = 0); each loop\u2019s second clause uses a constant expression based on sizeof and the loop counter only; the third clause increments only the loop counter (++i); and the loop body does not visibly modify i. Therefore only the for-loop fragments require closer inspection to ensure there are no hidden side-effects (for example from called functions or aliasing) that would violate the rule."
