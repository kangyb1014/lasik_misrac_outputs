  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: enums, structs, size_t, sizeof, pointer arithmetic (entry = user_ids + i), switch/case (stacked case labels for intentional fall-through), memcmp, and comments. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, inline assembly, nonstandard calling conventions, pragmas that enable extensions, or GCC/MSVC-specific keywords. The presence of a case for MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_INVALID to mute a compiler warning is a standard technique and not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
