  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions in the function do not appear to be invariant and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 14.3:\n- The initial check if (MHD_digest_get_hash_size (algo3) != userhash_size) depends on the function parameters (algo3 and userhash_size) and so is not an invariant.\n- The switch (algo3) controlling expression depends on the input parameter algo3; the various case blocks are selected at run time.\n- The for loops (for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); ++i)) have a loop-control expression that depends on the loop variable i; although the upper bound is a compile-time constant, the condition is not invariant because i changes.\n- The memcmp-based ifs (if (0 == memcmp (...))) compare run-time data and are not invariant.\n- The case label for MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_INVALID / default is a switch label to silence a compiler warning; it does not constitute an invariant controlling expression.\n\nThe three flagged if-expressions compare a compile-time sizeof(...) with the runtime parameter userhash_size and are preceded by an earlier check that already compares userhash_size to the digest size for the selected algo. Those repeated sizeof checks are likely redundant and therefore merit investigation to determine whether they are invariant (always true/false) in practice and thus potentially violate Rule 14.3."
