  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls):\n\n- The function body contains no call expression that names check_param__epoll; there is no direct recursive call.\n- The only function calls in the snippet are to MHD_is_feature_supported and fprintf. Neither is a function pointer call nor shows any mechanism by which they would invoke check_param__epoll back (no callback or function-pointer parameter is used here). There is no evidence in this fragment of mutual recursion.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences, no assignments of this function to a pointer, and no macro expansions present that could hide a recursive call.\n- The function is declared static (internal linkage), and within this isolated snippet there is no construct that would indicate indirect recursion.\n\nIf recursion via other translation units or via a function pointer stored/used elsewhere is a concern, that would require inspection of other code that assigns or uses pointers to this function; however, nothing in this fragment indicates such behavior, so no further fragments from this snippet need investigation for Rule 17.2."
