  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__epoll:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__epoll (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.epoll)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"'epoll' was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support 'epoll' functionality.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! tool_params.epoll)\n    return ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The early return if (!tool_params.epoll) returns 1 when epoll is not requested. Removing this statement would change program behaviour because the function would continue to call MHD_is_feature_supported and could print an error or return 0 even when epoll was not requested. Therefore this operation is not dead code."
