Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in this small function are structural or part of the conditional/control flow and do not appear to be dead code by themselves: the function signature and braces, the call to MHD_is_feature_supported as used in the if-condition (its result affects control flow), and the return 0 within the reported if-block are already covered by the flagged fragment. The flagged fragments are those that could indicate redundant/always-true returns or unreachable/never-effective message/return paths and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead-code violations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. No other separate lines or statements remain that would be reasonable candidates for dead-code inspection in this function."
