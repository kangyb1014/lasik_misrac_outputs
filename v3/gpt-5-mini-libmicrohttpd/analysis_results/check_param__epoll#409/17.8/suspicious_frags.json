  "explanation": "The function check_param__epoll has no parameters (signature uses void), so there are no function parameters that could be modified in its body. The code only reads a global (tool_params.epoll), performs comparisons, calls MHD_is_feature_supported and fprintf (passing arguments but not assigning to any parameter variables), and returns values \u2014 none of these actions assign to or modify a function parameter. Therefore no code fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 17.8."
