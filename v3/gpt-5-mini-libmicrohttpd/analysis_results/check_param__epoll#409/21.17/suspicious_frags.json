  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code fragment. The fragment contains: checks of tool_params.epoll, a call to MHD_is_feature_supported, fprintf with string literals, and return statements. None of these invoke memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other string-handling functions that could cause out-of-bounds access. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 compliance."
