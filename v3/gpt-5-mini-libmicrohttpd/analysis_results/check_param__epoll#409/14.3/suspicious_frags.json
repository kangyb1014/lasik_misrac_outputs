  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The two if conditions are: 1) if (!tool_params.epoll) \u2014 depends on the (mutable) variable tool_params.epoll; 2) if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL)) \u2014 depends on a function call result. There are no loops or selection statements with constant/compile-time invariant controlling expressions. The uses of the constant-computation '!0' appear only in return expressions, which are not controlling expressions and thus outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation under Rule 14.3."
