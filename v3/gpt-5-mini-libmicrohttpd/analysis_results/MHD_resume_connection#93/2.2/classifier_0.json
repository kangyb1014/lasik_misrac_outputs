  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_resume_connection:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN void\nMHD_resume_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n\n  if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Cannot resume connections without enabling \" \\\n                  \"MHD_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME!\\n\"));\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n#endif\n  connection->resuming = true;\n  daemon->resuming = true;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n#endif\n  if ( (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) &&\n       (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The mutex lock call is conditionally compiled: when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS is defined the call is executed and performs essential synchronization (paired with the later unlock). Removing it would change program behaviour in multithreaded builds, so it is not dead code. When the thread macros are not defined the call is not present at all (not unreachable/dead code)."
