  "scenario": "The expression compares daemon->worker_pool to NULL (read-only use). This single use does not itself violate Rule 8.13. A violation would occur if the member was declared as a non-const pointer but never modified anywhere \u2014 e.g. if worker_pool is declared as 'struct MHD_WorkerPool *worker_pool;' yet the object is only ever read, it should be declared 'const struct MHD_WorkerPool *worker_pool;'. The shown fragment does not show the declaration, so based on this fragment alone: no violation."
