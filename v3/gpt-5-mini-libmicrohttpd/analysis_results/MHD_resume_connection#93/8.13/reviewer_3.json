If MHD_DLOG (or the _() macro/gettext) is declared to take/return a non-const char * (e.g. char *), this discards the const-qualification of data that is not intended to be modified. In that situation the pointer should be declared as pointing to const (e.g. const char *) so the parameter and/or _() return type should be changed accordingly.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is speculative and cannot be confirmed from the snippet. Rule 8.13 is about pointer declarations (they should point to const-qualified types where possible). The shown function MHD_resume_connection does not declare any pointer-to-character parameter types itself \u2014 it merely passes the result of the translation macro _() into MHD_DLOG. Whether a Rule 8.13 violation exists depends on the declarations of _ (or gettext) and MHD_DLOG. If those APIs are declared to take/return non-const char * when they could use const char *, then those declarations would be the locus of a Rule 8.13 violation \u2014 but that is not visible in the provided code. Note also the C standard historical quirk: string literals have type char[] (not const char[]), and many gettext implementations return char *; that is a separate compatibility issue. Conclusion: based on the provided code alone, the report is not proven correct. To decide definitively you must inspect the declarations of _()/gettext and MHD_DLOG and, if they use non-const char * unnecessarily, change them to const char * (or otherwise justify the non-const)."
