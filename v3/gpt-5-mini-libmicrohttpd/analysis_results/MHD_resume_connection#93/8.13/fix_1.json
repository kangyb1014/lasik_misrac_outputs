  "explanation": "Fixes applied:\n- Changed casts of daemon->itc (a struct, not a pointer) to take its address: (void *)&daemon->itc.\n- Replaced use of the MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ macro and pointer-style activation with function-style checks: MHD_itc_is_valid_(&daemon->itc) and MHD_itc_activate_(&daemon->itc, \"r\").\n- Removed the _MHD_EXTERN token from the function declaration (it is a project macro outside this unit).\n- Replaced _() translation macro usages with plain string literals so the file does not depend on gettext macros.\n- Added minimal struct definitions and external function prototypes so this translation unit compiles standalone. No mock function definitions were added; only declarations were provided.\n\nThese changes preserve the original control flow and behavior while correcting type errors that caused the previous compile failure."
