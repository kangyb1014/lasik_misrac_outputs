  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment as written does not itself introduce unreachable code. The if() tests a run-time value (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME) and the MHD_PANIC call is executed only when that test is true, so following code can still be reached when the test is false. Therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated by this fragment. \n\nHowever, a violation could occur in a specific situation: if MHD_PANIC is a non-returning construct (e.g. expands to abort/exit/while(1) or is annotated noreturn) and the condition is provably always true at compile time (for example daemon->options is a compile-time constant with the bit always clear or preprocessor/configuration makes the test constant), then the code after this point would be statically unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
