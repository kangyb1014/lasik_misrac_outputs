  "explanation": "I reported every function-like call and macro invocation present in the fragment because any of these could (directly or indirectly) call MHD_resume_connection and thus create recursion. The remaining lines in the function are simple declarations, assignments (e.g. struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon; connection->resuming = true; daemon->resuming = true;), or preprocessor directives/conditional compilation markers; these do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
