  "explanation": "No calls to the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. The fragment only manipulates structure members and flags, uses mutex/helper macros, and passes string literals (e.g. \"Cannot resume...\", \"r\") to logging/utility macros or functions. String literals themselves do not trigger Rule 21.17; the rule targets uses of the string handling functions that can access beyond object bounds. Although some identifiers (MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG, MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_) are macros or functions, there is no evidence in this fragment that they invoke any <string.h> routines. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
