  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No use of <string.h> functions: the function compares characters by dereferencing str1 and str2 directly in a loop and does not call any of the standard string.h functions listed by MISRA Rule 21.17. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated. (Note: if callers pass non-null-terminated buffers then ordinary pointer dereference could still read out of bounds, but that is not a violation of Rule 21.17 which specifically concerns the <string.h> functions.)"
