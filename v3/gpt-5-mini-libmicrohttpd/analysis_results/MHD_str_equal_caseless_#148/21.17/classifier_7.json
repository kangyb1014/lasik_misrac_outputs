  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the fragment only dereferences str1 and does not call any <string.h> function. Rule 21.17 applies specifically to standard string.h functions (e.g. memcpy, strlen, strcpy, etc.). Note: a runtime out-of-bounds/dereference can still occur if str1 is NULL or not a pointer to a valid null-terminated object, but that would violate other rules (not 21.17). A concrete 21.17 violation scenario would be calling strlen(str1) or strcpy(dst,str1) when str1 is not null-terminated, which could read beyond the bounds of the referenced object."
