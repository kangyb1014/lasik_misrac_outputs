  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 were found. Reasoning: \n- Both pointer parameters are declared as pointing to const-qualified type (const char *str1, const char *str2), satisfying the rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. \n- There are no other pointer declarations in the function (no char * or other non-const pointer targets). \n- The local objects c1 and c2 are const char, not pointers, so they are not relevant to the rule. \n- The pointer arithmetic (str1++ and str2++) modifies the pointer values, not the pointed-to objects; the rule concerns the qualification of the pointed-to type, which is already const. \n- There are no casts that remove const qualification or other operations that would require investigation under this rule. \nTherefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
