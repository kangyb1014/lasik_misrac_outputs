  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant under Rule 14.3. The only loop/control expressions are:\n\n- while (0 != (*str1)) \u2014 str1 is incremented inside the loop (str1++), so the dereferenced value tested by the while condition can change each iteration; this is not an invariant controlling expression and not an infinite-loop literal.\n\n- if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2)) \u2014 this tests the result of a function call using c1 and c2, which are assigned from *str1 and *str2 at the start of each loop iteration; the values tested are therefore variant across iterations. The presence of the function call prevents this from being a compile-time invariant literal.\n\n- return 0 == (*str2); is a return expression, not a loop or branch controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3.\n\nNo do-while constant-false pattern or literal/constant controlling expression (e.g. while(1), while(0), for(;;)) appears. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
