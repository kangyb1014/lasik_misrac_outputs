  "explanation": "The function body contains only one function call site; that call site is listed above and should be investigated for possible indirect recursion. No other fragments in this function can introduce recursion: there is no direct call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_, no function-pointer invocation, no macro invocation visible in this code, and the remaining statements are local variable declarations, pointer dereferences, pointer increments, loop control and return expressions which cannot by themselves cause the function to call itself. Therefore only the shown call site needs investigation for compliance with Rule 17.2."
