  "explanation": "I found no calls to memcmp in the provided function. The code uses strcmp, strstr and strlen to work with null-terminated strings, but Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Since memcmp does not appear anywhere in this fragment (nor is there any obvious macro alias for memcmp), there are no code fragments that need investigation for this rule. All other string operations present (strcmp, strstr, strlen, and direct character indexing) are not violations of Rule 21.14 and therefore do not need to be reported for this specific rule."
