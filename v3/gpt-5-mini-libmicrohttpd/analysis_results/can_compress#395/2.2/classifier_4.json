Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of can_compress:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncan_compress (struct MHD_Connection *con)\n{\n  const char *ae;\n  const char *de;\n\n  ae = MHD_lookup_connection_value (con,\n                                    MHD_HEADER_KIND,\n                                    MHD_HTTP_HEADER_ACCEPT_ENCODING);\n  if (NULL == ae)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  if (0 == strcmp (ae,\n                   \"*\"))\n    return MHD_YES;\n  de = strstr (ae,\n               \"deflate\");\n  if (NULL == de)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  if (((de == ae) ||\n       (de[-1] == ',') ||\n       (de[-1] == ' ')) &&\n      ((de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == '\\0') ||\n       (de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == ',') ||\n       (de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == ';')))\n    return MHD_YES;\n  return MHD_NO;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nde = strstr (ae,\n               \"deflate\");\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
