  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter 'con' itself. The function only reads from 'con' (passes it to MHD_lookup_connection_value) and assigns local pointers 'ae' and 'de'. There are no assignments to 'con', no increments/decrements of it, no rebindings (e.g. con = ...), and the address of 'con' is not taken and passed to other functions. Note that called routines may modify the object pointed to by 'con' (which is permitted by MISRA Rule 17.8), but the pointer parameter variable is not altered in this function, so no fragments require further investigation for Rule 17.8."
