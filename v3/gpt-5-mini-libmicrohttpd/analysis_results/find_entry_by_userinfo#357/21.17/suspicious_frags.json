  "explanation": "This function itself contains no direct calls to any <string.h> functions, but it forwards pointer and size-like members from username_info into other lookup functions. The calls and the exact arguments listed above must be investigated because the called functions (find_entry_by_username, find_entry_by_userhash) may use standard string functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen) and could therefore cause out-of-bounds accesses if the provided pointers or lengths are invalid. Other fragments in the function \u2014 the uname_type comparisons, the function signature, the simple return NULL and the comment \u2014 do not invoke or pass data to any string.h routines and perform only integer/enum checks or simple control flow; they therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this context."
