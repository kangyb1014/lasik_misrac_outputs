  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any <string.h> functions, so it does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However a violation can occur downstream if the computed value (username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2) is used as a byte/length argument to a string/memory function (e.g. memcpy, memcmp, strlen) and that length exceeds the actual size of the buffer pointed to by userhash_bin. Example violation scenario: userhash_hex_len == 10 (so /2 == 5) but userhash_bin points to a buffer of only 4 bytes \u2014 a subsequent memcpy(userhash_bin, src, username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2) would access beyond the buffer bounds."
