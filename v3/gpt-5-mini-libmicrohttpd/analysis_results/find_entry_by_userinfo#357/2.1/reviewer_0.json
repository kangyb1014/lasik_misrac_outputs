That makes the subsequent equality branch for USERHASH and the final return NULL unreachable.

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The first if uses a lower-bound test: MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type. For any uname_type value that is >= MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD that test will succeed, which includes MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH when USERHASH >= STANDARD (the common ordering STANDARD == 0, USERHASH == 1). Thus the equality branch for USERHASH and the final return NULL cannot be reached at runtime, so the code contains unreachable code. That is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. (If, contrary to the usual definitions, USERHASH were less than STANDARD or other invariants exist that allow reaching the later branches, then the branches might be reachable \u2014 but given the scenario described and the usual enum ordering, the report is correct.)"
