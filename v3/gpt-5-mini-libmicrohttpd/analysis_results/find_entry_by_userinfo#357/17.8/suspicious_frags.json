  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is declared as a pointer to const: \"const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info\". The code only reads fields from username_info (comparisons and passing field values to other functions) and does not modify the pointer itself (no assignments to username_info, no increments/decrements, no reassignments). Accesses like username_info->uname_type, username_info->username, username_info->algo3, username_info->userhash_bin, and username_info->userhash_hex_len are read-only in this function. Passing these members as arguments to other functions does not constitute modifying the parameter pointer here. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or even potentially violate the rule within this function."
