Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of find_entry_by_userinfo:\n```c\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final `return NULL;` is not dead code. It is reached when username_info->uname_type does not satisfy either preceding condition (for example if uname_type has a value less than MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD and not equal to MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH, or for malformed/unknown enum values). Removing this return would change program behaviour (could lead to missing return from a non-void function / undefined behaviour), so the operation is not dead."
