  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the controlling expression compares a compile-time constant to username_info->uname_type, which is a runtime value (dependent on the passed-in structure) so the condition is not invariant. (It would only violate the rule if uname_type were provably constant for all calls \u2014 e.g. if it were a compile-time constant or otherwise guaranteed not to vary \u2014 which is not the case here.)"
