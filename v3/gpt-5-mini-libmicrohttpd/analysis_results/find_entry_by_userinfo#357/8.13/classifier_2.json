  "scenario": "If struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo declares username as a non-const pointer (e.g. 'char *username') and/or find_entry_by_username accepts a non-const pointer (e.g. 'char *'), then this call is a violation: a pointer extracted from a const-qualified struct should itself point to a const-qualified type (const char *) so that the constness of the containing object is preserved. In that situation Rule 8.13 is violated. (If, however, username is already declared as 'const char *' and the callee accepts 'const char *', there is no violation.)"
