  "explanation": "The only function calls in this fragment are to find_entry_by_username and find_entry_by_userhash; these are the only places where indirect recursion back to find_entry_by_userinfo could occur and thus must be investigated for Rule 17.2. Other parts of the function (the uname_type checks, the final \"return NULL\" and the function signature) contain no function calls, no function-pointer invocations, no macros expanding to calls, and no other constructs that could introduce direct or indirect self-calls, so they do not need further investigation for this rule."
