  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_increment_response_rc:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_increment_response_rc (struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n  (response->reference_count)++;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call to MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&response->mutex) is not dead in a normal multithreaded build: it performs locking and affects program behaviour (concurrency/synchronization), so its removal would change behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated for this fragment in the intended threaded configuration. A possible violation scenario would be if MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ is defined as a no-op (e.g. a macro or inline function that expands to ((void)0) or otherwise has no side effects) in all translation units where this call is compiled; in that case the call would be executed but its removal would not change program behaviour and would constitute dead code."
