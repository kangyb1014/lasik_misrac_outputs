  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain no function calls or indirect invocation mechanisms: the reference count update is a simple increment expression (not a function call), and the preprocessor conditionals only control whether the mutex calls are compiled. There are no function-pointer dereferences, callbacks, or other calls inside this fragment besides the two explicit mutex-related calls already listed, so the only potential for direct or indirect self-calls in this snippet is via those mutex functions (which have been included in the suspicious list)."
