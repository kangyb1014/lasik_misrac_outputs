  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, switch, while, for, do-while) are present in the provided function body. The only conditional-looking tokens are preprocessor directives (#if defined(...)) which are evaluated at compile time and are not run\u2011time controlling expressions covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3. The increment statement (response->reference_count)++ is not a controlling expression. The calls to MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ and MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ are function/macro invocations, not controlling constructs in this fragment; if those macros/functions contain loops with invariant controlling expressions that would be a separate issue, but that code is not part of the supplied fragment and therefore cannot be flagged here. For these reasons there are no code fragments in the supplied function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
