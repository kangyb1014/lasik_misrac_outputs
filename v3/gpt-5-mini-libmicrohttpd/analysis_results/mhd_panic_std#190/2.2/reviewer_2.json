  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements like '(void) reason;' in the !HAVE_MESSAGES branch are executed expression-statements that have no side effects and exist only to suppress unused-parameter compiler warnings. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, dead code is any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Removing those (void) casts would not change the program's observable behaviour (the function still calls abort()), so they meet the definition of dead code and therefore violate Rule 2.2. (If the project intends to keep them to silence diagnostics, a documented deviation or a different technique such as removing parameter names in the prototype or using a sanctioned UNUSED macro should be used.)"
