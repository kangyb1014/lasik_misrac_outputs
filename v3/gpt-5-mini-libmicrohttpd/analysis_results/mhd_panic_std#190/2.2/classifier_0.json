Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_panic_std:\n```c\n_MHD_NORETURN static void\nmhd_panic_std (void *cls,\n               const char *file,\n               unsigned int line,\n               const char *reason)\n{\n  (void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  fprintf (stderr,\n           _ (\"Fatal error in GNU libmicrohttpd %s:%u: %s\\n\"),\n           file,\n           line,\n           reason);\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The expression statement '(void) cls;' is a no-op executed only to suppress an unused-parameter warning. It has no side effects and removing it does not alter program behaviour (the function still calls abort()). Therefore this statement is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
