It has no side effects and removing it does not alter program behaviour (the function still calls abort()).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The statement '(void) cls;' is the common, intentional idiom to mark a function parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although the cast has no runtime side effects and removing it would not change program behaviour, MISRA's intent in Rule 2.2 is to eliminate truly obsolete code that is no longer needed; idioms that document/explicitly indicate an unused parameter are acceptable practice. In this function the other parameters are conditionally used depending on HAVE_MESSAGES, so the explicit (void) casts silence warnings in the alternative configuration. In short, this is a deliberate no-op used to document/quiet an unused parameter, not unintended dead code, so the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is not correct."
