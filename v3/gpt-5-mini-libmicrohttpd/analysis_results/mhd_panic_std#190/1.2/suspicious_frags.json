  "explanation": "Other code constructs in the snippet are standard C or ordinary macros and do not on their face represent compiler language extensions: the (void) casts are a standard idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings; fprintf and abort are standard C library functions; the use of the _() macro is typically a regular macro/function (e.g. gettext) and is not a compiler language extension; preprocessor conditional (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES / #else / #endif) is standard preprocessor usage; the function parameter and type declarations (void *, const char *, unsigned int) are standard C. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2."
