  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in fill_v1_v2_form that modify any of the function parameters (cls, mime, session, connection) or the pointer variables themselves. Details:\n- (void) cls; \u2014 explicitly marks cls unused; it does not modify the parameter.\n- slen calculation uses session->value_1 and session->value_2 but only reads the objects pointed to; reading the pointees is permitted and the session pointer itself is not assigned to or altered.\n- reply allocation, snprintf, and the (void *)reply cast operate on a local variable (reply), not on any function parameter.\n- Calls to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback, add_session_cookie, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, and MHD_destroy_response pass parameters but do not reassign the function\u2019s parameter variables within this function. (Any modifications those callees make to objects pointed to by pointer parameters are allowed by the rule; modifying the parameter pointer itself would be a violation, and no such operations occur here.)\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
