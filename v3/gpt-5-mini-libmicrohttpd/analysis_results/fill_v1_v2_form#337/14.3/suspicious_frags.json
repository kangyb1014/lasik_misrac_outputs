  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains only conditional statements whose conditions depend on runtime values:\n- if (NULL == reply) \u2014 depends on the result of malloc\n- if (NULL == response) \u2014 depends on MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback\n- if (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(...)) \u2014 depends on the return of a function call\nThere are no loops (while, for, do-while) or switch statements with constant or literal controlling expressions. The allowed exceptions for Rule 14.3 (infinite loops or the specific do-while case) do not apply here. Therefore no code fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3 in this function."
