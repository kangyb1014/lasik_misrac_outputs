  "explanation": "Only the explicit cast-to-void expression is an operation executed with no effect on program behaviour; it exists solely to suppress a compiler warning and its removal would not change runtime behaviour. All other statements produce observable effects or are required for correct resource management and control flow and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: - Memory allocation (reply = malloc(...)) and the subsequent free(reply) on error affect resource usage and program correctness. - snprintf writes the response buffer; removing it would change program output. - MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response all interact with the HTTP response subsystem; their removal would change program behaviour. - add_session_cookie has side effects on the session/response and must be kept. - fprintf emits an observable diagnostic output on error conditions. There is no unreachable code in the fragment (no code after unconditional returns other than intended control flow). Therefore no other code fragments need investigation for dead-code concerns."
