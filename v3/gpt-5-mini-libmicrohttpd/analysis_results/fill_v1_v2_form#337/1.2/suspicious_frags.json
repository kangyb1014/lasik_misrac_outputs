  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/other-compiler extension tokens or builtins such as __attribute__, __extension__, __typeof__, __asm__, __inline__ (non-standard form), __builtin_*, or labels-as-values (&&label).\n- There are no statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no nested functions, and no use of inline assembly.\n- No nonstandard integer types or compiler-specific pragmas are present.\n- The casts (void *)reply and the use of &free to pass a function pointer are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n- All control-flow and declarations use standard C syntax (static function, enum type, pointer parameters, standard library calls: malloc, snprintf, strlen, free).\n\nTherefore nothing in this fragment meets the criterion \u201cexplicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\u201d If you want, I can re-check if any referenced macros/externals (e.g., SECOND_PAGE or the MHD_* APIs) are implemented using compiler extensions elsewhere in the project; those would need to be inspected in their definitions."
