  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function has a single parameter, 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', and this parameter is not modified in the function body: it is only used as an argument to MHD_queue_response (which may use the object pointed to, but that is permitted by the rule). There are no assignments to 'connection', no pointer arithmetic, and no operations that change the value of the parameter. Other identifiers (cached_directory_response, mutex, ret) are either globals or locals and are not function parameters, so they are outside the scope of Rule 17.8 for this function."
