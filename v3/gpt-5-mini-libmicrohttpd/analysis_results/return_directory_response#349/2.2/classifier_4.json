  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of return_directory_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  (void) pthread_mutex_lock (&mutex);\n  if (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n                              internal_error_response);\n  else\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n  (void) pthread_mutex_unlock (&mutex);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated based on the fragment alone. The snippet is a static function declaration (with body shown elsewhere) \u2014 by itself there is no evidence that it is executed yet has no effect. Whether Rule 2.2 is violated is a project-wide property and cannot be decided from this fragment alone. Practical notes: if the function is never called anywhere in the project it is simply unreachable (note 2 of the rule) and not classified as dead code by Rule 2.2; a true violation would occur only if the function is executed at runtime but its removal would not affect observable program behaviour (for example, if all calls to MHD_queue_response are no-ops and locking/unlocking have no observable effect), in which case the function\u2019s operations would constitute dead code."
