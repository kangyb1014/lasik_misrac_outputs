  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of return_directory_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  (void) pthread_mutex_lock (&mutex);\n  if (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n                              internal_error_response);\n  else\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n  (void) pthread_mutex_unlock (&mutex);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 from the fragment alone you cannot say this is dead code. The if-test selects between two responses at runtime, so Rule 2.2 is not violated based on the shown code. A concrete violation scenario would be if, by program invariant, cached_directory_response is always non-NULL and the two branches always produce identical observable behaviour (for example cached_directory_response is the same object as internal_error_response or MHD_queue_response behaves identically for both calls). In that case the conditional (and one branch) would be executed but removable without changing program behaviour, which would violate Rule 2.2."
