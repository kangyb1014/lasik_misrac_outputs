Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of return_directory_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  (void) pthread_mutex_lock (&mutex);\n  if (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n                              internal_error_response);\n  else\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n  (void) pthread_mutex_unlock (&mutex);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nelse\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the else branch is an active alternative path (executed when cached_directory_response != NULL) and performs a distinct operation (queues a different response). Removing it would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (A hypothetical violation would be if both branches performed identical side-effect-free operations or the else branch executed but its removal did not change observable behaviour\u2014for example both branches queuing the same response or the else branch only containing code with no effect on program behaviour.)"
