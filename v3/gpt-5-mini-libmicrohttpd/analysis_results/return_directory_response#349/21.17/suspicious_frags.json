  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The function only locks/unlocks a mutex, checks a pointer for NULL, and calls MHD_queue_response with response objects; it does not perform any buffer or string manipulations itself or pass raw character buffers to string-handling routines. Therefore there are no code fragments here that directly risk out-of-bounds accesses covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If the implementations of MHD_queue_response or the response objects manipulate strings, those implementations would need separate review, but they are outside the scope of this function and not present in the provided code.)"
