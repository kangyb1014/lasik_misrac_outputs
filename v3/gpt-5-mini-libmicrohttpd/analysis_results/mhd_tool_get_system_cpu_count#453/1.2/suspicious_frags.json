  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: a normal function definition, local variable declarations, standard if/return statements, comments, and preprocessor conditionals. The preprocessor checks (e.g. defined(__linux__), defined(__GLIBC__)) rely on predefined macros and are not language extensions themselves. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, inline asm, nested functions, compiler builtins (e.g. __builtin_*), or other vendor-specific syntax. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
