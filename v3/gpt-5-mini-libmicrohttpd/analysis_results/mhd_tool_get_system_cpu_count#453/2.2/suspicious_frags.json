  "explanation": "I did not flag the simple early-return checks that immediately return a positive res after calling a specialised API or sysctl (the first two blocks) because those assignments and conditional returns clearly affect control flow and return value: removing them would change program behaviour. The final return -1 is the defined fallback and cannot be removed. There are no obvious unreachable-code sequences in the function (no code after an unconditional return within the same compilation branch), and initializations are not present that would qualify as dead under Rule 2.2. The remaining assignments to res before each distinct detection attempt are used by the subsequent conditionals, so they are not candidates for dead-code removal. The flagged fragments are the parts most likely to contain operations that are executed yet potentially redundant (e.g. the Linux-specific >2 checks and the proc_cpu_count check and call), and therefore should be investigated to determine whether their execution is necessary or can be removed without changing behaviour."
