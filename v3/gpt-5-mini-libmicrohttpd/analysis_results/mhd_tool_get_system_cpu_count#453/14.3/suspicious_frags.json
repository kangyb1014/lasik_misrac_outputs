  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are manifestly invariant and thus none that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale:\n\n- All C selection statements (if) use variables (res, proc_cpu_count) on the right-hand side of the comparisons (e.g. if (0 < res), if (2 < res), if (proc_cpu_count == res)). These are evaluated at run time and are not compile-time constant/invariant expressions.\n\n- There are no iteration statements (for, while, do-while) with constant controlling expressions in the function. The code does not create infinite loops using a constant true, nor a do-while with an integer constant false \u2014 the rule exceptions therefore do not need to be applied.\n\n- The #if / #else / #endif directives are preprocessor conditions evaluated at translation phase and are not C-language controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. Even if those macros produce different compiled branches, the C controlling expressions inside each branch remain non-invariant as noted above.\n\n- No switch statements or other control constructs with compile-time constant controlling expressions are present.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 14.3 or require further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
