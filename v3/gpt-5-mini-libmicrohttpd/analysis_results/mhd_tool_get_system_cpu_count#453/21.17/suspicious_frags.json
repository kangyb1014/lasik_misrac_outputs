  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function because it contains no uses of the string handling functions from <string.h> (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function performs only integer assignments, comparisons, conditional returns, and calls to helper functions; there is no buffer manipulation, pointer arithmetic, or array indexing that would suggest a potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds access via string.h routines.\n\nNotes on what to inspect elsewhere (not included as suspicious fragments here):\n- The helper functions called from this function may themselves use string.h APIs; their implementations should be reviewed for Rule 21.17 compliance. These functions are:\n  - mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_\n  - mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_\n  - mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_\n  - mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count\n  - mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_\n  - mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_\n\nRationale: Since Rule 21.17 concerns the use of string.h functions, only code that actually invokes those functions (directly or in called helpers) can violate the rule. This function contains none of those invocations; therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17. Investigations should focus on the implementations of the listed helper functions if they use string handling APIs."
