  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the for-loop and the variables used as counters/indices need investigation with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2. The rest of the function consists of value checks, assertions, memcmp calls and return statements that do not affect the well-formedness of the for statement (they do not change the loop counter or the for-clause expressions). The declaration/initialization and increment of the separate integer counter (i) and the pre-loop increment of param->num_headers are included above because they interact with the loop logic and may indicate more than one counter or counters modified in the loop body \u2014 these are the relevant elements to inspect for compliance. Other lines (memcmp checks, mhd_assert calls, key/value size checks, the pointer traversals inside the loop body aside from the loop header, and the return statements) do not introduce additional loop counters or modify the for-clause expressions, and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.2."
