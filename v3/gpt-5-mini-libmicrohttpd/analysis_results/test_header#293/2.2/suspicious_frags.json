  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed are considered not suspicious for dead-code under Rule 2.2 because they are either simple declarations, loop control, or clearly affect observable behaviour and cannot be removed without changing program semantics. Specifically: - The declarations (param, connection, pos, i) are required for the function and used. - The for loop header and traversal (for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)) is the core iteration over data and is reachable and necessary. - The initialization i = 0; and the increment ++i within the comparison are used to select the nth header and thus influence control flow. - The final return MHD_NO after the loop is reachable when no matching header is found and affects behaviour. - The memcmp/size comparisons and returns inside the matched-branch are plausible checks whose removal would change correctness. The fragments selected above are flagged because they are places where operations may be redundant, compiled out (e.g. assertion macros), or whose control-flow/side-effects (pre-increment vs stored param modification) make it plausible that removal would not change observable behaviour in some build configurations; they therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
