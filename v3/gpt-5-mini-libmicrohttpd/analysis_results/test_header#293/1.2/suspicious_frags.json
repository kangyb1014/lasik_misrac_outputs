  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: enums, structs, pointer casts from void*, standard library functions (memcmp), size_t, ordinary control flow (for, if, continue, return), and identifiers/macros that look project-specific (mhd_assert, MHD_YES/MHD_NO) but are not language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly (__asm__), labels-as-values, asm goto, nonstandard calling conventions, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other documented compiler-only features. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 1.2 in this code."
