  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions need not be investigated for Rule 14.3 because they are not invariant: the for-loop condition (NULL != pos) depends on pos which is updated by pos = pos->next; the condition if (kind != pos->kind) depends on pos; the test if (++i == param->num_headers) depends on ++i which changes each iteration; the comparisons against pos->header_size and pos->value_size depend on the current node (pos) which changes; the memcmp() results depend on the pointed-to buffer contents; and the mhd_assert checks involving pos->header and pos->value depend on pos. There are no do-while or intentional infinite-loop exceptions applicable in this function."
