  "explanation": "I selected all conditional-preprocessor and runtime-conditional fragments that can affect reachability: each #if / #endif block and the final if (newline_needed) printf are the places where code may be excluded at compile-time or never executed at run-time. Other parts of the function are not reported because they are ordinary, reachable constructs or simple declarations that do not themselves create unreachable code: the function signature and opening/closing braces, the local variable declaration and initialization (int newline_needed = 0;), and the use of newline_needed as a variable are standard and do not by themselves constitute unreachable statements. No other standalone statements in the function create obvious compile-time or run-time unreachability beyond the conditional blocks listed above."
