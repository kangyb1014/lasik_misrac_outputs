  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The #if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 conditional controls whether this whole fragment is compiled. When the condition is true the code contains a runtime test (MHD_is_feature_supported) and thus the statements are reachable at run time. When the preprocessor condition is false the fragment is simply excluded from compilation (not \"unreachable\" code within the translation unit that is compiled). Therefore, as written this fragment does not introduce unreachable code. (A violation could only occur if, for the project\u2019s chosen build configuration, MHD_VERSION is permanently below 0x00097701 so the block is never compiled in any build \u2014 that would be a build/configuration issue rather than unreachable code within a compiled translation unit.)"
