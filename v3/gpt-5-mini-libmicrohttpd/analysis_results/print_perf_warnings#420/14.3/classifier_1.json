  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the controlling expression is the variable 'newline_needed', which is modified in the preceding code under various compile-time conditions, so it is not inherently invariant. However, a violation can occur in a specific build configuration: if none of the #if blocks (and the MHD runtime check) ever set newline_needed (i.e. all those conditions are false and newline_needed remains initialized to 0), then the condition 'if (newline_needed)' is effectively invariant (always false) in that translation unit \u2014 that situation would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
