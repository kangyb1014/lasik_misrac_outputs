Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I did not mark the fprintf calls (outside the fragments listed) or the preprocessor condition lines themselves as suspicious because they have observable effects (writing to stderr) or are compile-time controlled (may be omitted entirely depending on build). The call to MHD_is_feature_supported is used in a conditional and thus affects control flow. The variable initialization (int newline_needed = 0;) and the use of newline_needed in the final if() are relevant to program behaviour (they determine whether an extra newline is printed). Therefore these other operations are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2 and do not need to be investigated further here."
