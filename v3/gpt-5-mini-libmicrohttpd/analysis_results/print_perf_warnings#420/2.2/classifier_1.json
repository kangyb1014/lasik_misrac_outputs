  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of print_perf_warnings:\n```c\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fprintf call is conditionally compiled and executed only when __GNUC__ and __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__ are defined. Its removal would change program behaviour (the warning would not be printed), so it is not dead code. (Note: the branch does not update newline_needed, which may be a logic issue, but that is not a Rule 2.2 dead-code violation.)"
