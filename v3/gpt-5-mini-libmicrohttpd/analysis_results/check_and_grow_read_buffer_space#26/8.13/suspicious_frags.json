  "explanation": "No local pointer declarations appear in this function that could be changed to point to const-qualified types. The only pointer in this fragment is the function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c'. This pointer is used to modify members of the structure (for example, c->event_loop_info is assigned and other fields are read/written), so it cannot be made a pointer to const. There are no other pointer variables (no char*, void*, or other pointer declarations) in the shown code that could be const-qualified. Calls that pass pointers (e.g. try_grow_read_buffer(c, ...), has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer(c)) use the same non-const connection pointer; whether those functions could accept a pointer-to-const is not visible from this fragment, but within this function the connection object is mutated, so changing the parameter here to const would be incorrect. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
