True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nViolation: the mhd_assert(0) in the default branch uses a constant controlling expression. The assert macro typically expands to a selection (e.g. if(!(expr)) ... or (expr) ? (void)0 : __assert()), so with expr == 0 the controlling expression is invariant (constant). This constitutes a Rule 14.3 violation (invariant controlling expression).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the normal/typical case. Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions. The mhd_assert(0) call will usually expand to a conditional selection (for example: (expr) ? (void)0 : __assert_fail(...) or if (!(expr)) __assert_fail(...)). In that expansion the controlling expression becomes the constant 0 (invariant), which violates Rule 14.3. \n\nThat said, whether a violation actually exists in this specific translation unit depends on the definition of the mhd_assert macro. If mhd_assert is implemented so that it does not introduce a conditional/selection using the supplied expression as a controlling expression (for example, it converts its argument to a value passed to a function or is completely compiled out without a conditional), then there is no invariant controlling expression and no 14.3 violation. However, given typical assert-like macro implementations, the agent\u2019s report is correct."
