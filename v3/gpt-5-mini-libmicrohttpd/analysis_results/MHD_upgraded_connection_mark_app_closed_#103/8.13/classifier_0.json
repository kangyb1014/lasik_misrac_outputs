  "scenario": "Not violated: the code writes to members of the pointed-to object (e.g. daemon->resuming = true), so the pointer must refer to a non-const MHD_Daemon. A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for read-only access \u2014 in that case it should be declared as pointing to const (e.g. const struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon)."
