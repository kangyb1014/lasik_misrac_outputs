  "scenario": "Cannot determine a definite violation from this fragment alone. The expression MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_(daemon->itc) merely passes the member daemon->itc to a macro/function. If daemon->itc has type 'struct MHD_ITC *' and the macro only reads the pointed object (does not modify it), then the pointer should be a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_ITC *') and that would be a violation of Rule 8.13 as currently declared. If, however, the ITC object or its pointer can be modified by the macro/function or elsewhere, then a non-const pointer is appropriate and there is no violation. The fragment alone does not prove a Rule 8.13 violation."
