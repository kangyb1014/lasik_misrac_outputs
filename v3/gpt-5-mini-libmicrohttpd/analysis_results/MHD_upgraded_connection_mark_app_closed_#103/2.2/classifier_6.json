  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  /* Cache 'daemon' here to avoid data races */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->urh);\n  mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME));\n\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  connection->urh->was_closed = true;\n  connection->resuming = true;\n  daemon->resuming = true;\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  if ( (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) &&\n       (!

  "scenario": "Based on the single fragment, this assignment is not provably dead: it sets a daemon-wide resuming flag that is plausibly read elsewhere to influence behaviour (so removing it could change program behaviour). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not shown to be violated from this fragment alone. If, however, across the whole project daemon->resuming is never read (the flag is written only and never inspected), then this operation would be dead code \u2014 removing the assignment would not affect behaviour, which would violate Rule 2.2."
