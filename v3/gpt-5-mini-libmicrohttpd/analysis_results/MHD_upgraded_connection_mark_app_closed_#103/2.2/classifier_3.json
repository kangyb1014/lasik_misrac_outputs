Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  /* Cache 'daemon' here to avoid data races */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->urh);\n  mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME));\n\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  connection->urh->was_closed = true;\n  connection->resuming = true;\n  daemon->resuming = true;\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  if ( (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) &&\n       (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is a conditional assertion compiled only when MHD_USE_THREADS is defined: mhd_assert(NULL == daemon->worker_pool);. As written this is not dead code because it can execute and may change program behaviour (e.g. trigger an assertion failure/abort) so removing it could affect behaviour. If MHD_USE_THREADS is not defined the code is simply not present (not unreachable dead code). Note: if in the actual build mhd_assert always expands to a no-op (e.g. fully disabled in all configurations), then the assertion would be dead and could violate Rule 2.2, but that is not shown in the fragment."
