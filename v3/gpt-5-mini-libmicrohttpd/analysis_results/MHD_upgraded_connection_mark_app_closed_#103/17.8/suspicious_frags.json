  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter variable 'connection' itself. The code only reads 'connection' and modifies objects it points to (e.g. connection->urh->was_closed and connection->resuming), which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The local variable 'daemon' is initialized from connection->daemon and declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *const', so the pointer cached in 'daemon' is not reassigned. Calls to MHD_mutex_* and MHD_itc_activate_ operate on members obtained from 'daemon' or other objects; assertion macros only check values. Therefore there are no fragments that violate the prohibition on modifying a function parameter (reassigning the pointer itself)."
