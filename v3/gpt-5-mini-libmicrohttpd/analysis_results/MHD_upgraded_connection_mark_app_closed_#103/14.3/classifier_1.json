  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the expression 0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME) depends on the run-time field daemon->options and therefore is not an invariant. Even if mhd_assert expands to a controlling if/branch, the controlling expression is not compile-time invariant. (A violation would occur if the expression were actually constant at compile time \u2014 e.g. if daemon->options were a compile-time constant or MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME were defined so the result is always true/false.)"
