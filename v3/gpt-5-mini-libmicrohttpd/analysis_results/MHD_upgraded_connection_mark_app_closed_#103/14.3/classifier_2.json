  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment uses a preprocessor conditional (#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)) and an assertion macro call. MISRA Rule 14.3 applies to the controlling expressions of C selection/iteration statements (if/while/for/do/switch). The preprocessor directive is not a C controlling expression, and the mhd_assert call is not itself a language-level controlling expression in this fragment. Furthermore, the asserted expression (NULL == daemon->worker_pool) is not a compile-time invariant (it depends on a run-time object member), so it would not violate the rule even if the macro expanded to a conditional check. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated here."
