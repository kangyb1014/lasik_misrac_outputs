  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Rationale: \n- Every assignment to sys_cpu_count is followed by use of that value (condition checks, printf and return). Removing any of those assignments would change the returned core count or the printed messages. \n- proc_cpu_count is assigned from mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count() and then tested and used to set sys_cpu_count when appropriate; it is not unused. \n- All calls that produce side effects (mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count, fprintf, printf) affect observable behaviour (return value, diagnostic output and timing) so their removal would change program behaviour. \n- The #ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT block is conditionally compiled; when present it performs a guarded assignment that can affect sys_cpu_count and therefore the function result \u2014 it is not dead. \n- There is no unreachable code (every branch can be reached depending on return values), no unused variables, and no assignments whose results are never used. \nBecause none of the operations meet the definition \u201cexecuted but removable without affecting program behaviour\u201d, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 2.2."
