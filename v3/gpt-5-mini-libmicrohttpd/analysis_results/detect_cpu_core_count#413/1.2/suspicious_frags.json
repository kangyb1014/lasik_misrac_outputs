  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the shown code. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function, int/unsigned int types, standard library calls (fprintf, printf), preprocessor conditional (#ifdef), string literal concatenation, and the conditional (?:) operator. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ...; }) used as an expression, nested functions, GCC/Clang builtins, Microsoft-specific keywords, or inline assembler. The local declaration inside the if-block is a standard C99/C11 feature (not a compiler extension). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
