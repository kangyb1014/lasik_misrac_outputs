  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 concerns modifying a function parameter (or the pointer value passed as a parameter). The function detect_cpu_core_count has no parameters. All assignments in the function (to sys_cpu_count and proc_cpu_count) affect local variables, not parameters. The use of the macro MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT (if defined) assigns a value to a local variable, and the printf/fprintf calls do not modify this function's parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
