  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if controlling expression depends on the runtime value of 'flags' (obtained from fcntl(F_GETFL)) and on the runtime result of the fcntl(F_SETFL) call. It is not a compile-time or invariant controlling expression, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not violated. (Only a hypothetical pathological case such as O_NONBLOCK being defined as 0 would make the left operand always false, but that is not the actual code intent and would be a problem in the macro definition rather than this conditional.)"
