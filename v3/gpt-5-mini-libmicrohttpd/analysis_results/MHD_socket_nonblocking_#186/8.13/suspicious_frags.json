  "explanation": "Only one pointer usage appears in this function: taking the address of the local variable 'flags' and passing it to ioctlsocket. That creates a pointer to a non-const unsigned long and should be inspected to determine whether the callee modifies the value or whether a const-qualified pointer could be used. No other pointer declarations or pointer arguments exist in the snippet: fcntl calls pass integers by value (no pointer), the function parameter 'MHD_socket sock' is not shown as a pointer in this code, and there are no other uses of the address-of operator or pointer variables. Therefore no other fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
