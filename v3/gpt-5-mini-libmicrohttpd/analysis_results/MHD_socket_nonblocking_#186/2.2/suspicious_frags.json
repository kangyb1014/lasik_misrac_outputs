  "explanation": "No code fragments warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code). Reasoning by fragment:\n\n- Preprocessor branches (#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS) / #elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)): only one branch is compiled, so there is no unreachable-in-compiled-image code within this translation unit. The unused branch is removed at preprocessing time, not executed; unreachable code (per note 2) is not considered dead code by the rule.\n\n- POSIX branch:\n  - flags is declared and immediately assigned the result of fcntl(sock, F_GETFL). That value is subsequently tested and used (returned-on-error or used in bit tests and possibly passed to fcntl(F_SETFL)). Removing the assignment or the variable would change program behaviour, so it is not dead.\n  - The early return on (-1 == flags) prevents further action on error; this is executed-only-on-error and its removal would change behaviour, so it is not dead.\n  - The compound conditional ((flags | O_NONBLOCK) != flags) && (0 != fcntl(...)) uses short-circuit semantics. The second operand (fcntl(F_SETFL,...)) is only executed if the first indicates O_NONBLOCK is not already set. This is intentional control flow; the guarded fcntl is not dead because it may be required to change socket flags.\n\n- Winsock branch:\n  - unsigned long flags = 1; is an initialization used as an argument to ioctlsocket(&flags). That initialization is not dead (per note 3 initializations are not candidates for dead code) and the value is consumed by ioctlsocket.\n  - The cast (int) FIONBIO and the call to ioctlsocket are active operations whose removal would change behaviour.\n\n- Final return: return ! 0; evaluates to 1 and signals success. Although the expression style is unusual, it is executed and affects the function\u2019s return value; it is not dead.\n\nNo expression or statement in the compiled code is executed solely for no effect. There are no assignments whose results are unused, no function calls whose side-effects are ignored and removable without changing behaviour, nor any executed statements that do not influence state or observable behaviour. Therefore there are no code fragments that meet the MISRA definition of dead code in this function."
