  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function. There is no call to the standard library function memcmp, nor any other obvious memory-compare or string-compare routine (e.g. strcmp, strncmp) that could be used to compare null-terminated strings. The code only uses system calls and bitwise/assignment operations (fcntl, ioctlsocket, flag manipulation). The comparisons present are numeric/bitwise checks, not string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
