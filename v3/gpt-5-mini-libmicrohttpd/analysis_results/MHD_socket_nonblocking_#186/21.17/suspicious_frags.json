  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) that might access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The provided function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions and does not perform any buffer or string operations. The operations are limited to calls to fcntl and ioctlsocket and simple scalar variables (flags, sock). The only pointer used is &flags passed to ioctlsocket, which is not a <string.h> routine and does not involve array/string bounds. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that are relevant to Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be investigated under that rule."
