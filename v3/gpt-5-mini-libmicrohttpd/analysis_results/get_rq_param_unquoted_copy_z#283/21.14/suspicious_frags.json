  "explanation": "No call to memcmp appears in this function. The only standard-library function used is memcpy (a copy operation, not a comparison) and a call to MHD_str_unquote (an internal routine whose implementation is outside this snippet). The code also performs explicit length-based operations and explicitly NUL-terminates the buffer, so there is no evidence here of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If desired, inspect the implementation of MHD_str_unquote in other code to ensure it does not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.)"
