  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nget_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param, char *buf)\n{\n  size_t len;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  if (! param->quoted)\n  {\n    memcpy (buf, param->value.str, param->value.len);\n    buf [param->value.len] = 0;\n    return param->value.len;\n  }\n\n  len = MHD_str_unquote (param->value.str, param->value.len, buf);\n  mhd_assert (0 != len);\n  mhd_assert (len < param->value.len);\n  buf[len] = 0;\n  return len;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nbuf [param->value.len] = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment buf[param->value.len] = 0; is executed in the branch where param->quoted is false, immediately after copying param->value.len bytes into buf. It writes the terminating NUL character to produce a C string (the function name and later code expect a NUL-terminated copy). Removing this store would change program behaviour (the buffer would no longer be NUL-terminated), so it is not dead code."
