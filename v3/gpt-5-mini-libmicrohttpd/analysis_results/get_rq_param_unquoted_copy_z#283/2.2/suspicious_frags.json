Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (function signature/definition, the local variable declaration, and the surrounding braces/structure) are not included because they are structural and required for the function to compile and to define its behaviour \u2014 they are not executable operations that could be removed without changing program behaviour. The variable declaration (size_t len;) and the function header establish the context needed by the operations listed above, so they are not candidates for dead-code removal and therefore need not be investigated under Rule 2.2."
