  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nget_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param, char *buf)\n{\n  size_t len;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  if (! param->quoted)\n  {\n    memcpy (buf, param->value.str, param->value.len);\n    buf [param->value.len] = 0;\n    return param->value.len;\n  }\n\n  len = MHD_str_unquote (param->value.str, param->value.len, buf);\n  mhd_assert (0 != len);\n  mhd_assert (len < param->value.len);\n  buf[len] = 0;\n  return len;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! param->quoted)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general. The conditional if (!param->quoted) selects necessary behaviour for quoted vs unquoted parameters and is not dead code in the shown context. A violation could only occur in a project-specific situation where the branch is redundant\u2014for example, if every call in the entire project always supplies param->quoted with the same constant value and additionally both branches have identical observable effects (e.g. MHD_str_unquote behaves exactly like the memcpy path for all inputs). In that case the conditional and one branch would be redundant (removal would not change program behaviour) and would violate Rule 2.2."
