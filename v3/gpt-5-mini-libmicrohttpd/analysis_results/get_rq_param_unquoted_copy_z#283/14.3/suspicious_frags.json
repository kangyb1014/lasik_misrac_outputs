  "explanation": "The only controlling expression in this function is the if-condition (! param->quoted) \u2014 this should be investigated for Rule 14.3 (invariant controlling expressions). Other lines are not controlling expressions: mhd_assert(...) calls are macro invocations (not direct if/switch/loop controlling expressions in the source) and their arguments are runtime-dependent, memcpy/assignments/returns and the call to MHD_str_unquote are ordinary statements or function calls, not control constructs. There are no loops, switch statements, or conditional (? :) operators in this function, so no other controlling expressions need investigation for Rule 14.3."
