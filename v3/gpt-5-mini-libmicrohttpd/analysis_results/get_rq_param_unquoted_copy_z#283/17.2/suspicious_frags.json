  "explanation": "I have listed all locations in the function that could participate in direct or indirect recursion: the function definition itself and every function-call-expression present in the body. Other fragments in the function (local variable declaration, pointer/member accesses, buffer indexing/assignments that write the terminating NUL, and the return statements) do not contain function calls and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion. If further investigation is required, reviewers should inspect the implementations of the called routines listed above (and any macros they expand to) to determine whether they call back into this function (directly or via a chain of calls)."
