  "explanation": "The pointers not listed above do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: - const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data are already const-qualified, so they comply with the rule. - The dynamically allocated callback_param is passed to MHD_create_response_from_callback and is presumably owned/modified by the callback/free functions; it cannot generally be made const without changing the API/semantics. - The response object and headers are managed via the library API (MHD_create_response_from_callback, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_destroy_response); these APIs typically expect non-const pointers because they manage/modify the objects. - The static object aptr is intentionally referenced by pointer value in req_cls to detect the first call; that usage pattern is why req_cls manipulation is suspicious (and thus included above). - String literals such as \"chunked\" are already const; their use is appropriate. Therefore only the listed fragments need further investigation for potential missing const qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
