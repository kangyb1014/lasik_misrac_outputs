  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions appear in the provided code fragment. The function only: declares an integer variable (uint64_t utimeout), calls MHD_get_timeout64(daemon, &utimeout) (a non\u2011standard function \u2014 not one of the string.h routines), compares integers (if (INT64_MAX < utimeout)) and performs an integer cast/return. Rule 21.17 specifically targets string handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc. None of these (or any other <string.h> calls) are present here, so there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 21.17. Note: if you want to check for indirect uses of string functions, examine the implementation of MHD_get_timeout64 itself \u2014 that called function is outside the provided fragment and would need separate review, but the current code contains no direct string.h usage to flag."
