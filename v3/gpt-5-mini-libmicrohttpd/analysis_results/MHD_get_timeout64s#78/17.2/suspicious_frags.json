    "_MHD_EXTERN int64_t\nMHD_get_timeout64s (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{",
    "if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &utimeout))"
  ],
  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call in this function (no occurrence of MHD_get_timeout64s being invoked). The only place that could cause indirect recursion is the call to the external function MHD_get_timeout64, so that call is flagged for investigation to determine whether MHD_get_timeout64 might (directly or indirectly) call MHD_get_timeout64s. Other fragments (variable declaration uint64_t utimeout;, the comparison against INT64_MAX, the casts and return statements, and the MHD_NO token used in the conditional) do not perform function calls or use function pointers and therefore cannot by themselves introduce recursion; they need not be further investigated for Rule 17.2 compliance."
