  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 were found. The function has a single pointer parameter (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon) that is never assigned to or otherwise modified inside the function \u2014 it is only passed unchanged to MHD_get_timeout64. The other variable (utimeout) is a local object; its address (&utimeout) is passed to the callee, which is permitted because the rule allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. There are no assignments like \"daemon = ...\" or modifications of any function parameter, so no further fragments need investigation under Rule 17.8."
