  "explanation": "The only pointers in this function that appear to be used only for read access (and therefore candidates for pointing to const-qualified types) are the iteration pointer for response headers and the header/value source pointers used with memcpy. The variable 'pos' is only used to traverse and read header fields (pos->header, pos->value, pos->next) and is never modified, so 'pos' could be declared as a pointer to const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header; likewise the header/value members used as memcpy sources may be const char * in the struct. Other pointer usages in this function should NOT be investigated: - 'connection' (and alias 'c') are used to modify connection state (c->write_buffer_append_offset and other fields), so the pointed-to object cannot be const here. - 'buf' points into the write buffer and is written to (buf[...] = ... and memcpy into buf), so it cannot be const. - The write buffer pointer and offsets are intentionally mutated (connection_maximize_write_buffer, c->write_buffer_append_offset), so those pointers/objects are legitimately non-const. Therefore only the header-iteration/source pointers are plausible Rule 8.13 issues and are reported above."
