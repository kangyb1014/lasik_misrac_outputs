The mhd_assert call has no observable side effects in this context, so its execution does not alter program behaviour; removing it would not change the program\u2019s behaviour. Therefore this assertion is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert call is an explicit runtime invariant check; whether it is \"dead\" depends on the definition and behaviour of the mhd_assert macro and on whether the assertion can ever fail in practice. If mhd_assert can produce observable effects (log, increment counters, abort the program, change timing) then removing it would change program behaviour in at least some runs, so it is not dead code. Even if mhd_assert has no side effects in a particular build, it serves as a defensive diagnostic: removal would change failure-handling behaviour (and possibly timing), so one cannot conclude at the project level that it is dead without knowing the macro and the intended fault semantics. Finally, the assertion is checking an invariant that could detect runtime corruption (integer overflow, unexpected sizes, memory corruption), so it is not automatically redundant just because the surrounding code appears to make the condition true in the normal case. Therefore there is insufficient basis to claim a Rule 2.2 violation from the shown code alone."
