  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of build_connection_chunked_response_footer:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nbuild_connection_chunked_response_footer (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  char *buf;           /**< the buffer to write footers to */\n  size_t buf_size;     /**< the size of the @a buf */\n  size_t used_size;    /**< the used size of the @a buf */\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  mhd_assert (connection->rp.props.chunked);\n  /* TODO: allow combining of the final footer with the last chunk,\n   * modify the next assert. */\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_CHUNKED_BODY_SENT == connection->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rp.response);\n\n  buf_size = connection_maximize_write_buffer (c);\n  /* '5' is the minimal size of chunked footer (\"0\\r\\n\\r\\n\") */\n  if (buf_size < 5)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->write_buffer);\n  buf = c->write_buffer + c->write_buffer_append_offset;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != buf);\n  used_size = 0;\n  buf[used_size++] = '0';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n\n  for (pos = c->rp.response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if (MHD_FOOTER_KIND == pos->kind)\n    {\n      size_t new_used_size; /* resulting size with this header */\n      /* '4' is colon, space, linefeeds */\n      new_used_size = used_size + pos->header_size + pos->value_size + 4;\n      if (new_used_size > buf_size)\n        return MHD_NO;\n      memcpy (buf + used_size, pos->header, pos->header_size);\n      used_size += pos->header_size;\n      buf[used_size++] = ':';\n      buf[used_size++] = ' ';\n      memcpy (buf + used_size, pos->value, pos->value_size);\n      used_size += pos->value_size;\n      buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n      buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n      mhd_assert (used_size == new_used_size);\n    }\n  }\n  if (used_size + 2 > buf_size)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n\n  c->write_buffer_append_offset += used_size;\n  mhd_assert (c->write_buffer_append_offset <= c->write_buffer_size);\n\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the declaration 'struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;' by itself does not breach Rule 14.2. In the for statement that follows, the first clause assigns pos (initialises the loop counter), the second clause only tests pos, and the third clause updates only pos (pos = pos->next). pos is the single loop counter and is not modified inside the loop body, so the for loop is well\u2011formed under Rule 14.2."
