  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a normal function declaration (static enum ...), pointer and const pointer declarations, standard types (size_t, char *), standard library call memcpy, NULL checks and standard for-loop iteration. The /**< ... */ comments are Doxygen-style comments (comments are not language extensions). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm/asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; (expr); }), variable-length array extensions, nonstandard pragmas, or other vendor-specific keywords. The mhd_assert and other identifiers are macro/function calls but their expansions are not present here; nothing in this fragment explicitly uses a documented compiler extension. Therefore no code fragment in this function needs to be flagged for Rule 1.2."
