  "explanation": "I have flagged all conditional and iterative controlling expressions and the two assert expressions because Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions (if, else-if, switch, for/while/do-while and similar). These fragments should be investigated to ensure the controlling expressions are not invariant (or are allowed by the stated exceptions). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: - The individual case labels, simple assignments that populate the daemon_info_dummy_* structures and the return statements are not controlling expressions. - The default: return NULL; and the other case branches that immediately return or assign are not iterative/conditional controlling expressions violating 14.3. - The preprocessor conditional (#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT) is a compile-time selection, not a runtime controlling expression subject to 14.3 (though the runtime switch/case that contains it is already flagged). - Comments, structure field accesses and simple arithmetic/assignments (e.g. daemon->daemon_info_dummy_flags.flags = daemon->options;) are not controlling expressions. - There are no do-while loops or intentional infinite loops in this function (the allowed exceptions listed in the rule do not apply elsewhere). Therefore the listed controlling constructs cover the potential Rule 14.3 issues in this function; the remaining code elements are not relevant to this rule."
