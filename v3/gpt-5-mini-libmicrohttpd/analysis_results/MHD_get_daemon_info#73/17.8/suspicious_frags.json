  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying a function parameter itself (and for pointer parameters, forbids modifying the pointer value), but permits modifying the object the pointer points to. In this function: - The pointer parameter 'daemon' is never reassigned (no statements like 'daemon = ...'), so the pointer itself is not modified. - The non-pointer parameter 'info_type' is not modified. - All assignments target members of the object pointed to by 'daemon' (for example, daemon->daemon_info_dummy_... and daemon->connections). Modifying the pointed-to object's members is allowed by the rule. - The variadic arguments are not used/modified. - Returning addresses of members of *daemon does not modify any parameter. - The mhd_assert and conditional checks only read fields and do not assign to the parameters. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
