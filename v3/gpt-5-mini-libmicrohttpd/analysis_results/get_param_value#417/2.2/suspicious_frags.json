  "explanation": "The remaining fragments of the function are ordinary variable declarations, the final return PERF_RPL_PARAM_STR_PLUS_NEXT, and the function signature; these are necessary for correct control flow and observable behaviour and do not present obvious candidates for dead code. The use of the 'digits' variable in the validation expression and the ordering of the logical OR rely on short-circuit evaluation to avoid dereferencing NULL; that behavior is purposeful and not dead. No other obvious unreachable branches or redundant assignments appear outside the listed fragments. The listed fragments are those where behaviour could be redundant or provably invariant depending on caller contracts (e.g. whether param_tail or next_param can be NUL/NULL or whether param_tail can begin with '='), so they require investigation to determine if any executed operations are in fact removable without affecting program behaviour."
