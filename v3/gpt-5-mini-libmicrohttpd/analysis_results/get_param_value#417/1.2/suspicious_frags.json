  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: a static function, an enum return type, pointer arithmetic, array indexing, standard types (size_t), NULL, standard operators and control flow (if/else/return), and a call to fprintf and an external helper mhd_tool_str_to_uint. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, label-as-value (&label), GCC/Clang builtins (__builtin_*), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions)."
