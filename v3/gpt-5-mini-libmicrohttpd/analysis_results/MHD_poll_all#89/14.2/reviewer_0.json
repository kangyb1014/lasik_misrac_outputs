First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop uses a separate variable (urhn) in the third clause: for (urh = daemon->urh_tail; NULL != urh; urh = urhn). That variable (urhn) is assigned inside the loop body (urhn = urh->prev;). Clause 3 of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not to use objects that are modified in the loop body. Because the third-clause expression reads urhn which is written in the loop body, this violates Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 requires that the third clause of a for statement may only modify the loop counter and must not use objects that are modified in the loop body. In the reported loop:\n\nfor (urh = daemon->urh_tail; NULL != urh; urh = urhn)\n{\n  ...\n  urhn = urh->prev;\n  ...\n}\n\nthe third clause reads urhn, but urhn is assigned inside the loop body. That means the third clause uses an object that is modified by the loop body, which violates Rule 14.2. (The likely reason the code does this is to capture the next/prev pointer prior to operations that may remove/modify urh, but that does not avoid the Rule 14.2 prohibition.)\n\nRecommended remediation is to rewrite the loop so the loop-control update does not depend on a variable modified inside the body (for example use a while loop and perform urh = urhn as an explicit update after urhn is set, or compute the next pointer before entering a for-style update that does not read a body-modified object)."
