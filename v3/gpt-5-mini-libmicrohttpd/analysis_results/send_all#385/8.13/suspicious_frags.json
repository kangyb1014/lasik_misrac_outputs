  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Analysis: the only pointer in the function is the parameter 'const unsigned char *buf', which is already const\u2011qualified as required. The address expression '&buf[off]' (or equivalently 'buf + off') has type 'const unsigned char *' and is cast to 'const void *' when passed to send; that cast preserves const qualification and does not drop const. There are no local non\u2011const pointer variables, no casts that remove const, and no function calls here that accept a non\u2011const pointer type requiring a const removal. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 8.13."
