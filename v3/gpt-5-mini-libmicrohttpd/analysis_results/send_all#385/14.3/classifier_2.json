  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression is (EAGAIN == errno). errno is a modifiable lvalue (implementation-defined macro/function returning per-thread storage) and can change at run-time, so the expression is not invariant. Therefore this if-statement does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
