  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression '0 == ret' is not invariant because 'ret' is assigned inside the loop from send(), so its value can change between iterations. This therefore does not breach Rule 14.3. (A violation would occur if the condition were a compile-time constant or if 'ret' could never change \u2014 e.g. 'if (0)' or an unmodified variable.)"
