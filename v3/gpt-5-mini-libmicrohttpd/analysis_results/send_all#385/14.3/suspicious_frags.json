  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (loop and conditional controls) that are invariant. The fragments selected above include the loop header and the conditionals that can make the loop control invariant or produce repeated iterations. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for this rule: - The send(...) calls (and their platform-dependent cast) are function calls and not controlling expressions. - The preprocessor #if / #else blocks are compile-time directives, not runtime controlling expressions. - Variable declarations (ssize_t ret; size_t off;) and the final return off; are not controlling expressions. - The comparisons (EAGAIN == errno), (0 > ret), and (0 == ret) are included above where they affect control; any other uses of errno or ret are runtime-varying values, not compile-time invariants. - There is no do-while or intentionally infinite-loop construct that falls under the stated exceptions. Therefore only the listed loop and conditional blocks need further investigation for potential invariant controlling expressions or cases where the controlling expression can become effectively invariant (no progress on loop variables)."
