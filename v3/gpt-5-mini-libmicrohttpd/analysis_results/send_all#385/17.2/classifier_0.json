  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls the standard socket function 'send', not the enclosing function 'send_all'. There is no direct or indirect call from send_all to itself. (Only in a contrived case where 'send' were redefined as a macro or wrapper that ultimately invoked send_all would Rule 17.2 be violated.)"
