  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls the system/socket function send, not send_all. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if this call resolved (directly or indirectly) back to send_all \u2014 for example if \u2018send\u2019 were redefined as a macro or alias to send_all, or if send_all called a function that (possibly through other calls) invoked send_all again. In the given code as shown, that is not the case."
