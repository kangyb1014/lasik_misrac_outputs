  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that are most likely to hide unreachable-code issues: checks for NULL argv elements or empty argument strings (these are usually not present for argv[i] when 0 < i < argc in hosted environments), the computation/usage of p_next (which can be NULL and may make some code paths impossible or mis-guarded), the special handling of the literal \"--\" (which changes parsing state and may make later option-processing code non-applicable), and the call to abort() (a non-returning call that can make subsequent statements unreachable in that execution path).\n\nOther parts of the function do not appear to contain unreachable code and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1:\n- The main loop (for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i)) is a standard iteration over provided arguments and is reachable for any argc > 1.\n- The short/long parameter dispatch (process_short_params_str / process_long_param) is executed under explicit, runtime-dependant conditions (char contents of p) and thus can be reached depending on input; their result handling uses explicit comparisons and either adjusts i, returns, aborts, or continues, so there is no statically unreachable statement there beyond the flagged abort path.\n- The numeric-port branch (checking '0'..'9', parsing digits, range checks, assigning mhd_port) is reachable for numeric arguments and contains explicit returns on error; no dead code is present in that branch.\n- The final fallback (fprintf + return) is reachable when an argument does not match any prior condition.\n\nGiven that most branches are selected based on runtime data (the contents of argv strings), the remaining statements are conditionally reachable and do not constitute statically unreachable code under ordinary assumptions. The listed fragments should be inspected further to confirm whether (a) NULL argv elements or empty strings can in fact occur in the target environment, (b) p_next being NULL is correctly handled by the called functions, and (c) the use of abort() is intentional and compatible with project safety rules."
