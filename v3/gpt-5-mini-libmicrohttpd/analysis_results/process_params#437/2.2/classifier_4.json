  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_params:\n```c\nstatic int\nprocess_params (int argc, char *const *argv)\n{\n  int proc_dash_param = ! 0;\n  int i;\n  for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i)\n  {\n    /**\n     * The currently processed argument\n     */\n    const char *const p = argv[i];\n    const char *const p_next = (argc == (i + 1)) ?

  "scenario": "The branch calls abort() when param_res == PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR. This is not dead code: abort() is an observable action (terminates the program), so if that branch can be taken its removal would change behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. The only way a violation could occur is if it is both (a) executed at runtime and (b) removable without changing behaviour (e.g. abort() is effectively a no-op due to platform-specific stubbing), which is not evident from the provided code. If static analysis proves that PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR can never be returned by process_long_param/process_short_params_str and the branch is unreachable, that would be unreachable code (note 2) and not classified as dead code under Rule 2.2."
