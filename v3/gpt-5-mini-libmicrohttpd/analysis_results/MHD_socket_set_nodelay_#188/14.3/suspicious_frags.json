  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The only conditional-like construct is the conditional (?:) operator with the controlling expression 'on', which is a function parameter (not a compile-time constant) and therefore not an invariant. There are no if, while, for, do-while or switch statements whose controlling expressions are constant/invariant. The preprocessor #ifdef TCP_NODELAY is a build-time conditional and not a C-language controlling expression governed by MISRA Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant investigation for Rule 14.3."
