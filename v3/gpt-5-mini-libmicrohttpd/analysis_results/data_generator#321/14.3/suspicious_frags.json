  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is: if (max < 80) return 0; \u2014 its controlling expression depends on the parameter 'max' and is therefore not invariant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The (void) cls; and (void) pos; lines are casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings and are not controlling expressions. The use of the constant index buf[79] is an array access, not a controlling expression; it is guarded by the non-invariant check on 'max'. The function returning the constant 80 is not a controlling expression either. For these reasons, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
