  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation provided the function contract holds: the code checks if (max < 80) and only proceeds when max >= 80, so memset(buf, 'A', max - 1) writes bytes 0..(max-2) which is within a buffer of size max. A violation would occur only if the caller supplies an incorrect max (i.e. buf actually has fewer than max bytes) \u2014 in that case memset could write beyond the bounds of the object referenced by buf."
