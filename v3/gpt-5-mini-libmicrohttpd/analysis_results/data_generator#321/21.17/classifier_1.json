  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement \"return 80;\" itself does not use any functions from <string.h> and cannot by itself cause an out-of-bounds access. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. Note: the function does call memset(buf, 'A', max - 1) before the return; that call would violate Rule 21.17 if the caller supplies a max larger than the actual allocated size of buf (for example, if buf points to an 80\u2011byte buffer but max == 100, memset would attempt to write 99 bytes and overflow the buffer)."
