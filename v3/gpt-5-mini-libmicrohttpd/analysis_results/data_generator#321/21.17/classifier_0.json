  "scenario": "The if (max < 80) return 0; guard ensures that subsequent uses of buf (memset(buf, 'A', max - 1) and buf[79] = '\\n') only occur when max >= 80. Without this check, buf[79] could be accessed when max < 80 (out-of-bounds), violating Rule 21.17. With the guard present, the code prevents that out-of-bounds access."
