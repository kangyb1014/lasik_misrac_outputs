  "explanation": "The function body contains no calls to data_generator (no direct recursion) and makes no indirect calls that could invoke data_generator:\n- The only function call is memset, a standard library function that does not reference user callbacks here.\n- The parameters cls and pos are explicitly cast to void and are unused, so there is no use of a function-pointer or callback passed in via cls that could cause an indirect call to data_generator.\n- There are no other function calls or global variable accesses in the body that could lead to an indirect call chain back to data_generator.\n- The function is static (limited linkage) but that does not introduce recursion by itself.\nTherefore, based solely on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calls and no fragments warranting further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. If data_generator is registered as a callback elsewhere in the program, that external code would need review for potential indirect recursion, but that is outside the supplied code and thus not flagged here."
