  "explanation": "No other compiler/language extensions are present. The body uses only standard C constructs and standard library functions (memset, array indexing, (void) cast to suppress unused-parameter warnings). uint64_t and size_t are standard fixed-width/size types (stdint.h / stddef.h). There are no GCC/Clang-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, or other vendor keywords in the rest of the code, so no other fragments require investigation."
