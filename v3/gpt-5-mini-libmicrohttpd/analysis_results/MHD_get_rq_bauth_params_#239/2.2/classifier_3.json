  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_:\n```c\nconst struct MHD_RqBAuth *\nMHD_get_rq_bauth_params_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct _MHD_str_w_len h_auth_value;\n  struct MHD_RqBAuth *bauth;\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED <= connection->state);\n\n  if (connection->rq.bauth_tried)\n    return connection->rq.bauth;\n\n  if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state)\n    return NULL;\n\n  if (! find_auth_rq_header_ (connection, MHD_AUTHTYPE_BASIC, &h_auth_value))\n  {\n    connection->rq.bauth_tried = true;\n    connection->rq.bauth = NULL;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  bauth =\n    (struct MHD_RqBAuth *)\n    MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection, sizeof (struct MHD_RqBAuth));\n\n  if (NULL == bauth)\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in the connection's pool to allocate \" \\\n                 \"for Basic Authorization header parsing.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  memset (bauth, 0, sizeof(struct MHD_RqBAuth));\n  if (parse_bauth_params (h_auth_value.str, h_auth_value.len, bauth))\n    connection->rq.bauth = bauth;\n  else\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The Basic Authorization client's header has \"\n                 \"incorrect format.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    connection->rq.bauth = NULL;\n    /* Memory in the pool remains allocated until next request */\n  }\n  connection->rq.bauth_tried = true;\n  return connection->rq.bauth;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The Basic Authorization client's header has \"\n                 \"incorrect format.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a conditionally compiled logging call (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES). If HAVE_MESSAGES is defined the call executes when parse_bauth_params fails and produces observable behaviour (logging, timing, resource use) so its removal would change program behaviour; if HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined the code is not compiled in (not reachable). Hence this is not dead code and does not violate Rule 2.2."
