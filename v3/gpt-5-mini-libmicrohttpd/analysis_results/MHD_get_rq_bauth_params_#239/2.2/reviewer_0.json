In that configuration the assertion call is dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert performs a runtime check that can abort/log or otherwise alter behaviour when the condition fails, then the statement is not dead code and no violation occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in substance. Whether the mhd_assert call is dead code depends on how mhd_assert is defined for the project. If mhd_assert is a debug-only or no-op macro (for example expands to ((void)0) or is omitted in release builds) then the statement has no observable effect at runtime and its removal would not alter program behaviour; that meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so a violation would occur. If, on the other hand, mhd_assert performs an observable runtime action (abort, logging, raising an error, etc.), then it is not dead code and no Rule 2.2 violation arises. Note also that the subsequent explicit runtime check (if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state) return NULL;) makes the assertion redundant in builds where it is a no-op, which reinforces the dead-code diagnosis in that configuration."
