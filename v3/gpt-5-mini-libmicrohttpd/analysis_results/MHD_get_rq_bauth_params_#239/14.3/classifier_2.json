  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The token MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED <= connection->state is used as the argument to the mhd_assert macro, not as the controlling expression of a selection or iteration statement. Therefore it is not subject to Rule 14.3. Furthermore the expression is not an invariant at compile time (it depends on connection->state). If the mhd_assert macro expands to a do { ... } while (0) idiom, the controlling expression of that do-while would be the constant 0; such a do-while with a false integer constant expression is explicitly permitted by the rule exceptions. If mhd_assert instead expands to an if that tests the expression, that if\u2019s controlling expression would not be invariant because it depends on connection->state. In all realistic expansions this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
