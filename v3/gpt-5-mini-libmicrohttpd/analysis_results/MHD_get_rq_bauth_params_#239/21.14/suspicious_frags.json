  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function: the source contains no calls to memcmp nor any comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp. All string/header data here are handled via structures carrying explicit lengths (h_auth_value.len) and are passed to helper functions (find_auth_rq_header_, parse_bauth_params_) that are outside the presented fragment; these calls do not themselves show any memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments within the given function that directly violate or need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If required, the implementations of the external functions (find_auth_rq_header_ and parse_bauth_params) should be inspected separately for any memcmp usage on null-terminated strings."
