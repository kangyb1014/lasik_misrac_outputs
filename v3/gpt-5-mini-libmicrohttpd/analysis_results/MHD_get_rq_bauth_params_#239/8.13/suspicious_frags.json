  "explanation": "Only code fragments that involve pointer types and their use are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). The selected fragments cover: the non-const local pointer declaration (bauth), the allocation and cast to a non-const pointer, the modification of the pointed object (memset and parse_bauth_params using bauth), assignment of that pointer into the connection->rq.bauth slot, and the returned pointer. These are the locations where a const qualification might be applicable or where a non-const pointer is propagated to a possibly const-returning context and therefore should be investigated. Other lines in the function (assertions, state checks, boolean flags, logging, early returns, NULL checks, and the local declaration of h_auth_value itself) do not declare or propagate pointer types in a way that affects whether a pointer should be const-qualified for Rule 8.13, so they are not included for investigation."
