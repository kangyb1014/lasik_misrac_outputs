Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_update_last_activity_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_update_last_activity_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n\n  if (0 == connection->connection_timeout_ms)\n    return;  /* Skip update of activity for connections\n               without timeout timer. */\n  if (connection->suspended)\n    return;  /* no activity on suspended connections */\n\n  connection->last_activity = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  if (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon))\n    return; /* each connection has personal timeout */\n\n  if (connection->connection_timeout_ms != daemon->connection_timeout_ms)\n    return; /* custom timeout, no need to move it in \"normal\" DLL */\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n#endif\n  /* move connection to head of timeout list (by remove + add operation) */\n  XDLL_remove (daemon->normal_timeout_head,\n               daemon->normal_timeout_tail,\n               connection);\n  XDLL_insert (daemon->normal_timeout_head,\n               daemon->normal_timeout_tail,\n               connection);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

However, if in the project mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in all builds (no side effects) while MHD_USE_THREADS is defined, then the statement is an executed no-op whose removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 a violation of Rule 2.2."
