  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function and found no use of the standard library function memcmp, nor any other string-comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, etc.). The code performs numeric comparisons (e.g. connection_timeout_ms checks), pointer/null checks, assignment of last_activity, mutex lock/unlock calls, and calls to macros/functions (XDLL_remove, XDLL_insert, MHD_monotonic_msec_counter, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_) \u2014 none of which in this fragment invoke memcmp or operate on null-terminated strings. There are no char* or string buffer operations present in this snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp might be used, it would have to appear in other code (e.g. definitions of the macros/functions called), but such uses are not present in the given fragment and thus are outside the scope of this review."
