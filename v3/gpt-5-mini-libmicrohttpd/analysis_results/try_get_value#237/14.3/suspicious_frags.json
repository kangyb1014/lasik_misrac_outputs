  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (loop and conditional expressions). I included every conditional/loop controlling expression present in the function so they can be investigated for invariance. Other code fragments (assignments such as bpos = buf; klen = strlen(key); vlen computation; the calls to malloc, memcpy; and the return statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3; they do not need to be investigated for invariant controlling expressions. No other if/while/do-while controlling expressions exist in the provided code."
