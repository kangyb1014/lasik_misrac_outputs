  "explanation": "The rule concerns use of string.h functions and any pointer arithmetic or indexing that can cause those functions (or the subsequent memcpy) to access memory beyond the bounds of the objects. The fragments selected include every call to string.h functions in this function (strlen, strstr, strchr, memcpy) and the related pointer/index computations and allocation that determine their valid ranges. These are the only locations where out-of-bounds string accesses can originate. Other lines (variable declarations, the early \"if (NULL != *destination) return;\" check, bpos = buf, loop control (bpos = spos + 1), the continue/return statements, and general control flow) do not themselves invoke string.h functions or perform indexing that could directly cause accesses beyond the referenced object bounds, so they do not need separate investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
