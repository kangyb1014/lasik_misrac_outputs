  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect recursion. The only parts of this function that can introduce indirect recursion are calls to other functions (they might, in some build/configuration, call back into try_get_value). The listed fragments are all function-call expressions present in the code. Other code fragments (variable declarations, pointer arithmetic, index checks like spos[klen], conditional checks, assignments, returns, the NULL checks, the loop control and string literal usage) do not invoke any functions and therefore cannot by themselves create direct or indirect recursion; they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. Also there are no function pointer calls or references to try_get_value within the function body, so no other constructs are relevant to potential recursion."
