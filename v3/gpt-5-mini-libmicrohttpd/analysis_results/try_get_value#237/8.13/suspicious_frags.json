  "explanation": "The only non-const pointer-to-object usage in this function is the 'destination' parameter and the places where it is read or written. Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types; 'buf', 'key' and the local pointer variables (spos, bpos, endv) are already declared as const char * and therefore comply. The standard library calls (strstr, strchr, strlen, memcpy, malloc) are used in conventional ways and do not introduce additional pointer-to-non-const targets beyond the explicit 'destination' parameter. The listed fragments include the function declaration containing 'char **destination' and every site that dereferences or assigns through that non-const pointer; no other lines in the function present pointer-to-non-const issues requiring investigation under Rule 8.13."
