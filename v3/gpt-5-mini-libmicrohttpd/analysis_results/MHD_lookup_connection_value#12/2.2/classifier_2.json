The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_connection_value:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_lookup_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key)\n{\n  const char *value;\n\n  value = NULL;\n  (void) MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                        kind,\n                                        key,\n                                        (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key),\n                                        &value,\n                                        NULL);\n  return value;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvalue = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If the callee MHD_lookup_connection_value_n unconditionally assigns to the out-parameter (i.e. always writes to *value on every execution path), the prior assignment value = NULL; is overwritten before any use. Removing that line would not change program behaviour, so the assignment is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
