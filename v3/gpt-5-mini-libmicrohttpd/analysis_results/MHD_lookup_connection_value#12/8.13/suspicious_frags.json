  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: the function return type is const char * (already const-qualified), the local variable is declared as const char * (already const-qualified), the key parameter is const char * (already const-qualified), the ternary expression using strlen on the const key is valid, the initialization value = NULL and the (void) cast of the call are not related to pointer const-qualification. Therefore only the non-const pointer parameter and the pointer-to-pointer usage in the call need inspection to determine whether they could or should be const-qualified."
