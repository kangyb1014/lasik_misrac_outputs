  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the given function. It is a simple wrapper that: initializes value, calls MHD_lookup_connection_value_n and then returns value. There are no statements after the return, no conditional branches that make any subsequent statements unreachable, no labels/goto, no infinite loops, and the ternary expression (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen(key) prevents calling strlen on a NULL pointer. Therefore there are no code fragments inside this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n\nNote/clarification: this assessment is limited to the shown function body. If the implementation or macro definition of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (or any non-returning attribute on that symbol) were such that the call does not return or recursively links back to this function in a way that produces unreachable code elsewhere, that would need inspection \u2014 but that concern lies outside the provided code fragment."
