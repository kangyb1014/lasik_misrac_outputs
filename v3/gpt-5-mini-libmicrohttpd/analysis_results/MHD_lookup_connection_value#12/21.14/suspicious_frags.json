  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided fragment. The function only calls strlen (with a NULL check) and then calls MHD_lookup_connection_value_n passing an explicit length parameter; this avoids relying on memcmp to compare null-terminated strings within this fragment. The ternary (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen(key) prevents passing a NULL pointer to strlen. Therefore there are no code fragments here that match MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If rule compliance of memcmp usage is to be assessed, the implementation of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n should be inspected, but that implementation is not included in the given code.)"
