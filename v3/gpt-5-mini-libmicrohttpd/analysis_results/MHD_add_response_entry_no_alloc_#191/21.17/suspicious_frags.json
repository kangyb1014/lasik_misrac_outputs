  "explanation": "The function itself does not call any <string.h> routines, but it stores caller-supplied char* pointers together with explicit lengths into the newly allocated header structure and then inserts that structure into the response. The listed fragments (function parameters, the non-zero length assertions, the assignments of pointers and sizes, and the insertion call) are the places that must be investigated because later use of hdr->header or hdr->value by string.h functions could access beyond the provided bounds unless those later uses respect the provided sizes or ensure proper null-termination. Other fragments in this short function are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17: the allocation check for hdr and the final \"return true;\" do not perform or trigger any string.h operations or pointer dereferences on the header/value buffers themselves, so they do not themselves create risks under Rule 21.17."
