  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                  enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                                  char *header,\n                                  size_t header_len,\n                                  char *content,\n                                  size_t content_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *hdr;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != header_len);\n  mhd_assert (0 != content_len);\n  if (NULL == (hdr = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header))))\n    return false;\n\n  hdr->header = header;\n  hdr->header_size = header_len;\n  hdr->value = content;\n  hdr->value_size = content_len;\n  hdr->kind = kind;\n  _MHD_insert_header_last (response, hdr);\n\n  return true; /* Success exit point */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nhdr->header = header;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for the shown fragment in normal use: the assignment stores the header pointer into a newly allocated response header structure that is inserted into the response list; removing this store would change program behaviour because later code that sends or inspects response headers will read hdr->header. \n\nA specific violation scenario (hypothetical): if elsewhere in the project the hdr->header field is never read (for example the code only uses hdr->header_size and copies header data elsewhere before insertion, or the send/serialize path only uses hdr->value and hdr->header is never referenced), then the assignment hdr->header = header; would be dead code \u2014 removing it would not affect behaviour and thus would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
