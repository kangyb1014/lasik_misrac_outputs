  "explanation": "I examined all function parameters: response, kind, header, header_len, content, content_len. The code does not modify any of these parameter variables. It only copies their values into the newly allocated hdr fields (hdr->header = header; hdr->value = content; hdr->header_size = header_len; hdr->value_size = content_len; hdr->kind = kind) and passes response to _MHD_insert_header_last. There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers themselves (e.g., no \"header = ...\", \"content = ...\", or \"response = ...\"), nor any pointer arithmetic that would change the pointer parameters. Dereferencing of the pointer parameters to modify their pointees also does not occur. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
