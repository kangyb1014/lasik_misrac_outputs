True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe assignment `uc->pp = NULL;` is redundant: the code destroys the post-processor with MHD_destroy_post_processor(uc->pp) and later frees `uc` with free(uc). There are no subsequent accesses to `uc` or `uc->pp` after this assignment, so removing it would not alter program behaviour. Therefore this operation qualifies as dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The assignment uc->pp = NULL; is redundant in the shown function. After MHD_destroy_post_processor(uc->pp) there are no further reads of uc->pp (the code later frees uc), so changing or removing that single assignment would not alter the observable behaviour of this function as presented. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cany operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), the assignment meets the definition of dead code.\n\nCaveat: if there is external/ concurrent code that can observe uc between the assignment and the ensuing free (or if the lifetime/ownership of uc extends beyond this function), then the assignment might affect behaviour and would not be dead. No such concurrency/extended-lifetime behaviour is present in the provided snippet, so the reported violation is reasonable. Recommended fixes are to remove the superfluous assignment or, if the intent was to prevent later use via the req_cls pointer, explicitly clear *req_cls (or otherwise document/synchronize ownership)."
