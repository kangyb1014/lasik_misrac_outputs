  "explanation": "The three pointer parameters in the function signature are potentially over-writable and should be checked to see whether they could/should be const-qualified: 'cls' and 'connection' are not used (only cast to void) so they could reasonably be declared as pointing to const-qualified types; 'req_cls' is a pointer-to-pointer and its usage should be reviewed to determine whether the pointed-to type could be const-qualified without preventing required modifications via other aliases. Other fragments were not flagged because they involve pointers used to modify the pointed-to objects (so const-qualification would be inappropriate): 'uc' is dereferenced and the UploadContext contents are changed (uc->pp set to NULL, uc->fd closed, uc->filename freed), uc->pp and uc->filename are modified/freed, and the code performs resource-release operations (close, unlink, free) that operate on modifiable objects. The enum parameter 'toe' is not a pointer (passed by value) and thus is not relevant to Rule 8.13."
