  "explanation": "Recursion (direct or indirect) can only originate from function calls made inside this function. The fragments listed above are all call expressions present in the code and should be inspected to determine whether any of those functions (or functions they call) can call response_completed_callback, directly or indirectly. Other parts of the function do not involve calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion: the variable declaration/assignment (struct UploadContext *uc = *req_cls;), the (void) casts used to silence warnings, the NULL checks and conditional branches, the assignments that null out pointers (uc->pp = NULL;), and the early return are not call sites and so do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
