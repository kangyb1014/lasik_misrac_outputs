  "scenario": "Not violated in the provided code as-is. The call to MHD_destroy_post_processor(uc->pp) is a plain library call and does not itself call response_completed_callback, so there is no direct or indirect self-call in the shown function. A specific violation scenario would be: if MHD_destroy_post_processor (or the post-processor object\u2019s destruction) synchronously invoked the request-completion callback (response_completed_callback) \u2014 for example by invoking a user-supplied cleanup callback or triggering the server to call the request termination handler \u2014 that would cause response_completed_callback to be entered again (indirect recursion) and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
