  "explanation": "I flag the uses of __asan_region_is_poisoned and __asan_address_is_poisoned (and the conditional compilation that enables them) because these are AddressSanitizer/implementation-provided routines that are compiler/toolchain-specific features and are commonly documented as compiler/runtime extensions. Those calls should be investigated to confirm they are allowed with respect to MISRA Rule 1.2.\n\nThe rest of the function uses ordinary, standard C constructs (size_t, pointers, memset, preprocessor conditionals, user macros like mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, and identifiers such as _MHD_POISON_MEMORY/_MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE which appear to be project macros). The backslash used in the multi-line macro call is a standard C source line-continuation and not a compiler extension. There are no other obvious compiler-specific language extensions (e.g. GCC statement-expressions, nested functions, __attribute__ annotations, inline assembler, typeof, or other implementation-specific language constructs) in the remaining code, so those parts do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
