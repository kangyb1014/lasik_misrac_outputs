  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the build configuration where MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE is defined but neither HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED nor HAVE___ASAN_ADDRESS_IS_POISONED is defined, the code executes the branch that does need_red_zone_before = true; immediately before the test if (need_red_zone_before). After preprocessing the assignment is a constant true, so the controlling expression evaluates to true in all runs of that translation unit \u2014 i.e. it is invariant. This is not one of the permitted exceptions to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (it is not an infinite loop nor the special do-while case), so the code violates Rule 14.3 in that configuration. Note that in other configurations (when the HAVE___ASAN_* macros are defined) the expression may be non\u2011invariant, but the scenario given (neither macro defined) yields a valid Rule 14.3 violation."
