  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three (void) parameter casts are the common, intentional idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics; they document author intent and affect diagnostics/maintainability even though they have no runtime side effects. MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns dead code that affects program behaviour if removed. Removing these casts would not change program behaviour, but they are not considered gratuitous/erroneous dead code in the sense the rule is intended to prevent \u2014 they serve a purpose (silencing warnings and documenting intent). Thus the claim that the explicit (void) connection; (and the similar casts) are a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect. If your project policy forbids such no-op statements, use an agreed UNUSED macro or compiler attribute for unused parameters, but that is a stylistic/enforcement choice, not a Rule 2.2 violation per se."
