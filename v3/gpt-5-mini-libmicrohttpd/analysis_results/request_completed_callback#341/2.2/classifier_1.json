Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of request_completed_callback:\n```c\nstatic void\nrequest_completed_callback (void *cls,\n                            struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            void **req_cls,\n                            enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct Request *request = *req_cls;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The expression statement '(void) cls;' is an executed no-op used only to suppress a compiler warning. Its removal would not alter program behaviour, therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The same applies to the similar lines '(void) connection;' and '(void) toe;'.)"
