  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The parameter 'cls' is not used or modified in the function, so it could be declared as 'const void *cls'. If this function is implementing an external callback API (e.g. the MHD library) whose prototype requires 'void *cls', then the signature cannot be changed and Rule 8.13 is not violated. If this is an internal function and the signature is free to change, declaring it as 'const void *cls' would be required by Rule 8.13 \u2014 otherwise the rule is violated."
