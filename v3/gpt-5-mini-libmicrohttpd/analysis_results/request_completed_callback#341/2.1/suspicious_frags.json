  "explanation": "All executable statements inside the function have been listed above. The function signature and the closing brace are not executable code and therefore cannot be \"unreachable\" in the sense of MISRA Rule 2.1. There are no other statements, labels or dead branches in the provided snippet beyond the fragments already reported. Investigations should therefore focus on the listed statements (e.g. whether req_cls can be NULL, whether certain branches are never taken in the project, or whether objects are always/never initialized), since no other code in this snippet could cause unreachable-code violations."
