  "explanation": "The provided function contains no calls to memcmp, no string comparisons (e.g. strcmp, strncmp), and no code that compares or inspects null-terminated strings. All comparisons are pointer/NULL checks and there are calls to MHD_destroy_post_processor and free, but those are not memcmp uses within this translation unit. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
