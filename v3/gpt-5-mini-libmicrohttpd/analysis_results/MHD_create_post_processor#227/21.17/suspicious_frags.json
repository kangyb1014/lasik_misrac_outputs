  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 concern is reads by string.h routines or any code that assumes NUL-termination of a pointed-to object. The selected fragments either call standard string functions that read until a NUL (strstr, strlen) or perform pointer arithmetic / obtain the header value pointer (lookup call and subsequent pointer adjustments) that lead into those calls. These must be investigated to ensure the 'encoding' / 'boundary' objects are valid and NUL-terminated for the full accesses performed.\n\nOther code fragments in the function do not call standard <string.h> functions nor do they perform unabound reads: comparison helpers used earlier (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) are explicit-length comparisons (do not rely on NUL termination), size checks and bounds tests guard subsequent indexing/uses, memory allocation and struct initialisation do not involve string.h reads, and the later check of blen before indexing ensures that the explicit index accesses are bounded. Therefore those other parts are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation here."
