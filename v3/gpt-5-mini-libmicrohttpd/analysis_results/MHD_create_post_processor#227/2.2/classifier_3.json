  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_post_processor:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_PostProcessor *\nMHD_create_post_processor (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                           size_t buffer_size,\n                           MHD_PostDataIterator iter,\n                           void *iter_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_PostProcessor *ret;\n  const char *encoding;\n  const char *boundary;\n  size_t blen;\n\n  if ( (buffer_size < 256) ||\n       (NULL == connection) ||\n       (NULL == iter))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"libmicrohttpd API violation.\\n\"));\n  encoding = NULL;\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                     MHD_HEADER_KIND,\n                                     MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                     MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\n                                       MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE),\n                                     &encoding,\n                                     NULL))\n    return NULL;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != encoding);\n  boundary = NULL;\n  if (!

  "scenario": "The assignment 'boundary = NULL;' is not dead code. 'boundary' is declared uninitialized and in the code path where the content-type equals application/x-www-form-urlencoded the multipart-handling branch is skipped (blen is set to 0 in the else) and 'boundary' must remain NULL; it is later stored into ret->boundary. Removing the assignment would leave 'boundary' uninitialized in that branch (undefined behaviour) and thus would change program behaviour."
