Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_post_processor:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_PostProcessor *\nMHD_create_post_processor (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                           size_t buffer_size,\n                           MHD_PostDataIterator iter,\n                           void *iter_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_PostProcessor *ret;\n  const char *encoding;\n  const char *boundary;\n  size_t blen;\n\n  if ( (buffer_size < 256) ||\n       (NULL == connection) ||\n       (NULL == iter))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"libmicrohttpd API violation.\\n\"));\n  encoding = NULL;\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                     MHD_HEADER_KIND,\n                                     MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                     MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\n                                       MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE),\n                                     &encoding,\n                                     NULL))\n    return NULL;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != encoding);\n  boundary = NULL;\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the conditional contains an assignment of the result of MHD_calloc_ to ret and a NULL check. This allocation and the resulting control flow affect program behaviour (memory allocation and potential early return). Removing the assignment/check would change program behaviour, so this is not dead code."
