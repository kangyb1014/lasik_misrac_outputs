  "explanation": "I flagged all code locations in this function where non-const pointer types are introduced, passed in, assigned to structure members, or where a non-const-returning routine is used and the result is stored in a const-qualified variable \u2014 these are the places most relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Other fragments were not flagged because:\n\n- Declarations that are already const-qualified (e.g. \"const char *encoding;\" and \"const char *boundary;\") do not need investigation for 8.13 in this function \u2014 they already use const. \n\n- Calls that pass those const-qualified pointers to functions which accept const parameters (e.g. MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n as used here) are consistent with const qualification and therefore not suspicious for this rule.\n\n- Pointer arithmetic and pointer-value adjustments in the code (e.g. incrementing the boundary pointer, computing blen) modify the pointer value, not the pointed-to object; these do not by themselves indicate missing const qualification of the pointed-to type.\n\n- Non-pointer variables and assignments (size_t, enums, state fields, numeric comparisons, memory-size calculations, returns of NULL checks, etc.) are irrelevant to Rule 8.13 and were therefore not included.\n\nIf additional context (definitions of struct MHD_PostProcessor, types of its members, and the typedef for MHD_PostDataIterator) is provided, a more precise determination can be made about whether the flagged pointer parameters and assignments indeed should use const-qualified pointer types or whether the struct/member declarations already require non-const pointers."
