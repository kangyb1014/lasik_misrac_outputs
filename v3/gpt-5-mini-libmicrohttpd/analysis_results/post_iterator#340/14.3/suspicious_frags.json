  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Each conditional depends on runtime data or variables, so they do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3:\n\n- if (0 == strcmp (\"DONE\", key)) \u2014 strcmp uses the runtime value of key; result is not a compile-time constant.\n- if (0 == strcmp (\"v1\", key)) and if (0 == strcmp (\"v2\", key)) \u2014 same reasoning.\n- if (off >= sizeof(session->value_1) - 1) and if (size + off >= sizeof(session->value_1)) (and the analogous checks for value_2) \u2014 these comparisons involve the runtime variables off and size; sizeof(...) is a compile-time constant but the overall expressions depend on runtime values and therefore are not invariant.\n\nThere are no loops with constant controlling expressions (e.g., while(1) or for(;;)) and no do-while constructs that would fall under the listed exceptions. The (void) casts are not controlling expressions. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
