The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other statements in the function affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2: the strcmp checks drive control flow; the fprintf calls produce observable output; the memcpy and subsequent NUL-termination modify session->value_1/value_2 which are used later; the bounds checks and size adjustments affect what data is copied; and each return controls function outcome. There is no unreachable code in the fragment. The only operations that are executed yet have no effect on program behaviour (and thus warrant inspection for dead-code) are the explicit (void) casts used to silence unused-parameter warnings; no other lines meet the definition of dead code here."
