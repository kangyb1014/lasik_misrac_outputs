  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. All function parameters that can and should point to const-qualified types already do so: key, filename, content_type, transfer_encoding and data are declared as const char *. The data pointer is used only as the source argument to memcpy (which expects a const void *), so const-qualified pointee is appropriate. The cls parameter is a non-const void * because the function obtains request->session and modifies session->value_1 and session->value_2 via memcpy and by writing the terminating '\\0'; therefore cls (and the derived request/session pointers) cannot be made to point to const-qualified types. The destinations passed to memcpy (&session->value_1[off], &session->value_2[off]) must be non-const because they are written to. String literals used as format strings are inherently non-modifiable by the code and are passed where const char * is expected. For these reasons there are no pointer targets here that can be further const-qualified without changing semantics or preventing required modifications."
