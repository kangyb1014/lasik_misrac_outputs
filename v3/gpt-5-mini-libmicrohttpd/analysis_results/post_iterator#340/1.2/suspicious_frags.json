  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code snippet. I checked for common compiler-specific extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, and found none: \n\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example, __attribute__, __declspec, __inline__, __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other GCC/MSVC/clang extensions). \n- No inline assembly or platform-specific calling-convention specifiers. \n- No use of nonstandard preprocessor constructs or pragmas visible in the snippet. \n- The integer types (uint64_t, size_t) are standard types from ISO C headers (stdint.h, stddef.h / stdint.h) and are not compiler extensions. \n- The casts, enum parameter/return types, (void) unused-parameter idiom, memcpy, strcmp, fprintf, and sizeof usage are all standard C and not extensions. \n- Identifiers such as MHD_YES, enum MHD_Result, enum MHD_ValueKind, and struct members are library-specific (libmicrohttpd-like) symbols; their presence does not imply a language extension in this function body. If those external declarations themselves used compiler-specific extensions, that would need to be inspected in their definitions, but the code shown does not use any extension syntax.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this snippet that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
