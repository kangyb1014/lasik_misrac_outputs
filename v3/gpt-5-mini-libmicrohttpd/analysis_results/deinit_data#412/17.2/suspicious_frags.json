  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.2 concerns functions calling themselves directly or indirectly. The only code locations that can introduce indirect recursion are places that call other functions which might call back into deinit_data. The remaining fragments in this function are simple pointer null-checks, assignments to NULL, the loop control and the num_resps = 0 assignment. Those do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves create direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
