  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown code: free(resps) is inside the conditional if (NULL != resps) and will execute whenever resps is non-NULL, so it is reachable. A concrete violation scenario would be if resps were provably always NULL at this point (for example, resps is initialized to NULL and never assigned a non-NULL value before this function is called, or resps is unconditionally set to NULL immediately prior to the if). In that case the entire if-body (including free(resps)) would be unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
