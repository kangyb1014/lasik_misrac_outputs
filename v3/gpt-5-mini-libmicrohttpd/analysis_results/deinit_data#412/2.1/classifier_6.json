  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment 'resp_single = NULL;' is reachable and will execute whenever deinit_data() is called (it follows an if-check but is not guarded by any early return or unconditional jump). A concrete violation scenario would be if an unconditional return or goto occurred before the assignment (for example inserting 'return;' immediately before 'resp_single = NULL;'), in which case that assignment would become unreachable and thus violate Rule 2.1."
