  "explanation": "The function deinit_data has the signature deinit_data(void) and therefore takes no parameters; MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters (specifically altering the pointer parameter itself). All pointer variables referenced in this function (resp_single, resps, body_dyn) are not function parameters but appear to be file\u2011scope or global variables; modifying or resetting such globals and freeing/destroying the objects they point to is not a Rule 17.8 violation. The loop index i is a local variable. Calls to MHD_destroy_response and free operate on the objects pointed to (which is permitted) or deallocate memory; none of these operations modify a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
