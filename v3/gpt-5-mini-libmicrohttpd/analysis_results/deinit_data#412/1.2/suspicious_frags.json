  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the given function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function with a (void) parameter, NULL checks, calls to functions (MHD_destroy_response, free), a block-scoped unsigned int declaration followed by a standard for loop, pointer assignments to NULL, and simple arithmetic (++i). There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_* intrinsics, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, __extension__, inline assembler, nonstandard integer types or suffixes, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2."
