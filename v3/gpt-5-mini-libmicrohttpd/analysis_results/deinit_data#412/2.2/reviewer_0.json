Therefore the conditional test/branch constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 in the typical case.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids code that is provably dead across the project (i.e. an operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour). You cannot conclude that the NULL test before free(body_dyn) is dead simply from the snippet: although the C standard requires free(NULL) to have no effect, MISRA explicitly notes that observable behaviour of an embedded system can include timing and other side effects, and a project may use a non\u2011standard or instrumented allocator where calling free(NULL) is not equivalent to skipping a call. Removing the test can therefore change timing or interactions with instrumentation or custom allocators. In short, without project\u2011level evidence that calling free(NULL) (and removing the branch) would never change any observable behaviour, the conditional cannot be declared dead and Rule 2.2 is not violated by the code shown."
