  "explanation": "Only statements that involve pointer objects or pointer dereferencing are relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13 (whether the pointed-to type could/should be const). The remaining constructs in the function are not relevant: the local loop index declaration (\"unsigned int i;\"), the integer count update (\"num_resps = 0;\"), the NULL checks syntactically guard pointer operations but by themselves do not bear on the pointed-to type qualification, and the surrounding control-flow/bracing has no effect on whether pointer targets should be const-qualified. Therefore only the calls and operations that pass, free, or assign pointer variables (listed above) need investigation for possible missing const qualification."
