  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: resps is being freed and also modified (indexed and set to NULL) so it must be a pointer to modifiable storage; Rule 8.13 concerns declaring pointers to const where possible. The call free(resps) is correct because free expects a pointer to non-const storage (void *). A violation would occur only if resps were declared as pointing to non-const data even though the pointed-to data could have been const-qualified (for example, if resps only ever read data and never modified it), but that is not the case here."
