  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The resps pointer names an array of mutable response pointers that are passed to MHD_destroy_response(resps[i]) (which must take a non\u2011const pointer because it destroys/frees/modifies the response objects) and the array itself is freed with free(resps) (free requires a modifiable pointer). Because the code must destroy and free the pointed\u2011to objects and the array, const qualification on the pointee would not be possible here."
