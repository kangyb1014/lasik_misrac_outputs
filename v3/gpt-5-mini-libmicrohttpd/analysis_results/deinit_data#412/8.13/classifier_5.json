  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: resp_single is passed to MHD_destroy_response which by its name/usage must modify/free the pointed object, so resp_single must be a pointer to a non-const type; therefore making it const would be incorrect and Rule 8.13 does not require const here. (A possible violation would occur if resp_single were only ever used for read-only operations and never modified/freed \u2014 in that case it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type.)"
