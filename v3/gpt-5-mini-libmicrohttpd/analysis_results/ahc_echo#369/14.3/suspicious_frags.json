  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are compile-time/invariant constant expressions. Reasoning for each control construct:\n- if (0 != strcmp (method, \"GET\")) \u2014 strcmp is a runtime function and depends on the incoming method string; not invariant.\n- if (&aptr != *req_cls) \u2014 compares the address of a static local with a pointer provided at runtime; *req_cls is not a compile-time constant, so this is not invariant.\n- The complex boolean assigned to fail contains runtime values (auth_info, fields username_len/password_len, memcmp results); although it uses constant subexpressions like strlen(\"Aladdin\"), the overall expression depends on runtime data and is not invariant.\n- if (fail) and if (NULL != auth_info) \u2014 both depend on earlier runtime results and are therefore not invariant.\n- There are no loop constructs (for/while/do) with constant controlling expressions; no infinite-loop pattern using a constant controlling expression is present.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
