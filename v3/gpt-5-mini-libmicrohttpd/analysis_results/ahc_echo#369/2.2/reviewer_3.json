  "explanation": "The (void)version; statement is an expression statement that does nothing at runtime. According to the text of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 \u2014 \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d \u2014 that cast-to-void statement is dead code: it is executed (syntactically an expression statement) and removing it would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour. The same reasoning applies to the other (void) casts in the function used solely to suppress unused-parameter warnings. Therefore, under a literal reading of Rule 2.2, Agent A\u2019s report is correct.\n\nNote: many projects use (void)param; idioms to silence compiler warnings; such usage is common and sometimes accepted by teams via documented deviations or by using alternative approaches (compiler-specific attributes, omission in prototypes where allowed, or wrapper macros). If compliance is required, replace these idioms with an allowed and justified mechanism (for example, a documented deviation, compiler-specific unused-parameter attribute, or another MISRA-approved pattern)."
