Removing that statement would not change program behaviour (upload_data is a non-volatile parameter and the cast has no side-effects), so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. The (void)upload_data; idiom is an explicit, deliberate no\u2011op used to document an intentionally unused parameter and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; in practice removing the cast could change observable aspects of the build/execution environment (compiler diagnostics and\u2014on some targets\u2014timing), so it is not appropriate to categorise this idiom as dead code under the rule. More importantly, this pattern is the conventional, intended way to mark unused parameters and is not the kind of unintended dead code Rule 2.2 aims to forbid."
