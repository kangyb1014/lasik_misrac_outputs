Because it is executed but has no effect, it constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines like \u201c(void) url;\u201d are the standard idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and do not constitute the kind of \"dead code\" that MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. They produce no observable runtime effect (and in practice produce no emitted code), serve only to suppress compiler warnings / document intent, and are not an executed operation whose removal would change the program\u2019s behaviour in the intended MISRA sense. (Note that if a parameter access had observable side\u2011effects \u2014 e.g. volatile access \u2014 that would be different, but that is not the case here.) Therefore the claim that those casts violate Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
