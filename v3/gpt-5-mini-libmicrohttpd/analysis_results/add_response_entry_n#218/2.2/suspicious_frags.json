  "explanation": "I have included every conditional-return check and the final return that appear in the function body \u2014 these are the operations that could potentially be redundant or effectively dead in some build/config/use cases and therefore should be investigated for Rule 2.2 (dead code). The remaining parts of the snippet (function signature, parameter list, braces and whitespace) are structural and not executable operations that could be dead; there are no other statements, local variables or branches in the function that would need inspection for dead code. I therefore did not list the function header or closing brace. If deeper context (other translation units, macros or build-time configuration) is available, the listed checks and the final call are the appropriate places to start investigating whether any of those operations are truly dead (i.e. always true/false or otherwise removable without changing behaviour)."
