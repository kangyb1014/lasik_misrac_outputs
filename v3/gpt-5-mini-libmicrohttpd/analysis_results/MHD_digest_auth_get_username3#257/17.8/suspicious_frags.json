  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter: \"struct MHD_Connection *connection\". Scanning the body shows no assignment to the parameter variable (no occurrences of \"connection = ...\", no pointer arithmetic on connection, no reassignments or mutations of the pointer itself). Calls that pass connection (MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_(connection)) may operate on the object pointed to \u2014 which is permitted by Rule 17.8 \u2014 but the pointer parameter is not modified in this function. All other pointer writes (e.g., writing into uname_info, unif_buf_ptr) operate on local variables/allocated objects, not on a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation with respect to this rule."
