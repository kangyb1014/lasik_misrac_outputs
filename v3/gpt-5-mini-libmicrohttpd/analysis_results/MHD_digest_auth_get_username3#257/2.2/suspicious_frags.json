  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not appear to be candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they perform essential runtime actions or affect program behaviour: obtaining params and early returns (MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_ and NULL checks) control flow decisions (checks of uname_type and uname_info->uname_type with corresponding free/return), the allocation via MHD_calloc_ and subsequent use of uname_info/unif_buf_ptr (the buffer pointer arithmetic and passing that buffer to get_rq_uname), and the final assignment uname_info->algo3 = params->algo3 which sets state used by callers. Those operations affect program output or resource state and therefore are not dead code. The listed suspicious fragments should be investigated because the unif_buf_used variable and the assertion/void-cast usages may be compiled-out or otherwise have no effect in some build configurations, which could lead to operations that are effectively removable without changing behaviour (i.e., potential dead code)."
