  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThis fragment can constitute dead code if the mhd_assert macro has no observable side effects in the deployed build (for example it expands to ((void)0) or to an expression that only reads connection->sk_corked). In that case the executed assertion does not affect program behaviour and its removal would not change the program \u2014 a dead-code situation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, on the other hand, mhd_assert performs an action with observable effect (logging, aborting on failure, etc.), then it is not dead code.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified post_send_setopt code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1812.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of post_send_setopt as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of post_send_setopt:\n```c\nstatic void\npost_send_setopt (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  bool plain_send_next,\n                  bool push_data)\n{\n  /* Try to buffer data if not sending the final piece.\n   * Final piece is indicated by push_data == true. */\n  const bool buffer_data = (! push_data);\n\n  if (_MHD_YES == connection->is_nonip)\n    return;\n  if (buffer_data)\n    return; /* Nothing to do after send(). */\n\n#ifndef MHD_USE_MSG_MORE\n  (void) plain_send_next; /* Mute compiler warning */\n#endif /* !
