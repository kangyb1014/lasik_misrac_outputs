  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function thoroughly. There are no calls to any of the string.h functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no occurrences of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar). The code only performs boolean checks, calls to connection-management helpers (e.g., MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_, zero_send_), preprocessor conditionals, and logging. There are no local buffer manipulations, string copies, or pointer arithmetic involving object bounds in this fragment that would risk accesses beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
