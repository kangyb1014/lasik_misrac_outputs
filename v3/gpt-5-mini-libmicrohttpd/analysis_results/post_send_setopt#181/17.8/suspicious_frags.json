  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any of the function parameters. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameter connection is used only for reading its fields and for passing to helper functions (e.g., MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_, zero_send_). The pointer variable itself is never assigned to or otherwise modified (no \"connection = ...\", no increments, no address-of taken to change it).\n- The non-pointer parameters plain_send_next and push_data are only read. plain_send_next is referenced (and explicitly cast to void in a compile-guarded section) and push_data is used only to compute the const bool buffer_data; neither is assigned to or modified.\n- Temporary variables (e.g., buffer_data, old_cork_state) are local and do not alter parameters.\n\nModifying the object referenced by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8; the code only modifies or queries the connection object via helper functions, which is permissible. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
