  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes are used (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __declspec, pragma GCC/clang extensions, inline assembler, etc.).\n- The adjacent string literals (SEC_AREA2_URL \"\" and the two HTML string literals separated across lines) rely on standard C concatenation and line-continuation behavior, not an extension.\n- The use of (void) to ignore a function result, static local variables, sizeof, enum return type, #if 0 / #endif and standard C comments are all standard C constructs, not extensions.\n- No implementation-defined or nonstandard preprocessing operators or token-pasting beyond normal macros are present.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you expect SEC_AREA2_URL to be a macro that expands to something compiler-specific, provide its definition so it can be checked."
