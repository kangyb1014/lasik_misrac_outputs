  "explanation": "Only calls to strcmp from <string.h> are present in the provided code; these comparisons must be investigated to ensure the objects pointed to (particularly 'url') are valid, null-terminated strings and that the macros SEC_AREA2_URL concatenations do not cause out-of-bounds reads. No other <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the snippet. The page_content length is computed using sizeof on a local static array (compile-time constant) and then used with MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, so that usage does not involve string.h functions and does not risk buffer overruns from string library calls. The header values are string literals and not manipulated with string.h routines. The second strcmp is inside #if 0 (disabled) but still present in the source and therefore included for inspection."
