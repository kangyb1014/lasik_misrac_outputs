Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of reply_with_area2_pages:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreply_with_area2_pages (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                        const char *url)\n{\n\n  if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA2_URL \"\"))\n  {\n    static const char page_content[] =\n      \"<html><head><title>Very restricted secret page</title></head>\" \\\n      \"<body>Welcome to the super restricted area</body></html>\";\n    static const size_t page_content_len =\n      (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n    struct MHD_Response *resp;\n    enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n    resp = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (page_content_len,\n                                                   page_content);\n    if (NULL == resp)\n      return MHD_NO;\n\n    /* Ignore possible error when adding the header as the reply will work even\n       without this header. */\n    (void) MHD_add_response_header (resp, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                    \"text/html\");\n\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (c, MHD_HTTP_OK, resp);\n    MHD_destroy_response (resp);\n    return ret;\n  }\n  /* If needed: add handlers for other URLs in this area */\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA2_URL \"other_path/other_page\"))\n  {\n    /* Add page creation/processing code */\n  }\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n\n  /* The requested URL is unknown */\n  return reply_with_page_not_found (c);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA2_URL \"\"))\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the if-condition (0 == strcmp(url, SEC_AREA2_URL \"\")) is an active runtime check that controls which response is sent. Removing it would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. The empty string literal concatenation is redundant but not executable dead code. (The disabled block under #if 0 is not compiled and thus not considered dead code per Note 2.)"
