  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp in the provided code. All string comparisons in this function use strcmp (two occurrences: the active if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA2_URL \"\")) and the same pattern inside the #if 0 disabled block). strcmp is the appropriate function for comparing null-terminated strings; MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids memcmp for this purpose, but memcmp does not appear anywhere in the snippet (nor via obvious macros). Other code (page_content length computation, MHD_* API calls, header addition) does not perform string comparisons with memcmp and therefore does not need investigation under this rule."
