  "scenario": "The if-block is wrapped in #if 0 ... #endif so it is removed by the preprocessor and not part of the translation unit; therefore it is not unreachable code at compile / run time and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Note: keeping disabled code in source is discouraged for maintainability \u2014 if the block were compiled but could never be executed (for example, placed after an unconditional return or guarded by a condition that is always false in the build), that would constitute a Rule 2.1 violation."
