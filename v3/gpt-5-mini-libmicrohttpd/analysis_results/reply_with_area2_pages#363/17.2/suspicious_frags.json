  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 17.2 violation to look for is any direct or indirect recursive call cycle involving reply_with_area2_pages. The fragments selected include the function header (to identify the function under analysis), the strcmp check (entry condition), all function calls made from inside reply_with_area2_pages (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) and the final call to reply_with_page_not_found. These calls must be investigated because any of them could, directly or indirectly (e.g. via callbacks or request-dispatch logic), call back into reply_with_area2_pages and create recursion. Other parts of the code do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the static page_content and page_content_len definitions are data only; local variable declarations and assignments (struct MHD_Response *resp; enum MHD_Result ret;) do not invoke functions; the conditional comment and disabled #if 0 block contain no active calls; and the final 'return ret;' inside the matching URL branch simply returns a local result and contains no further calls. None of those data/struct initializations or comments can by themselves create self/indirect calls, so they are not relevant to Rule 17.2."
