  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loop). Rationale: \n- First clause: \"i = 0\" sets the loop counter i \u2014 allowed (an expression that sets the loop counter). \n- Second clause: \"i < len\" is an expression that uses the loop counter and another object (len) that is not modified in the loop body; it has no persistent side effects. \n- Third clause: \"++i\" modifies only the loop counter i. \n- There is only one loop counter (i), and i is not modified in the loop body. The loop body only reads str1[i] and str2[i] into local const chars c1 and c2 and calls charsequalcaseless(c1, c2). The called function is passed copies of those char values, so it cannot directly modify the loop counter or len, and no object used in the second/third clause is modified in the body. \nGiven these points, the for statement is well-formed under Rule 14.2 and no code fragments require further investigation for this rule."
