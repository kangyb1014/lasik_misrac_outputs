  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragment does not call any functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), so Rule 21.17 \u2014 which applies to those string-handling library calls \u2014 is not triggered. Note: the code can still produce out-of-bounds accesses (and undefined behaviour) if either str1 or str2 refer to buffers shorter than len (e.g. len > actual buffer size), but that would violate general bounds-safety requirements, not Rule 21.17 specifically."
