  "scenario": "No \u2014 the fragment only declares the parameter as const char *const str2 and does not call any <string.h> functions. Rule 21.17 concerns the use of functions from <string.h>, so this declaration by itself does not violate the rule. (Note: the function body performs indexed reads str1[i]/str2[i]; if callers pass buffers shorter than len an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read would occur, but that is a general buffer-overrun issue rather than a direct violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 which targets use of <string.h> functions.)"
