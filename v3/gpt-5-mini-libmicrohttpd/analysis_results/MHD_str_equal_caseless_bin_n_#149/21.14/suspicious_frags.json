  "explanation": "The rule (21.14) specifically forbids using the standard library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp or any other C standard library string comparison function. It performs element\u2011by\u2011element comparison via charsequalcaseless over a supplied length (len), so it is a fixed\u2011length/binary style comparison rather than a null\u2011terminated string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 21.14.\n\nNote: the only called helper is charsequalcaseless; if that helper (not shown here) internally used memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, that implementation would need review. However, based solely on the presented code, no memcmp usage or null\u2011terminated string comparison is present and nothing else is relevant to Rule 21.14."
