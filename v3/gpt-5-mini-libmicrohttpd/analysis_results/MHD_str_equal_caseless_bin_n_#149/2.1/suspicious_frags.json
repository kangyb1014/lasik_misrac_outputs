  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified. Reasoning:\n- All variable declarations (i, c1, c2) are reachable when the function is called.\n- The for-loop body is reachable for any len > 0; if len == 0 the loop is skipped and the final return is executed (this is intended behavior, not unreachable code).\n- The if branch (charsequalcaseless(c1, c2)) leading to continue is reachable when characters compare equal; the else branch returning 0 is reachable when they do not. Neither branch contains statements that can never be executed.\n- The final return (! 0) is reachable when the loop completes (all compared characters matched) or when len is zero.\n- There are no unconditional jumps, infinite loops, or code occurring after an unconditional return within the same block that would render any following statements unreachable.\nTherefore, no code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in the provided function."
