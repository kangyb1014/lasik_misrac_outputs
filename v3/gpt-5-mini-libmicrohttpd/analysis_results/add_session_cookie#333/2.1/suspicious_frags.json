  "explanation": "I marked the whole function and specifically the error-handling branch as suspicious for reachability analysis because: (a) The function is declared static \u2014 if it is not referenced anywhere else in the translation unit it is dead/unreachable code at link/runtime and should be investigated. (b) The error branch (fprintf) depends on the return value of MHD_add_response_header; if that API is guaranteed (by its implementation or build configuration) to always succeed or be a macro that never yields MHD_NO, the branch would be unreachable and needs review.\n\nOther fragments do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code):\n- The local buffer declaration (char cstr[256];) and the snprintf call are ordinary reachable statements executed whenever the function is called; there is no code-after-return or other construct making them unreachable within this function.\n- The string formatting arguments (\"%s=%s\", COOKIE_NAME, session->sid) are runtime inputs/macros and do not create compile-time-constant branches that would render code unreachable.\n- There are no return statements, goto labels, switch-case constructs, or conditional constants in this snippet that would produce obviously unreachable statements elsewhere in the function.\n\nTherefore the only parts warranting reachability investigation based on the provided code are the entire static function (to determine if it is ever called) and the conditional error branch (to determine if that branch can actually be taken)."
