  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameter 'struct Session *session' and the uses of the session data and the buffer passed to the header API because they involve pointer types that could plausibly be const-qualified and therefore warrant inspection for Rule 8.13. Other fragments were not flagged for these reasons: \n- The 'response' parameter is used to modify the response via MHD_add_response_header, so it is expected to be non-const. \n- The local buffer declaration 'char cstr[256];' is a mutable array used to build the cookie string; it should remain non-const. \n- The format string and COOKIE_NAME are string literals/macros (implicitly const), and their usage with snprintf is read-only. \n- Calls to fprintf and the MHD_NO comparison do not involve pointer types that could be made const in this function. \nI reviewed the snippet to ensure all pointer-related sites that could be made const were reported."
