Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_session_cookie:\n```c\nstatic void\nadd_session_cookie (struct Session *session,\n                    struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  char cstr[256];\n  snprintf (cstr,\n            sizeof (cstr),\n            \"%s=%s\",\n            COOKIE_NAME,\n            session->sid);\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,\n                               cstr))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set session cookie header!\\n\");\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nchar cstr[256];\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The local array cstr is used as the destination buffer for snprintf and then passed to MHD_add_response_header to form the Set-Cookie header. Removing the declaration (and hence the buffer) would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. If instead cstr were declared but never referenced (or its writes had no effect on observable behaviour), that would be a violation, but that is not the case here."
