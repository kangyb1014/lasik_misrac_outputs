  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_session_cookie:\n```c\nstatic void\nadd_session_cookie (struct Session *session,\n                    struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  char cstr[256];\n  snprintf (cstr,\n            sizeof (cstr),\n            \"%s=%s\",\n            COOKIE_NAME,\n            session->sid);\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,\n                               cstr))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set session cookie header!\\n\");\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,\n                               cstr))\n  {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the conditional checks the runtime return value of MHD_add_response_header and prints an error if MHD_NO is returned. Removing the if (and the fprintf) would change program behaviour (loss of error reporting), so this is not dead code. Note: only if it could be proven that MHD_add_response_header never returns MHD_NO (making the branch provably unreachable) would the if-block be redundant; absent such a proof, Rule 2.2 is not violated."
