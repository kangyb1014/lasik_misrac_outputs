  "explanation": "Only the two calls to memcpy are potentially problematic under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they read from the source pointers (header, content) without any verification that those objects are at least header_len/content_len bytes long or non-NULL. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for this rule: the destinations are allocated with malloc(header_len + 1) and malloc(content_len + 1) and checked for NULL before use, and the null-terminator assignments write within the allocated bounds. No other <string.h> functions are used in this function, and the remaining calls (malloc, free, the mhd_assert checks, and the call to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_) are not string-handling operations subject to Rule 21.17 in this context."
