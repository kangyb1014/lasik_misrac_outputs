  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment declares a function returning 'struct MHD_Response *' (a pointer to a non-const object). This is not necessarily a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: it is only a violation if the function actually returns a pointer to an object that should not be modified by the caller (for example an internal static or read\u2011only object). In that case the correct signature would be 'const struct MHD_Response *' and the current declaration would violate Rule 8.13. With the fragment alone (no information whether the returned object is meant to be mutable), we cannot conclude a definite violation."
