  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_data:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_data (size_t size,\n                               void *data,\n                               int must_free,\n                               int must_copy)\n{\n  enum MHD_ResponseMemoryMode mode;\n\n  if (0 != must_copy)\n    mode = MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY;\n  else if (0 != must_free)\n    mode = MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE;\n  else\n    mode = MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT;\n\n  return MHD_create_response_from_buffer (size, data, mode);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nenum MHD_ResponseMemoryMode mode;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local variable 'mode' is assigned in the if/else chain (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY, MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE or MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT) and then passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer. Removing the declaration (or the subsequent assignments) would change program behaviour or fail to compile, so it is not dead code."
