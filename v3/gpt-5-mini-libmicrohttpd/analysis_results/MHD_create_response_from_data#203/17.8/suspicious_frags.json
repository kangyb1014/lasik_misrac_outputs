  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters (size, data, must_free, must_copy) are only read; must_free and must_copy are tested but never assigned to, and data (the pointer parameter) is not reassigned or altered \u2014 it is passed unchanged to MHD_create_response_from_buffer. The code uses a local enum variable 'mode' to hold derived state. There are no pointer dereferences that modify the pointed-to object, nor any assignments or increments to the parameter variables themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
