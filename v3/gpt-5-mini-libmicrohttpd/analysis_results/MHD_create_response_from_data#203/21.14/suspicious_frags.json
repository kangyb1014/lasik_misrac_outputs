  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body and found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp, no inclusion of string.h, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The code only tests integer flags (must_copy, must_free), assigns an enum value, and forwards the size/data/mode to MHD_create_response_from_buffer. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that violate Rule 21.14. Note: the callee MHD_create_response_from_buffer is not shown here; if you need a full Rule 21.14 check, that function (and any other functions that handle or compare strings) should be inspected for memcmp usage comparing null-terminated strings."
