  "explanation": "Only the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer is potentially relevant to Rule 17.2 because the rule prohibits direct or indirect self-calls. The other lines (parameter declarations, enum variable, and assignments to mode) contain no function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion by themselves. To determine compliance, reviewers need to inspect the implementation of MHD_create_response_from_buffer (and any functions it calls) to ensure there is no path that leads back to MHD_create_response_from_data. No other fragments in this function can cause self-call behavior."
