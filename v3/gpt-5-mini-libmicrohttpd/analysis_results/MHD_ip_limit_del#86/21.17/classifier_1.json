  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. The call to MHD_ip_addr_to_key is not itself a string.h function, so Rule 21.17 is not directly triggered by this line. A violation could occur if MHD_ip_addr_to_key internally uses memcpy/memmove/strncpy/etc. and copies/reads addrlen bytes without ensuring addr actually refers to an object at least addrlen bytes long (for example, if addrlen > sizeof *addr or > the actual address structure length for the address family). To avoid a real violation either (a) the caller must ensure addrlen is no greater than the size of the referenced object (and appropriate family-specific lengths), or (b) MHD_ip_addr_to_key must validate addrlen and perform bounded copies/reads (e.g. using a checked memcpy or limiting the number of bytes copied)."
