  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that can access beyond object bounds. In this snippet there are no direct calls to any <string.h> routines, nor any raw buffer manipulations or pointer arithmetic in this function body that would itself violate the rule. The only places that could involve string.h functions are calls to other functions whose implementations are not shown here. Specifically, MHD_ip_addr_to_key likely constructs a key from an address and MHD_ip_addr_compare (used via tfind/tdelete) may compare address/key memory; those implementations could use memcpy/memcmp/strcpy/etc. and therefore should be inspected. The rest of the code (daemon = MHD_get_master(...); lock/unlock calls; node pointer handling; decrementing/freeing found_key; MHD_PANIC) do not invoke string.h functions and contain no buffer operations relevant to Rule 21.17, so they do not need further investigation for this rule in this fragment."
