  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment found_key = (struct MHD_IPCount *) *nodep; is reached only when tfind(...) returned non-NULL (the preceding if returns/panics on NULL), so it is not unreachable. The surrounding control flow guarantees this statement can be executed. (Note: if MHD_PANIC were a noreturn call that unconditionally executed, code after it could be unreachable, but here that call is inside the NULL branch and does not make this assignment unreachable.)"
