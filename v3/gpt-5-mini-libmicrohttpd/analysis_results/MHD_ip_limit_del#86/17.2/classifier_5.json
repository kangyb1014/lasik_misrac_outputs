  "scenario": "The call to MHD_get_master(daemon) in MHD_ip_limit_del does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Rule 17.2 forbids a function calling itself (directly or indirectly). Calling a different function (MHD_get_master) is acceptable provided that MHD_get_master does not, directly or indirectly, call MHD_ip_limit_del. There is no evidence in the provided fragment that MHD_get_master calls MHD_ip_limit_del, so no violation is present. (Hypothetical violation scenario: if MHD_get_master directly called MHD_ip_limit_del, or called another function chain that led back to MHD_ip_limit_del, that would create an indirect recursion and violate Rule 17.2.)"
