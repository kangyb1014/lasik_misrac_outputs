  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment: it simply calls MHD_PANIC(_(\"...\")); there is no evidence that MHD_PANIC or the translation macro '_' calls MHD_ip_limit_del (directly or indirectly). A 17.2 violation would occur only if MHD_PANIC (or _) invoked a handler that ultimately called MHD_ip_limit_del (for example, if the panic handler triggered cleanup callbacks that re-entered MHD_ip_limit_del), but nothing in the fragment shows that."
