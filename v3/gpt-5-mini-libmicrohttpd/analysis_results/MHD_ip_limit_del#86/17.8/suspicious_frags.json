  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not modify function parameters and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 17.8: - The function parameters are declared but not otherwise assigned to (addrlen is not modified). - addr is a pointer to const data and is only passed to MHD_ip_addr_to_key; the pointer itself is not assigned to. - Operations that modify objects via pointers (e.g. --found_key->count, free(found_key)) modify pointees, not function parameters; such modifications are allowed by the rule. - Local variables and local objects (search_key, found_key, nodep) are used and modified locally. - Calls to tfind, tdelete, MHD_ip_count_lock/unlock and other functions pass parameters but do not assign to this function's parameter variables. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for parameter modification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
