  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where appropriate or require non-const pointers due to observable modification of the pointed-to object or API constraints. Specifically:\n- The parameter \"const struct sockaddr_storage *addr\" is already const-qualified.\n- The local object \"struct MHD_IPCount search_key;\" is written to (initialized) by MHD_ip_addr_to_key, so it must be non-const.\n- The function parameter \"struct MHD_Daemon *daemon\" is used to modify daemon state (locks, per_ip_connection_count manipulation), so it cannot be const.\n- The code decrements and may free the object referenced by found_key (found_key->count and free(found_key)), so that pointer must refer to a modifiable object (non-const).\n- The use of tfind/tdelete follows the (non-const) tree-search API semantics: the root/pointer types and returned pointer-to-pointer are tied to that API, and the code both reads and removes nodes; these usages may legitimately require non-const pointer types.\n- Calls that pass string literals to diagnostic macros (MHD_PANIC/_) involve string literal types and are not a Rule 8.13 concern in the shown code.\nGiven the above, only the listed fragments (pointer declarations, the tfind assignment, the cast from the tfind result, and the tdelete call) warrant investigation to ensure pointers are const-qualified where possible and consistent with the used APIs."
