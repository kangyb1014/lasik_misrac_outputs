Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_limit_del:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_limit_del (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                  const struct sockaddr_storage *addr,\n                  socklen_t addrlen)\n{\n  struct MHD_IPCount search_key;\n  struct MHD_IPCount *found_key;\n  void **nodep;\n\n  daemon = MHD_get_master (daemon);\n  /* Ignore if no connection limit assigned */\n  if (0 == daemon->per_ip_connection_limit)\n    return;\n  /* Initialize search key */\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_ip_addr_to_key (addr,\n                                    addrlen,\n                                    &search_key))\n    return;\n\n  MHD_ip_count_lock (daemon);\n\n  /* Search for the IP address */\n  if (NULL == (nodep = tfind (&search_key,\n                              &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n                              &MHD_ip_addr_compare)))\n  {\n    /* Something's wrong if we couldn't find an IP address\n     * that was previously added */\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to find previously-added IP address.\\n\"));\n  }\n  found_key = (struct MHD_IPCount *) *nodep;\n  /* Validate existing count for IP address */\n  if (0 == found_key->count)\n  {\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Previously-added IP address had counter of zero.\\n\"));\n  }\n  /* Remove the node entirely if count reduces to 0 */\n  if (0 == --found_key->count)\n  {\n    tdelete (found_key,\n             &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n             &MHD_ip_addr_compare);\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n    free (found_key);\n  }\n  else\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndaemon = MHD_get_master (daemon);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment daemon = MHD_get_master(daemon) is used: subsequent accesses (daemon->per_ip_connection_limit, per_ip_connection_count, locks, etc.) must operate on the master daemon. Removing the call/assignment could change behaviour when a non\u2011master daemon is passed (or if MHD_get_master has side\u2011effects), so the operation is not dead code."
