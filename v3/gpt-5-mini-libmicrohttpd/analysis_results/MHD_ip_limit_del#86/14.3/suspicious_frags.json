  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are manifestly invariant. Each conditional depends on runtime values or function results:\n- if (0 == daemon->per_ip_connection_limit) uses a field of daemon obtained at runtime (daemon = MHD_get_master(daemon)).\n- if (MHD_NO == MHD_ip_addr_to_key(...)) depends on the runtime return of MHD_ip_addr_to_key.\n- if (NULL == (nodep = tfind(...))) depends on the runtime return of tfind (and includes an assignment of that runtime value).\n- if (0 == found_key->count) depends on the runtime value of found_key->count.\n- if (0 == --found_key->count) depends on the runtime value after a runtime decrement.\n\nNone of these are constant expressions or compile-time invariants; the allowed exceptions (infinite loops or the specified do-while case) do not apply because there are no loops with constant controlling expressions in this code. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
