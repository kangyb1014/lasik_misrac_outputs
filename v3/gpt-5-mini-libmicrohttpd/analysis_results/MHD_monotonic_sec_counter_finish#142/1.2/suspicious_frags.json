  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: a function definition, preprocessor conditional compilation (#ifdef / #endif), macro identifiers, and ordinary function calls. There are no occurrences of compiler-specific extension syntax such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, nested functions, inline assembly (asm/__asm__), statement-expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, vector extensions, or other vendor-specific tokens that compilers document as extensions. The use of OS/SDK APIs (mach_port_deallocate, mach_task_self) and project macros/macros with leading underscores are not compiler language extensions per se, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2 under the requirement to report only documented compiler language extensions."
