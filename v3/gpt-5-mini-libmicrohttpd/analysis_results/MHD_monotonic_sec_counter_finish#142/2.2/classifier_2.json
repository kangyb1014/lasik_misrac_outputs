  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME\n  if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n  {\n    mach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n    mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), mono_clock_service) performs a resource release (deallocating a Mach port); removing it would change program behaviour (resource usage, lifetime and possibly timing), so it is not dead code. (A violation would only occur if the call is guaranteed never to be executed in any build or if mach_port_deallocate is a no-op/macro-expands-to-nothing in the build \u2014 in that specific case the operation would be dead.)"
