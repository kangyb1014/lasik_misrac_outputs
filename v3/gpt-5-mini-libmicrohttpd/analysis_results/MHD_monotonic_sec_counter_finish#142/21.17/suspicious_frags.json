  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and ensuring they do not access beyond object bounds. The provided function contains only a compile-time conditional, a comparison of mono_clock_service against _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV, a call to mach_port_deallocate, and an assignment to mono_clock_service. There are no calls to any <string.h> functions, no operations on character buffers, no pointer arithmetic on char arrays, and no use of standard string/ memory routines that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
