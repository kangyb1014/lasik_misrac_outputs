  "scenario": "Not enough context to prove this assignment is required. The assignment r->data_buffer_size = size is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 only if that field is never read anywhere else. Example violating scenario: the struct member data_buffer_size is only written here and never subsequently read/used by any function (no observable effect), so removing the assignment would not change program behaviour \u2014 that makes it dead code and thus a Rule 2.2 violation. If, however, other code depends on r->data_buffer_size being initialized to size, then the assignment is not dead and Rule 2.2 is not violated. Based on the fragment alone the rule cannot be conclusively shown violated."
