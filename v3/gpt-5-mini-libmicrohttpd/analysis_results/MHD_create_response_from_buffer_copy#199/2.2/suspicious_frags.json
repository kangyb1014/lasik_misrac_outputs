  "explanation": "The remaining lines (variable declarations, the final \"return r;\", and the general control flow) implement necessary control, resource allocation and error handling and therefore should not be treated as dead code: the malloc + NULL-check sequence prevents dereferencing a NULL pointer and handles allocation failure; memcpy copies user data into owned storage; freeing mhd_copy when r is NULL prevents a leak; the early returns avoid undefined behavior for special inputs. The listed fragments are those that appear potentially redundant, unreachable in practice, or flagged by an in-source TODO and therefore warrant further investigation for possible dead/redundant code under MISRA C Rule 2.2. No other code fragments were omitted because they are clearly part of required error handling or resource management and removal would change program behaviour."
