Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy (size_t size,\n                                      const void *buffer)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  void *mhd_copy;\n\n  if (0 == size)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (0,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL);\n  if (NULL == buffer)\n    return NULL;\n\n  mhd_copy = malloc (size);\n  if (NULL == mhd_copy)\n    return NULL;\n  memcpy (mhd_copy, buffer, size);\n\n  r = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                              mhd_copy,\n                                                              &free,\n                                                              mhd_copy);\n  if (NULL == r)\n    free (mhd_copy);\n  else\n  {\n    /* TODO: remove the next assignment, the buffer should not be modifiable */\n    r->data_buffer_size = size;\n  }\n\n  return r;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemcpy (mhd_copy, buffer, size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The memcpy(mhd_copy, buffer, size) copies the caller's data into the newly allocated mhd_copy which is then passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls as the response payload (and later freed on failure). Removing this call would change the response buffer contents (and therefore program behaviour). Note also that the memcpy only executes when size>0, buffer!=NULL and malloc succeeded (other paths return earlier)."
