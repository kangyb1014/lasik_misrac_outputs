  "explanation": "Fragments not listed (variable declarations, the final \"return r;\" and simple assignments) are straightforward and do not contain conditional constructs or calls whose behavior could render subsequent statements unreachable. The selected fragments cover all conditional branches and calls to external functions or allocation routines where reachability depends on runtime conditions (size value, buffer pointer, malloc success, and the return value of the external MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls). These are the points that must be investigated to determine whether any code paths are actually unreachable; other parts of the function do not present reachability concerns and therefore do not need investigation."
