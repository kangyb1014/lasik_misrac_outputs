  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they do not present obvious pointer-to-non-const issues relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already declared as const (const void *buffer) so it conforms to the rule at the call site; early-return checks (if (0 == size), if (NULL == buffer), NULL checks on malloc) and the free() call placement are control-flow/error-handling and not pointer-qualification issues; the function return type and local variable 'r' are structures/pointers to mutable response objects where non-const is expected; the use of memcpy and malloc themselves are fine per se, but the destinations/usages of the allocated buffer (declared above) are the primary places where const-qualification should be reviewed \u2014 those are included in the suspicious fragments. No other pointer declarations or uses in the shown code suggest a missing const qualification."
