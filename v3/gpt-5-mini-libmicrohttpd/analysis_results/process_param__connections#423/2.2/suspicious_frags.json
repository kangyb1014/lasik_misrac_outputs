  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (function signature, braces, local variable declarations, and any simple syntactic elements not listed above) are necessary for well-formed compilation and participate in control/data flow: parameters are present and referenced, declarations provide storage, and the function must return a result. There are no other obvious unreachable branches or redundant statements outside the listed fragments. The items not selected directly contribute to program behaviour or are structural, so they do not require further investigation for dead-code under Rule 2.2 without broader context."
