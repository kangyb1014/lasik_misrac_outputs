  "explanation": "No other lines in this function invoke standard <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The remaining code consists of variable declarations, integer comparison, assignment to tool_params.connections, and return statements, none of which directly call or imply use of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so they do not need investigation for this specific rule."
