  "explanation": "No calls to the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the code fragment. The only string-related call is strerror(errno) passed to fprintf; strerror does not take a user-supplied buffer pointer (it returns a pointer to static or thread-local storage) and therefore does not create a potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds access of an object referenced by a pointer parameter as described by Rule 21.17. Other calls (sigemptyset, sigaction, assignments to sig fields) are unrelated to <string.h> string\u2011handling functions. Consequently there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 21.17."
