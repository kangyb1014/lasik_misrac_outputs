  "explanation": "I selected all occurrences in the function that involve pointers or pointer-returning functions which could be relevant to Rule 8.13. Other parts of the code do not need investigation for this rule: - The local declarations (\"struct sigaction oldsig;\" and \"struct sigaction sig;\") are plain objects, not pointer declarations. - The use of &oldsig in the sigaction call is for an output parameter (old action) and must be non-const because sigaction writes to it. - The address of sig.sa_mask is passed to sigemptyset which modifies the mask, so that pointer cannot/should not be const. - The conditional compilation and assignments to sig.sa_flags are integer manipulations, not pointer issues. No other pointer usages appear in the function."
