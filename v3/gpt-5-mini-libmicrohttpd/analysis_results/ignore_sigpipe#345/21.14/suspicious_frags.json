  "explanation": "No use of memcmp (or any indirect macro-wrapped call to memcmp) appears in the provided code. The function ignore_sigpipe only performs signal setup (sigaction, sigemptyset), assigns a function pointer to sig.sa_handler, sets flags via macros (SA_INTERRUPT/SA_RESTART), and calls fprintf with strerror(errno) to print an error message. There are no string comparisons, no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and no other routine that implies such a comparison. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
