  ],
  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are limited to variable declarations (struct sigaction oldsig; struct sigaction sig;), simple assignments to sig.sa_flags inside the #ifdef/#else block, and the preprocessor conditional itself. These are not function calls and therefore cannot by themselves produce direct or indirect calls back into ignore_sigpipe. The listed fragments include all function calls and the assignment of the signal handler pointer; those are the only places where indirect or callback-based invocation paths that could lead to recursion need further investigation."
