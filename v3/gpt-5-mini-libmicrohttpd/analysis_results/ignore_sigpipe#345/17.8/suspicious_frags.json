  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters. The function ignore_sigpipe has no parameters. All variables used (sig and oldsig) are local objects; assignments (sig.sa_handler = &catcher; sig.sa_flags = ...) modify members of a local struct, not parameters. Calls sigemptyset(&sig.sa_mask) and sigaction(SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig) pass addresses of local objects \u2014 the rule explicitly allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter (it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself). No function parameter is modified in this code, so there are no fragments that need investigation under Rule 17.8."
