  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were considered not suspicious for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 for the following reasons.\n\n- The local declaration 'struct sigaction sig;' is used to prepare the action passed to sigaction; it is not dead since its fields are set and the structure is passed to the system call.\n\n- The call to sigemptyset(&sig.sa_mask) is a meaningful initialization of the signal mask that is used by sigaction and is not dead.\n\n- The conditional assignment of sig.sa_flags via the #ifdef/#else selects a platform-appropriate flag at compile time; the unselected branch is not part of the compiled translation unit (so it is not executed dead code) and the selected assignment has observable effect on signal semantics.\n\n- The fprintf(...) invocation in the error path is an observable side effect used for diagnostics and therefore is not dead.\n\n- Using '&catcher' to initialize sig.sa_handler is a legitimate function pointer assignment (equivalent to 'catcher') that affects runtime signal handling, so it is not dead.\n\n- Preprocessor-controlled branches that are not compiled do not constitute executed dead code in the build; only code present in the translation unit after preprocessing can be considered for Rule 2.2.\n\nI have therefore reported the function (static linkage may make it unused in the translation unit), the unused-oldsig pattern (oldsig is written by sigaction but never read), and the sigaction invocation that writes oldsig as suspicious and worthy of further investigation."
