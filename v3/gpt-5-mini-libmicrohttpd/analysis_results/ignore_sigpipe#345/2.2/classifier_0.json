  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ignore_sigpipe:\n```c\nstatic void\nignore_sigpipe (void)\n{\n  struct sigaction oldsig;\n  struct sigaction sig;\n\n  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;\n  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);\n#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */\n#else\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;\n#endif\n  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct sigaction oldsig;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The local variable 'oldsig' is declared and passed to sigaction(&oldsig) solely to receive the previous SIGPIPE handler but its contents are never read or used afterwards. The write into this object (performed by sigaction) and the allocation of the variable could be removed (pass NULL to sigaction) without changing program behaviour, so this is dead code."
