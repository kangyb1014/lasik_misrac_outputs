  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ignore_sigpipe:\n```c\nstatic void\nignore_sigpipe (void)\n{\n  struct sigaction oldsig;\n  struct sigaction sig;\n\n  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;\n  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);\n#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */\n#else\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;\n#endif\n  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fprintf call is executed when sigaction() fails (returns non-zero); for example, if sigaction returns -1 and errno is set, the fprintf prints \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: ...\". Removing that fprintf would change observable program behaviour (loss of the error diagnostic), so this is not dead code."
