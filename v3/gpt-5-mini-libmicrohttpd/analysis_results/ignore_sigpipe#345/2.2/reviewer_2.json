  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following ignore_sigpipe code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of ignore_sigpipe.\n```c\nstatic void\nignore_sigpipe (void)\n{\n  struct sigaction oldsig;\n  struct sigaction sig;\n\n  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;\n  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);\n#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */\n#else\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;\n#endif\n  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false).

The write into 'oldsig' (and the declaration) is an operation whose removal (passing NULL instead) would not affect program behaviour, so this constitutes dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The local variable 'oldsig' is written by sigaction when its address is passed, but the stored value is never read or used afterwards. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. Removing the write (e.g. by passing NULL as the third argument to sigaction) would not change observable program behaviour, so the declaration and the write into 'oldsig' constitute dead code. The proper fix is to omit the unused variable and pass NULL if the previous action is not required."
