  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any other Standard Library function for comparing strings are present in the provided code fragment. The function only: checks a boolean flag (tool_params.all_cpus), calls get_process_cpu_core_count(), calls printf(), calls get_cpu_core_count(), assigns/compares integer values, and calls print_all_cores_used(). None of these statements perform a memory comparison of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If concerns exist about the implementations of the called functions, those function bodies would need to be examined separately, but they are outside the supplied fragment.)"
