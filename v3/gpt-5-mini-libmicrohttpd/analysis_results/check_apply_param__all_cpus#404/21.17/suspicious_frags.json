  "explanation": "No use of <string.h> functions appears in this function. The code only tests a boolean flag (tool_params.all_cpus), assigns num_threads from get_process_cpu_core_count(), calls printf with a string literal, compares integer counts from get_cpu_core_count(), and calls print_all_cores_used(). There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string.h routine in the presented fragment, nor any explicit pointer arithmetic or buffer accesses that could cause out-of-bounds string handling. Any string handling that might occur inside the called functions is outside the scope of this fragment and cannot be analyzed here; therefore no fragments in this function require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
