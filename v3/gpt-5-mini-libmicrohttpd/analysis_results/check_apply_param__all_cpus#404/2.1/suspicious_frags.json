  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function is statically unreachable. Explanation by fragment:\n- if (! tool_params.all_cpus) return; \u2014 This is a conditional return; the return statement is executed only when tool_params.all_cpus is false, so the subsequent statements are reachable when tool_params.all_cpus is true.\n- num_threads = get_process_cpu_core_count (); \u2014 Executed whenever tool_params.all_cpus is true; not inherently unreachable.\n- printf (\"Requested use of all available CPU cores for MHD threads.\\n\"); \u2014 Executed after the assignment above; reachable under the same condition.\n- if (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads) print_all_cores_used (); \u2014 Conditional runtime check; its body is reachable when the condition is true.\n\nThere are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, or constructs that make following code impossible to reach in all executions. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided code alone. (If global/static analysis outside this function later reveals that tool_params.all_cpus is a compile-time constant making branches impossible, that would be outside the scope of this single-function inspection.)"
