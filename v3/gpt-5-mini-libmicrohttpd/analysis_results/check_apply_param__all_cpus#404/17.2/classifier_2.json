  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation based on the provided code. The fragment shows check_apply_param__all_cpus calling print_all_cores_used(), which is a different function; there is no evidence here that print_all_cores_used calls check_apply_param__all_cpus (directly or indirectly). If, elsewhere in the code, print_all_cores_used (or a function it calls) calls check_apply_param__all_cpus then an indirect recursion would occur and Rule 17.2 would be violated."
