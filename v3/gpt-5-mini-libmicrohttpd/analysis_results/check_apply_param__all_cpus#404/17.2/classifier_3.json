  "scenario": "The fragment calls get_process_cpu_core_count() from within check_apply_param__all_cpus. This is a call to a different function and is not a direct self-call. There is no evidence in the provided code of indirect recursion either. It would only violate MISRA 17.2 if get_process_cpu_core_count (or a callee chain) eventually called check_apply_param__all_cpus, which is not shown here."
