  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_param__all_cpus:\n```c\nstatic void\ncheck_apply_param__all_cpus (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.all_cpus)\n    return;\n\n  num_threads = get_process_cpu_core_count ();\n  printf (\"Requested use of all available CPU cores for MHD threads.\\n\");\n  if (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads)\n    print_all_cores_used ();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads)\n    print_all_cores_used ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "When tool_params.all_cpus is true and get_cpu_core_count() == num_threads (i.e. the requested number of threads equals the actual CPU core count), the call print_all_cores_used() is executed and produces observable behaviour (output and timing). Removing this call would change program behaviour, so the fragment is not dead code."
