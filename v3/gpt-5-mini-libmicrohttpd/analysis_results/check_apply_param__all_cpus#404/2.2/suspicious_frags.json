Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have not flagged the function declaration/closing brace or the early guard (if (! tool_params.all_cpus) return;) because these are structural or control-flow elements whose removal or alteration clearly changes when the body executes. The function signature and braces are syntactic and not candidates for \"dead code\" on their own. The early guard is an explicit runtime check that prevents the body from executing; it cannot be classified as dead without whole-program knowledge that tool_params.all_cpus is statically constant (which requires broader analysis). No other executable statements exist in the snippet beyond the three fragments listed, so there are no additional places in this function that warrant investigation for possible dead code."
