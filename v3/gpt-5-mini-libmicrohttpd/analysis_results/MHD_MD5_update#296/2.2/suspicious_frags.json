  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs are functional operations whose removal would change the observable behaviour of the function (or are conditionally executed and required for correct processing):\n- bytes_have initialization and its subsequent use (computing the buffer offset) is required for correct accumulation of partial blocks.\n- The branching that fills the buffer, the memcpy calls that copy input into the buffer, and the md5_transform calls (both in the combined-block branch and the while loop) perform the algorithm\u2019s core work; removing them would alter the digest result or timing.\n- The while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length) loop and the final if (0 != length) memcpy are active code paths used to process full and partial blocks; they are not redundant.\n- Variable declarations, casts and comments are not executable operations that could constitute dead code in this context.\nTherefore those parts do not need further investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
