The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_MD5_update:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_MD5_update (struct Md5Ctx *ctx,\n                const uint8_t *data,\n                size_t length)\n{\n  unsigned int bytes_have; /**< Number of bytes in the context buffer */\n\n  mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0));\n\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  if (0 == length)\n    return; /* Shortcut, do nothing */\n#endif /* MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE */\n\n  /* Note: (count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1))\n           equals (count % MD5_BLOCK_SIZE) for this block size. */\n  bytes_have = (unsigned int) (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1));\n  ctx->count += length;\n\n  if (0 != bytes_have)\n  {\n    unsigned int bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have;\n    if (length >= bytes_left)\n    {     /* Combine new data with data in the buffer and\n             process the full block. */\n      memcpy (((uint8_t *) ctx->buffer) + bytes_have,\n              data,\n              bytes_left);\n      data += bytes_left;\n      length -= bytes_left;\n      md5_transform (ctx->H, ctx->buffer);\n      bytes_have = 0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length)\n  {   /* Process any full blocks of new data directly,\n         without copying to the buffer. */\n    md5_transform (ctx->H, data);\n    data += MD5_BLOCK_SIZE;\n    length -= MD5_BLOCK_SIZE;\n  }\n\n  if (0 != length)\n  {   /* Copy incomplete block of new data (if any)\n         to the buffer. */\n    memcpy (((uint8_t *) ctx->buffer) + bytes_have, data, length);\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  if (0 == length)\n    return; /* Shortcut, do nothing */\n#endif /* MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The early-return shortcut is not dead code: it is conditionally compiled and only executed when length == 0. Removing it would change control flow and execution time (the function would fall through and execute extra computations even though they do not change state), and in embedded systems timing can be part of observable behaviour (see MISRA note 1). Therefore this operation is not guaranteed to be removable without affecting program behaviour and does not violate Rule 2.2."
