  "explanation": "The only uses of functions from <string.h> in this function are the two memcpy calls shown above; these are therefore the only places that can potentially produce out-of-bounds accesses per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Other code fragments do not call <string.h> functions and thus cannot violate this rule: - The mhd_assert and the early return handle the case of a NULL data pointer or zero length (data must be non-NULL when a non-zero copy occurs). - The calculation bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have and the conditional checks (length >= bytes_left) ensure the first memcpy only occurs when length is sufficient to copy bytes_left. - The logic that sets bytes_have to 0 after forming a full block and the checks before the final memcpy ensure that the final copy only occurs with bytes_have + length < MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (i.e. it copies an incomplete block into the buffer). - md5_transform and the loop that processes whole blocks do not use <string.h> functions and are out of scope for Rule 21.17. Therefore only the two memcpy calls need to be investigated for potential out-of-bounds behavior."
