True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe cast-to-void statement `(void) cls;` is an executed, effect-free operation whose removal would not change program behaviour. It merely silences a compiler warning about an unused parameter and has no runtime effect, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. A compliant alternative is to omit the parameter name in the function signature or use a standardized mechanism to mark the parameter as intentionally unused (e.g. a compiler attribute), rather than leaving an effect-free expression statement.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The four lines\n  (void) cls;\n  (void) version;\n  (void) upload_data;\n  (void) upload_data_size;\nare expression statements that are executed but have no effect on the observable behaviour of the program; removing them would not change program semantics. That matches the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the code as written violates that rule.\n\n(Notes: the Rule 2.2 exception for unreachable code does not apply here because these statements are reachable and executed. The Rule 2.2 note about timing means one must consider whether an otherwise effect\u2011free operation is relied on for timing \u2014 in this case these simple cast-to-void expressions do not provide meaningful timing behaviour and are normally emitted as no code by compilers, so that exception does not rescue them.)\n\nRecommended remedies: remove those effect\u2011free statements and either omit the parameter names in the function definition for parameters that are intentionally unused (e.g. leave the parameter name out in the function definition) or mark the parameters as intentionally unused using a documented, tool-supported mechanism (for example a standard project-wide UNUSED(x) macro that expands to a compiler-supported attribute, or using a portable attribute if your toolchain supports it). If a project decides to keep the (void) cast idiom, that should be recorded as a formal deviation from Rule 2.2 with justification."
