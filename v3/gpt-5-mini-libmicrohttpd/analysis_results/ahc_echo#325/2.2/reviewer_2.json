Removing this statement would not change the program's behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The explicit (void) version; statement is the standard idiom to mark a parameter as deliberately unused and to silence compiler warnings; it is an intentional, side\u2011effect\u2011free use of the parameter rather than an accidental, unneeded operation. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. While removing the cast-to-void would not change the runtime semantics in this case, the statement serves as an explicit use of the parameter (and is the accepted way to document/avoid an unused-parameter diagnostic). In practice MISRA accepts such idioms for declaring parameters unused rather than treating them as fatal \u201cdead code.\u201d Therefore the claim that this line violates Rule 2.2 is not correct."
