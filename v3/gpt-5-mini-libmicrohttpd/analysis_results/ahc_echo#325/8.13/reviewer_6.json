The parameter 'void **req_cls' is intentionally non-const because the callback updates *req_cls, so it must remain mutable.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 asks that pointers should point to const-qualified types when that is possible. However ahc_echo is implementing a callback with a library-defined prototype (the libmicrohttpd access-handler callback), so its parameter types must match the external API. You cannot change those parameter types (cls, connection, upload_data_size, req_cls) without breaking the required function signature. In particular:\n- cls: unused in this implementation, but its type is dictated by the callback API (void *cls) so it cannot be made const without changing the required prototype.\n- connection: not modified here, but again its type comes from the external callback definition and must be kept as provided by the library.\n- upload_data_size: not modified in this function, but the library expects a size_t * here (callbacks often update or read *upload_data_size), so the signature must match the API.\n- req_cls: correctly remains non-const because the callback stores a value through *req_cls.\nMISRA permits (and in practice requires) preserving external API signatures; therefore these pointers are not required to be const in this context and there is no rule 8.13 violation in this code."
