  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided snippet. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins shown (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC), statement-expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions).\n- Variadic function syntax (...) and the use of va_list, va_start, va_end are standard C (not extensions).\n- uint16_t is a standard fixed-width integer type from <stdint.h> (C99 and later), not a compiler extension.\n- The leading identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name in the code, but its definition is not present in the snippet. Since the macro expansion is not shown, there is no direct evidence in this code that it expands to a compiler extension; therefore it cannot be flagged here. If the macro is defined elsewhere to expand to a compiler-specific extension (for example __declspec or __attribute__), that definition should be inspected separately.\nGiven the available code, there are no fragments that explicitly use compiler-documented language extensions, so no suspicious fragments are reported."
