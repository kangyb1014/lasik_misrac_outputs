  "scenario": "Not violated \u2014 the local pointer holds/returns a mutable daemon object obtained from MHD_start_daemon_va and is returned to the caller as a non-const pointer, so const-qualification is not appropriate here. (A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for read-only access \u2014 e.g., only passed to functions taking const struct MHD_Daemon * \u2014 in which case it should be declared const.)"
