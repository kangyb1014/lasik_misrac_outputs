  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to any of the parameters (flags, port, apc, apc_cls, dh, dh_cls).\n- Pointer parameters (apc, apc_cls, dh, dh_cls) are only passed by value to other functions; the pointers themselves are not assigned to or altered in this function.\n- The variadic handling (va_list ap; va_start(ap, dh_cls); ... va_end(ap);) operates on the local va_list object and does not modify the dh_cls parameter. \n- The function only calls MHD_start_daemon_va with the collected va_list and returns the result; this does not constitute modifying any of the original parameters.\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
