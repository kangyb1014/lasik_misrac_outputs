  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are used in the provided code fragment. The function only performs varargs setup/teardown (va_start/va_end) and forwards the va_list to MHD_start_daemon_va; there are no direct string operations that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Note: if MHD_start_daemon_va (not shown) uses any <string.h> functions, that function should be inspected separately \u2014 but that is outside the scope of this fragment."
