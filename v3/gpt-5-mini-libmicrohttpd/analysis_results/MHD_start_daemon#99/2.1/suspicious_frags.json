  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function body. Control flow is straight-line: va_start initializes the va_list, the function calls MHD_start_daemon_va, then va_end is executed and the function returns the value stored in daemon. There are no conditional branches, gotos, labels, loops, or code after a return that would produce unreachable statements within this fragment.\n\nNotes for reviewers (not flagged as code fragments here because they are outside the shown code):\n- If MHD_start_daemon_va is declared or defined elsewhere with an attribute indicating it does not return (e.g., __attribute__((noreturn))) or if it unconditionally terminates the program, then the statements after that call (va_end and the return) would indeed be unreachable. Since the declaration/definition of MHD_start_daemon_va is not part of the provided code, that situation could not be determined here \u2014 reviewers should check the declaration/definition of MHD_start_daemon_va to ensure it is not a noreturn function.\n- Also verify macros (e.g., _MHD_EXTERN) do not expand to constructs that alter reachability; none of that is visible in this fragment."
