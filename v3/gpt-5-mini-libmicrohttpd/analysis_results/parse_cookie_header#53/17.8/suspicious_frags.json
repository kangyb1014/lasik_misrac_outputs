  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function has a single parameter: 'struct MHD_Connection *connection'. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter itself (i.e., reassigning the pointer variable), but allows modifying the object the pointer refers to (i.e., the connection structure and its members). A careful scan finds no assignments to the parameter identifier 'connection' (no 'connection = ...' or pointer arithmetic changing it). Operations that might look like modification are assignments to members of the pointed-to object (for example, connection->rq.headers_received_tail = saved_tail; and saved_tail->next = NULL;) \u2014 these modify the object referenced by the pointer, which is permitted by the rule. Other local variables (hdr, hdr_len, cpy, i, parse_res, saved_tail) are locally declared and assigned; allocating memory to cpy, copying into cpy, and calling parse_cookies_string(..., connection) pass the pointer by value and do not reassign the parameter in this function. No address of the parameter is taken (no &connection), and the parameter is not used as an lvalue. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or need investigation under Rule 17.8."
