  "explanation": "The following fragments are not reported because they do not represent potential violations of Rule 8.13 or they already use const where appropriate:\n- The local header pointer is declared as const: \"const char *hdr;\" \u2014 it already points to a const-qualified type.\n- The length/index variables (hdr_len, i) and the enum/local booleans are not pointer types and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The call that obtains the header value (MHD_lookup_connection_value_n) provides a const-qualified hdr output; the lookup uses a const target for the header data.\n- The code explicitly modifies the connection state and the saved header list (allocating via MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, assigning connection->rq.headers_received_tail, and restoring/modifying list pointers). Because the connection and the header-list structures are intentionally mutated by this function, pointers to those structures cannot be made const without preventing required modifications.\n- The code performs explicit writes into the allocated buffer (memcpy and cpy[hdr_len] = '\\0'), demonstrating that the buffer is intentionally mutable; therefore those uses are legitimate as non-const in context.\n- Logging calls (MHD_DLOG) only read data for diagnostics and do not indicate missing const-qualification in the surrounding code shown.\n\nGiven the above, the reported fragments are the places where non-const pointers are created, passed, or used; they should be investigated to confirm whether the pointed-to objects truly need to be mutable (and whether the called functions modify them), or whether a const qualification could be applied to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
