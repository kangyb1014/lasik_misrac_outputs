  "explanation": "I found no obvious invariant controlling expressions of loops or selection statements except for the use of the local const variable allow_partially_correct_cookie as a controlling expression. Rationale for not flagging other control expressions:\n\n- while (i < hdr_len && (' ' == cpy[i] || '\\t' == cpy[i])): the condition depends on i, hdr_len and cpy[] and i is modified in the loop, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- if (MHD_NO == MHD_lookup_connection_value_n(...)) and if (0 == hdr_len): both depend on runtime results (lookup result and hdr_len) and are not compile-time or function-scope invariants.\n\n- The switch (parse_res) is driven by parse_res which is set just prior based on runtime outcomes (allocation success or parse_cookies_string return). The value is not a compile-time constant and the switch is used to select handling of runtime parse results.\n\n- Comparisons against saved_tail (saved_tail != connection->rq.headers_received_tail) depend on whether parse_cookies_string modified the list; that is runtime-mutated state, so the condition is not invariant.\n\n- There are no do-while loops with a constant false controlling expression and no intentional infinite loops (while(1) or for(;;)) in the shown code; thus the two noted MISRA exceptions do not apply elsewhere here.\n\nWhy the reported fragments: allow_partially_correct_cookie is declared const and initialized once from connection->daemon->client_discipline. Because it cannot be modified later in the function, any subsequent if/else tests on that const become invariant during the remainder of the function execution; that pattern can trigger a MISRA Rule 14.3 concern and should be investigated to ensure the use of a const-initialized value as a controlling expression is acceptable in the project context."
