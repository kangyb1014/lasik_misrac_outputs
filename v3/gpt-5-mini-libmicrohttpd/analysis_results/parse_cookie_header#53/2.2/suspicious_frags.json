The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are potential instances of dead or no-effect operations that warrant investigation for MISRA Rule 2.2:  - The various MHD_DLOG(...) blocks (wrapped in #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) are logging side-effects; depending on build/configuration or if their conditions never occur, these statements may be executed while not affecting functional behaviour and thus should be reviewed.  - The saved_tail initialization is an assignment whose removal could be benign if the stored value is never used at runtime in some build/configuration; this should be checked to ensure it is not an unused (dead) operation.  - The code that restores connection->rq.headers_received_tail and sets saved_tail->next = NULL must be kept under review because in some cases it might be skipped and the surrounding logging-only branches might be the only executed statements \u2014 logging-only operations can be considered dead with respect to program behaviour.  - The default branch containing mhd_assert(0) can be a no-op in release builds (asserts often expand to nothing), which may leave an executed but behaviourally irrelevant statement; that should be checked.  - The explicit cast (void) saved_tail; is a no-op expression statement used to suppress compiler warnings; it is executed as an expression statement but has no runtime effect and is a typical example of an operation that could be considered dead code.\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated:  - Early returns (the MHD_lookup_connection_value_n check and hdr_len == 0) are control-flow decisions that clearly affect behaviour and are not dead.  - Memory allocation, the memcpy and the null-termination of cpy, and the whitespace-skip loop directly affect the input to parse_cookies_string and thus program behaviour.  - The assignment to parse_res in both allocation-success and allocation-failure paths and the subsequent switch are necessary for correct result handling.  - The code that restores headers_received_tail and saved_tail->next in the malformed-cookie handling (when executed) clearly changes program state and is not dead; only the logging statements around it are potentially non-functional side-effects.\n\nI focused on fragments that are either pure logging/no-op constructs or expressions that may be compiled away / have no effect at runtime; these are the primary candidates to investigate for Rule 2.2. No other operational code paths (allocation, parsing call, returns, state restoration) were marked as suspicious because they have clear functional effects and removing them would change program behaviour."
