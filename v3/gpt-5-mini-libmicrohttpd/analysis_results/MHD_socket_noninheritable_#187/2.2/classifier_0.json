  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_socket_noninheritable_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_socket_noninheritable_ (MHD_socket sock)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (sock,\n                 F_GETFD);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    return 0;\n\n  if ( ((flags | FD_CLOEXEC) != flags) &&\n       (0 != fcntl (sock,\n                    F_SETFD,\n                    flags | FD_CLOEXEC)) )\n    return 0;\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  if (!

  "scenario": "The statement 'return ! 0;' evaluates to 1 and returns that value from the function. It is executed in normal flow (unless one of the earlier returns occurred) and influences program behavior by providing the function's return value. Removing this return (or the expression) would change the function's observable behavior (and likely lead to undefined behavior if control reaches the end of a non-void function). Therefore this is not dead code."
