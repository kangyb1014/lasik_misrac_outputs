  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_socket_noninheritable_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_socket_noninheritable_ (MHD_socket sock)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (sock,\n                 F_GETFD);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    return 0;\n\n  if ( ((flags | FD_CLOEXEC) != flags) &&\n       (0 != fcntl (sock,\n                    F_SETFD,\n                    flags | FD_CLOEXEC)) )\n    return 0;\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code fragment contains no dead code. The initial fcntl(F_GETFD) reads descriptor flags and is tested for error; the subsequent fcntl(F_SETFD, flags | FD_CLOEXEC) is executed conditionally only when FD_CLOEXEC is not already set and has a side effect (setting the close-on-exec flag). Removing either call or the tests would change program behaviour, so no operation here is dead code."
