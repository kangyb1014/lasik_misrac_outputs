The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (function signature, preprocessor conditionals (#if / #elif / #endif), braces, and comments) are structural or platform-selection constructs and are not individual executed operations that could constitute dead code by Rule 2.2. The parameter 'sock' and the inclusion of platform-specific branches are used by the suspicious fragments listed above, so they do not by themselves represent removable executed operations. No other standalone statements in the function would be executed but removable without changing behaviour beyond the platform-specific operations already selected for investigation."
