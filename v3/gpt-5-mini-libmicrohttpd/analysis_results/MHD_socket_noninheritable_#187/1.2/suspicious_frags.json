  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function and found no use of compiler language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, nested functions, GCC or MSVC builtins, or other vendor-specific keywords). Specific notes: - The conditional compilation (#if defined(...)) and use of platform APIs (fcntl, FD_CLOEXEC for POSIX; SetHandleInformation and HANDLE for WinAPI) are standard preprocessor and platform-API usage, not compiler language extensions. - The cast (HANDLE) sock is a normal C cast; HANDLE is a platform typedef, not a language extension. - The use of the logical-not operator in return ! 0 is standard C and not an extension. - The function declaration and control flow are standard C constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the provided code."
