  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function body contains only calls to fcntl (POSIX) or SetHandleInformation (Windows) and simple integer/flag manipulations and returns. There is no direct call to MHD_socket_noninheritable_ anywhere in the code fragment. There are also no function pointers, callbacks, or other indirections in this fragment that could hide an indirect call back into MHD_socket_noninheritable_. The preprocessor branches restrict the calls to well-known OS APIs; nothing in this code suggests a macro or alias that would expand to a call to the same function. Therefore, there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calling recursion to investigate within this code snippet."
