  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usage relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 was found. The only pointer in this function is the parameter declared as const char *param_name, which already satisfies the requirement that a pointer point to a const-qualified type when possible. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions in the function that would require const qualification. The format strings are string literals (not pointer variables) and there are no additional pointer arguments or assignments that could be made const; the assignment to tool_params.thread_per_conn and the indexed access param_name[1] do not introduce non-const pointer usage. Therefore no fragments need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
