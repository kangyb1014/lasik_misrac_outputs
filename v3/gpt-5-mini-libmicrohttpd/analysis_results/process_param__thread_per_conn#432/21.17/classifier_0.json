  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the code calls fprintf (printf family) from <stdio.h>, not any of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Rule 21.17 specifically targets functions such as memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc. (Note: fprintf(\"%s\", param_name) can still read beyond bounds if param_name is not NUL-terminated, but that is outside the scope of Rule 21.17.) A concrete violation of Rule 21.17 would be, for example, using strcpy(dest, param_name) where dest has insufficient size (dest_size <= strlen(param_name)), causing writes beyond dest's bounds."
