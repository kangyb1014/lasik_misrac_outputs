  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment does not call any functions from <string.h> (it only reads param_name[1>]). MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) leading to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. If param_name were too short, param_name[1] could be an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read, but that would violate a different rule about pointer/index bounds, not Rule 21.17. A concrete example that WOULD violate 21.17 is calling strcpy(dest, src) when src is longer than dest or calling memcpy(dest, src, n) with n larger than dest\u2019s size."
