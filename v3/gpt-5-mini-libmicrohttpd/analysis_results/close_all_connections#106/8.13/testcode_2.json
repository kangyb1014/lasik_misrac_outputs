It could and should be declared as a pointer to const (const struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urhn) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified close_all_connections code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1063.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of close_all_connections as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of close_all_connections:\n```c\nstatic void\nclose_all_connections (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  const bool used_thr_p_c = MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon);\n#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT\n  const bool upg_allowed = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_ALLOW_UPGRADE));\n#endif /* UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT)\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urhn;\n  const bool used_tls = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT && UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!
