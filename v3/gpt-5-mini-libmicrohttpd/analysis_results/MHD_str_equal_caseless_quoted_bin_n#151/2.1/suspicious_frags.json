  "explanation": "I marked the early length check, the entire for-loop (including the explicit increment of i inside the body and the immediate return when an escape is the last character), the character-comparison return, and the final length-equality check as fragments to investigate for possible unreachable code. These are the places where control flow is non-trivial (early returns, manual index modification inside the loop, and loop exit conditions) and therefore most likely to hide an unreachable branch or dead code under certain input/loop-invariant combinations.\n\nOther parts of the function do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1: the local variable declarations (size_t i; size_t j;) are simple and cannot be unreachable; the final \"return true;\" is the natural fall-through result of the function and is reachable when earlier checks pass; comments and whitespace are not relevant. No other code constructs in this function introduce additional control-flow complexity that could produce statically unreachable code beyond the fragments listed above."
