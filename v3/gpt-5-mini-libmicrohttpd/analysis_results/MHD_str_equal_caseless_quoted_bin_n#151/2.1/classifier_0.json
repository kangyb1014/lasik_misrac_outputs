  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the condition depends on the function\u2019s runtime parameters (quoted_len and unquoted_len), so both the true and false paths can be reached for different argument values. Therefore the return in that if does not introduce code that is globally unreachable. (A concrete violation would occur only if the condition were provably constant for all possible executions \u2014 e.g. if the operands were compile-time constants making the test always true or always false \u2014 which is not the case here.)"
