  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string-handling functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. The function performs direct indexed accesses (quoted[i], unquoted[j]) and calls a helper charsequalcaseless, but none of these are calls into <string.h>. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that directly fall under Rule 21.17 and need investigation for accesses beyond bounds caused by <string.h> functions.\n\nNotes for reviewers (not flagged as suspicious here because they are outside Rule 21.17 scope):\n- If the implementation of charsequalcaseless (not shown) internally uses any <string.h> routines, that implementation should be inspected.\n- If quoted or unquoted originate from other code that uses <string.h> functions (e.g., via memcpy/strncpy) those producers should be reviewed to ensure they did not create buffers that lead to out-of-bounds accesses here.\n- The loop logic does perform index increments carefully and includes checks (quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j) and a post-escape check (quoted_len == i) to avoid overruns; those are correctness concerns but not direct violations of Rule 21.17."
