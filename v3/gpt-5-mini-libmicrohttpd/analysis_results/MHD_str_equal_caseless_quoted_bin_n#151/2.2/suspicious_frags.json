  "explanation": "Other fragments are not listed because they are clearly exercised in normal control flow and their removal would change program behaviour: variable declarations (size_t i; size_t j;) are required for the loop indices; the loop body performs the required character comparisons via charsequalcaseless(quoted[i], unquoted[j]) and those calls and the final return true are semantically essential to the function\u2019s result. The quoted/char indexing and the final return value are reachable and affect the outcome, so they are not candidates for dead code. The fragments listed above are the ones that warrant further investigation to determine if they are redundant or executed without affecting observable behaviour (for example the early length check, the interaction of the in-loop i++ with the loop increment, and the final length check)."
