  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments need investigation for potential direct or indirect recursion. The body contains a single external function call (charsequalcaseless); there are no other function calls, no function-pointer invocations, and no calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n within this source fragment. To verify compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2, inspect the implementation (and call graph) of charsequalcaseless and any functions it calls to ensure none call back to MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (directly or indirectly). All other statements in the function (loop control, increments, conditionals, returns, and backslash-handling) are not function calls and therefore do not introduce recursion and do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
