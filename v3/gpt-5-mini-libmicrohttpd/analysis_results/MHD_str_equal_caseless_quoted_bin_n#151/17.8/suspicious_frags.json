  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The parameters are: const char *quoted, size_t quoted_len, const char *unquoted, size_t unquoted_len. The code only reads these parameters (uses quoted[i] and compares i/j against quoted_len and unquoted_len). There are no assignments to quoted, unquoted, quoted_len, or unquoted_len, and no increments or other operations that change those parameters. The increments (i++ and ++i, ++j) operate on local variables i and j, not on any parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to report."
