  "explanation": "Other parts of the function perform substantive, runtime-dependent operations whose removal would change program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n- The outer check if ((argc >= 1) && (NULL != argv[0])) guards all basename extraction logic; removing it would change behaviour when argv is absent or NULL.\n- The strrchr calls and the subsequent logic that selects the last directory separator are used to determine the program name at runtime and are not removable without changing behaviour.\n- The check if (NULL != last_dir_sep) and the computation of name_len and the bounds check ((sizeof(self_name) / sizeof(char)) > name_len) are required to avoid buffer overruns and to ensure correct copying; removing any of these operations would alter behaviour or safety.\n- The early return after copying the extracted name is required to prevent the default name from always overwriting the found name.\n- Compile-time expressions such as sizeof(self_name) / sizeof(char) are not runtime operations and therefore not considered dead code under the rule.\n- The #ifdef _WIN32 conditional itself is conditional compilation, not dead code across the whole project; it is only included on Windows builds.\n\nTherefore, only the listed fragments warrant investigation for potential dead code: the unconditional if (1) wrapper inside the Windows-only block (an operation that is always true and thus seems redundant) and the trailing explicit return after the final strcpy (a runtime operation that has no effect because control would return anyway)."
