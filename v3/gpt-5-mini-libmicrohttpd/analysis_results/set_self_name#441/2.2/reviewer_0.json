  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The 'if (1)' inside the #ifdef _WIN32 block is a constant-true conditional whose evaluation is performed at run-time but has no effect on program behaviour \u2014 removing the conditional (leaving the block body, or just keeping the compound statement) does not change the program semantics. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. This matches the situation here, so the code violates Rule 2.2. (Note: compiler optimizations or the use of the construct to create a scope do not negate the source-level dead-code nature addressed by the rule.)"
