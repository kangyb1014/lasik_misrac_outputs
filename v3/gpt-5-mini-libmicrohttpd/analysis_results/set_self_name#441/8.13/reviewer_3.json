The function only reads argv and the strings it refers to and does not modify the characters; therefore the pointed-to character type should be const-qualified. The parameter should be declared as const char * const *argv (or char const * const *argv) so that the pointers point to a const-qualified type. As written, argv points to non-const char, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The parameter is declared char *const *argv, i.e. a pointer to (const pointer to char). That means the pointed-to character type is unqualified char, yet the function only reads the strings (passes argv[0] to strrchr/strlen and does not modify the characters). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the pointee type here should be const char. The appropriate declaration would be const char * const *argv (or char const * const *argv). Note: in practice changing the prototype may require ensuring callers provide a compatible type (converting char ** to const char * const * is not an implicit conversion), but that is a compatibility concern \u2014 it does not negate the fact that the current declaration violates Rule 8.13."
