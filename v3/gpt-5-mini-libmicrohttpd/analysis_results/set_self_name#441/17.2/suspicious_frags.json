  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls found):\n\n- The function body does not contain any call to set_self_name (direct recursion absent).\n- The only function calls are to standard library routines: strrchr, strlen and strcpy. These are library functions and do not call user-defined set_self_name, so they cannot produce indirect recursion.\n- There are no function pointers, callback invocations, or calls to other user-defined functions in this fragment that could indirectly call set_self_name.\n- Conditional compilation (_WIN32) only changes which standard library calls (strrchr) are used; it does not introduce calls to set_self_name.\n\nBecause the shown code neither calls itself nor invokes any unknown/nonstandard functions or function pointers that might call it, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 17.2 in this snippet."
