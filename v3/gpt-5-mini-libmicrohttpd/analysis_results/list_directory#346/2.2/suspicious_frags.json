  "explanation": "The remaining statements and checks in the function perform observable actions (opening/closing the directory, iterating entries, calling stat, skipping non-regular files, allocating and assigning the buffer, updating rdc->off, returning a result). Those operations have clear side effects on program behaviour or resource usage, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 and therefore were not included for further investigation. The four fragments listed above are the parts that warrant closer review for possible redundant/ineffective or always-true/always-false behavior that could amount to executed code whose removal might not change program behaviour."
