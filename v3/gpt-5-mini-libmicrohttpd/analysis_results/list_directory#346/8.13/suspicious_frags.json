  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointers that could point to const-qualified types. The listed fragments involve the variable 'de' (the pointer returned by readdir) and all direct uses of de->d_name; these are read-only in this function and therefore should be investigated to determine whether 'de' (or its pointed-to type) could be declared const. Other pointer usages in the function do not require investigation for this rule: - rdc (struct ResponseDataContext *): the function modifies rdc->off, rdc->buf_len and rdc->buf, so rdc cannot be const. - dirname (const char *): already const-qualified. - DIR *dir: the DIR object represents an opaque stream that is passed to functions that expect DIR * (not const DIR *); making it const would be incompatible with the APIs and it is not purely read-only. - void *r and rdc->buf: these are used for realloc and writing; they must remain non-const. - fullname (char array) and sbuf (struct stat): not pointer-to-object declarations requiring const qualification. Therefore no other fragments need investigation under Rule 8.13."
