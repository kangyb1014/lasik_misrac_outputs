True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer 'de' is declared as 'struct dirent *de' but only read (de->d_name[0] is used). The pointer could and should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct dirent *de' or 'const char *name = de->d_name') because the code does not modify the pointed data. Thus Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. In the function de is only used for read-only accesses (de->d_name[0], de->d_name passed to snprintf). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so declaring de as const struct dirent *de (or extracting a const char *name = de->d_name) would be appropriate. Converting the result of readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to a pointer-to-const is permitted in C and prevents accidental modification through de; it does not interfere with readdir semantics. Therefore Agent A's report that this code violates Rule 8.13 is correct."
