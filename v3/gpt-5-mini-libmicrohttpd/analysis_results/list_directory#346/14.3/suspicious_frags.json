  "explanation": "I have listed all controlling expressions (while and all if statements) from the function as suspicious fragments for investigation. No other controlling expressions remain in the function; therefore there are no additional fragments to consider. Each listed fragment should be reviewed for Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) and any related semantic/overflow concerns (for example the overflow test using 2 * rdc->buf_len + 1024)."
