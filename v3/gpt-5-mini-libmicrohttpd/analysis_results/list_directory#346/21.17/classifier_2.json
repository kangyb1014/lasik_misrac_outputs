  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code checks snprintf()'s return value (res > 0 is enforced earlier) and then compares the number of characters snprintf would have written to the remaining buffer space via if (rdc->buf_len - rdc->off <= (size_t) res) continue;. Because snprintf() returns the number of characters that would have been written (excluding the terminating NUL), the test res >= remaining correctly detects truncation and prevents out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes. Negative res is handled earlier, and remaining is computed from size_t fields, so this fragment does not cause a string.h related out\u2011of\u2011bounds access (Rule 21.17). A violation scenario would occur if the code omitted the res <= 0 check before casting or computed the remaining size incorrectly (underflow), which could allow a truncated write to go unchecked."
