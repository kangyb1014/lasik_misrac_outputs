  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically checked and found nothing to report: \n- No compiler intrinsics or extension keywords (no __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof, __asm, __extension__, or similar). \n- No GCC/Clang nested functions or statement-expressions ({: :}) or label-as-values. \n- No C++ features (classes, references, templates, new/delete). \n- No zero-length or other non-standard array declarations; fullname is a fixed-size array using PATH_MAX. \n- No use of non-standard storage-class/specifier extensions (e.g. register with special semantics). \n- Declarations and control flow constructs are standard C (enum, static, casts, sizeof, pointer arithmetic). \n- Library/POSIX APIs used (opendir/readdir/closedir, struct dirent, stat, S_ISREG, PATH_MAX, snprintf, realloc) are runtime/library facilities, not compiler language extensions; Rule 1.2 refers to language/compiler extensions explicitly documented by the compiler. \nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
