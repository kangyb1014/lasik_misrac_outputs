  "explanation": "No function parameter itself is modified in this function. The parameters are:\n- struct ResponseDataContext *rdc \u2014 only members of *rdc are written (rdc->buf_len, rdc->buf, rdc->off); modifying the object pointed to is permitted by Rule 17.8. There is no assignment to the pointer variable rdc itself (no statement like \"rdc = ...\"), no pointer arithmetic on rdc, and no cast that would modify the pointer parameter.\n- const char *dirname \u2014 it is only read (passed to opendir/stat/snprintf); it is not written to or reassigned. There is no cast away of const to modify its pointee.\nOther local pointers (dir, de, r) are local variables and not function parameters, so their modification does not affect Rule 17.8. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 17.8."
