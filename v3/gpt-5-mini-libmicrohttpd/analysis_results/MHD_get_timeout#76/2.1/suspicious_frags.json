  "explanation": "All other lines in the function are simple declarations or single statements that do not introduce additional control-flow paths that could be inherently unreachable (e.g., the function signature, the local variable declaration uint64_t t64;, and the assignment/cast that are part of the flagged preprocessor block). No other conditional or labelled constructs exist in the function that could produce unreachable code, so only the listed fragments warrant further investigation with respect to Rule 2.1."
