  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and the three clauses of a for loop. The supplied function contains no for statement (no occurrence of the 'for' token), nor any loop constructs (no while or do-while). The code uses if/return, a function call (MHD_get_timeout64), a cast, and preprocessor conditionals \u2014 none of which are for loops or contain for-loop clauses to be checked under Rule 14.2. There are also no obvious macros in this fragment that would expand to a for loop (MHD_EXTERN is a linkage/storage macro, MHD_get_timeout64 is a function call, SIZEOF_* are compile-time constants), so nothing in this snippet can be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.2. Therefore no code fragments in this snippet need to be reported for further investigation under Rule 14.2."
