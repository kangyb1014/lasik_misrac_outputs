  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions are present in the shown code. The runtime if controlling expressions are:\n- if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &t64)) \u2014 this depends on the return value of the function call, so it is not an invariant at compile time.\n- if (ULLONG_MAX <= t64) \u2014 this compares a compile-time constant to the runtime variable t64, so it is not invariant.\nThe #if SIZEOF_UINT64_T > SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG is a preprocessor conditional (handled at translation time), not a C-language controlling expression governed by MISRA C Rule 14.3; therefore it is not a candidate for this rule. No do/while or other loops with constant controlling expressions are present. \n(If MHD_get_timeout64 were actually a macro that expands to a constant expression in this translation unit, that could create an invariant \u2014 but based on the provided code it is a function call, so no invariant controlling expressions exist.)"
