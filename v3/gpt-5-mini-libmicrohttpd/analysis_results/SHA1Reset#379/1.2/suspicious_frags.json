  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function with an enum return type, an ANSI-style prototype (single pointer parameter), standard integer hex constants, struct member accesses and assignments, and standard control flow (if/return). There are no compiler-specific or nonstandard tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __inline/__inline__, typeof, statement expressions ({...;}) as an expression, nested functions, labels-as-values, pragmas that enable vendor extensions, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
