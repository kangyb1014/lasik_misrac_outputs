  "explanation": "No calls to the standard <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear directly in the provided code fragment. The remaining lines are simple control-flow or integer checks (version check, remaining_upload_size check, return statements) and macros (MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) that do not, by themselves, indicate use of <string.h> functions. The two calls listed as suspicious are library/internal API calls that take or return string pointers/lengths and therefore must be inspected (their implementations may call standard string functions or otherwise perform buffer accesses). Everything else in the function does not directly involve string handling from <string.h> and so does not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 based on the code shown."
