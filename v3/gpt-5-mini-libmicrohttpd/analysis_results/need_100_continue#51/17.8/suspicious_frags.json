  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection'. The code only dereferences this pointer (connection->...) and passes it by value to functions/macros; there is no assignment to the parameter identifier (no 'connection = ...'), no increment/decrement of the parameter, and no other operation that rebinds or modifies the pointer itself. Assignments to members of the pointed-to object would be permitted by Rule 17.8, but none occur here (only reads of connection->rq.http_ver and connection->rq.remaining_upload_size). Calls such as MHD_lookup_connection_value_n receive the pointer by value; even if those functions modify the object pointed-to, that is allowed by the rule. Therefore no code fragment in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
