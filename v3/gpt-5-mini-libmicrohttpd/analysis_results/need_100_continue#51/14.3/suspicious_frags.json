  "explanation": "All conditional controlling expressions in the function have been reported for investigation. These are the only control-flow expressions (if statements) in the provided code and therefore the only places where an invariant controlling expression relevant to MISRA C Rule 14.3 could occur. Other code fragments (function signature, local variable declaration, return statements that are not conditional, string literal, and macro argument expressions) are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3; there are no loops or switch statements in this snippet to consider."
