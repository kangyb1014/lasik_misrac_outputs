  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found in this code fragment with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer visible is the function parameter param_name, which is declared as const char * (i.e. the pointee is const-qualified), satisfying the rule. The code reads from param_name (param_name[1]) but does not modify the pointee. The fprintf calls pass param_name as a const string for the '%s' format specifier, which is consistent with the const qualification. There are no other pointer declarations in this fragment (tool_params.shared/single/unique appear to be scalar flags, not pointers). The FILE* stderr is an external library object and is not declared or modified here; its usage via fprintf does not violate the rule in this fragment. Therefore no code fragments in the provided function require further investigation for Rule 8.13."
