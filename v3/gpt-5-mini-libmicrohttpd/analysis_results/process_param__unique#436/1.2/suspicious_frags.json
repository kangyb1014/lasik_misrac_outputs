  "explanation": "I examined the function for compiler-specific language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), GCC builtins, inline assembly, nonstandard keywords, compiler pragmas, named/unnamed bit-field extensions, flexible array-member syntax outside standard, or other documented compiler extensions). None are present. Specific items reviewed:\n- String literal split across two adjacent literals is standard C concatenation, not an extension.\n- The expression `! 0` is plain logical negation of integer constant 0; this is standard C, not an extension.\n- The ternary operator and character comparison (`'-' == param_name[1] ? ... : ...`) are standard C constructs.\n- Declarations (`static`, `enum PerfRepl_param_result`, `const char *`) and use of `fprintf` are standard.\n- Macro-like identifiers (PERF_RPL_...) are normal macros/constants, not compiler extensions.\n- The identifier containing a double underscore (process_param__unique) may be reserved by the implementation per the C standard, but that is a portability/reserved-identifier concern, not a compiler language extension explicitly documented as an extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that use documented compiler language extensions and nothing to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
