  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for Rule 17.2 were found. process_param__unique does not call itself and contains no other function calls except fprintf (a standard library routine), so there is no direct recursion. There are no function-pointer dereferences, no calls to other project functions, and no macros that expand to function calls in the provided code \u2014 only simple member tests, an assignment, and a ternary return of enum constants. Therefore there is no evidence of indirect recursion in this fragment that would violate Rule 17.2. If any surrounding code (not shown) uses function pointers, callbacks, or a dispatch mechanism that could call back into process_param__unique, that surrounding code should be reviewed; however, nothing in the shown fragment itself warrants investigation for recursion."
