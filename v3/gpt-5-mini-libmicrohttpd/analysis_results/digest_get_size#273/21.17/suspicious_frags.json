  "explanation": "No uses of the string.h API are present in the given function. The code contains only: - mhd_assert calls (likely macros), - simple dereferences of the struct pointer to read boolean flags and an enum-like field (da->uninitialised, da->algo_selected, da->algo), - preprocessor-selected returns of compile-time digest-size constants (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE), and - a fallback assert/return. None of these perform buffer or string operations (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so there is no possibility of accesses beyond object bounds caused by string.h functions in this fragment. The only pointer access is simple member access of the provided struct pointer; while that could be a general runtime safety concern (e.g., null pointer), it is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 which specifically targets use of string.h functions. Therefore there are no fragments to investigate for Rule 21.17 in this code."
