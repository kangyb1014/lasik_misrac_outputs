Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed (function signature, braces, preprocessor #ifdef/#endif lines and comments) need not be investigated for dead code: they are either non-executable (directives/comments) or are required to conditionally include algorithm-specific code. The listed runtime checks and returns are the executable parts whose presence/absence or conditional compilation can produce code that is executed but may be redundant in some build/configurations; those are therefore flagged for investigation under Rule 2.2. No other executable statements exist in the function that would be candidates for dead-code analysis."
