  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_get_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline unsigned int\ndigest_get_size (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The statement mhd_assert(da->algo_selected); is an assertion of a runtime invariant and may cause a visible effect (logging/abort) if the condition fails. Removing it could change program behaviour in the case the invariant is violated, so it is not dead code. If mhd_assert is compiled out (becomes an empty macro), then no executable code is generated for the statement and it is simply not executed (therefore not \"dead code\" under Rule 2.2, which concerns executed operations removable without effect)."
