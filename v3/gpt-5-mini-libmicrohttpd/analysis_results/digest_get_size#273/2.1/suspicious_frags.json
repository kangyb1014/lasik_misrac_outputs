  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not present clear unreachable-code concerns and therefore need no further investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1. The function signature and the initial runtime assertions (mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised); mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);) are runtime checks and are reachable. The conditional comparisons against da->algo (the if statements inside the #ifdef blocks) are runtime-dependent and so are not inherently unreachable; they are included above only because, depending on build-time configuration, they may cause later code to become unreachable. The listed fragments cover all locations in the function that could be statically or intentionally unreachable (the guarded return branches and the final assert/return fallback). No other lines in this function exhibit characteristics of unreachable code that would require investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
