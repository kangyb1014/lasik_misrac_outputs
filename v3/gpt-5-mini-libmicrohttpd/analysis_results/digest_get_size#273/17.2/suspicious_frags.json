  "explanation": "The only tokens in this function that could expand to code invoking functions (and thus possibly perform direct or indirect calls back into digest_get_size) are the mhd_assert macro usages. The remaining fragments are simple constant comparisons, preprocessor guards, and return statements (returns of MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE, or 0) which do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion. The function signature and the _MHD_static_inline storage-class specifier do not themselves constitute calls. No explicit call to digest_get_size appears in the body."
