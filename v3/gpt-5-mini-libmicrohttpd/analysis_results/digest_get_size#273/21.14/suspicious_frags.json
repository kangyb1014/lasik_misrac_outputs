  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp or any other string-comparison functions are present in the provided code. The function only performs integer/enum comparisons (da->algo against MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_*), returns compile-time size macros (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE), and calls mhd_assert. There are no null-terminated string objects, no char* comparisons, and no calls to functions from <string.h> in this fragment, so Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any part of this code."
