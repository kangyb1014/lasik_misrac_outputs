  "scenario": "The fragment uses a standard C cast to ssize_t: (ssize_t) bytes_read. Casting is part of ISO C and does not rely on any compiler-specific language extension. ssize_t is a POSIX typedef (not a compiler language extension); its use may be non\u2011portable if not provided by the target platform, but it is not an explicit compiler extension. No language extensions are used here."
