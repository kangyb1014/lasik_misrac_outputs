  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. All pointer uses in this function are either already const-qualified where appropriate or must be non-const because they are used for output/modification: - pct_encoded is declared const char * (correct since the function does not modify the input). - decoded is a non-const char * but is written to (decoded[w] = ...), so it must not be const. - The only other address-taken value is &broken (in the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE branch) which is used as an output parameter and therefore correctly non-const. No other pointer types are present in the code, so there are no candidates that should be const-qualified under Rule 8.13."
