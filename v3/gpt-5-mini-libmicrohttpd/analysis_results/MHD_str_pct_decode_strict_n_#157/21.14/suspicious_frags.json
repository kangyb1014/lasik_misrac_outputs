  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other library string-comparison function such as strcmp/strncmp) appear in the provided function. The code performs character-by-character checks and assignments (e.g. comparing chr to '%' via '==' and calling toxdigitvalue), and manipulates buffer lengths explicitly; it does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There is also no evidence of an indirect call or macro expansion to memcmp within this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
