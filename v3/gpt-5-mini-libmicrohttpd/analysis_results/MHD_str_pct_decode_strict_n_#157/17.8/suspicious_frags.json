  "explanation": "No function parameters are assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The code modifies the contents of the buffer pointed to by decoded (e.g. decoded[w] = ...), which is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The pointer parameters themselves (pct_encoded and decoded) are never reassigned or incremented; only local indices r and w are changed. Scalar parameters (pct_encoded_len, buf_size) are not written to. Both the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE and the !MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE branches were checked and contain no assignments that alter the parameter variables, so there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
