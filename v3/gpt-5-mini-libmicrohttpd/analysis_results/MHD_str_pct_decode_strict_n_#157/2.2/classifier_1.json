  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ (const char *pct_encoded,\n                              size_t pct_encoded_len,\n                              char *decoded,\n                              size_t buf_size)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  bool broken;\n  size_t res;\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_ (pct_encoded, pct_encoded_len, decoded,\n                                       buf_size, &broken);\n  if (broken)\n    return 0;\n  return res;\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Every executed operation in the fragment contributes to the result or to defined behaviour: the guard (2 > pct_encoded_len - r) and the subsequent checks on h and l determine early returns; the pre-increments (++r) advance the read index and are required; the sequence of casts and the final assignment produce the decoded byte and ensure defined unsigned behaviour when shifting/combining digits. Removing the increments or the validity checks would change behaviour, and even some casts, while they appear redundant on many implementations, are present to control signedness and integer-promotion effects and therefore cannot be safely removed in general. There is no dead code here."
