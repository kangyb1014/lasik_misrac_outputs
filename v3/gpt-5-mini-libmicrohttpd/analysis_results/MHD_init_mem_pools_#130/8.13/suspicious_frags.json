  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables appear in this function that could be made to point to const-qualified types. The only pointer usage is the address-of operator on the local SYSTEM_INFO variable passed to GetSystemInfo (&si); that API fills/modifies the structure, so the pointed-to type must be non-const. There are no other pointer parameters, returns, or assignments (no char*, void*, or similar) in this fragment that would be eligible for const-qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
