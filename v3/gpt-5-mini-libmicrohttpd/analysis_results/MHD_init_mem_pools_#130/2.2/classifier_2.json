  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_init_mem_pools_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_init_mem_pools_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_SC_PAGESIZE\n  long result;\n  result = sysconf (MHD_SC_PAGESIZE);\n  if (-1 != result)\n    MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) result;\n  else\n    MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_;\n#elif defined(_WIN32)\n  SYSTEM_INFO si;\n  GetSystemInfo (&si);\n  MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) si.dwPageSize;\n#else\n  MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_;\n#endif /* _WIN32 */\n  mhd_assert (0 == (MHD_sys_page_size_ % ALIGN_SIZE));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef MHD_SC_PAGESIZE\n  long result;\n  result = sysconf (MHD_SC_PAGESIZE);\n  if (-1 != result)\n    MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) result;\n  else\n    MHD_sys_page_size_ = (size_t) MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment calls sysconf, stores and tests its return value and assigns MHD_sys_page_size_ accordingly. Each operation (calling sysconf, assigning result, the if/else assignment) affects program behaviour \u2014 removing them would change the value of MHD_sys_page_size_ (and the sysconf call itself), so they are not dead. There is no executed operation whose removal would have no effect, therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
