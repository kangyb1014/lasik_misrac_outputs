  "explanation": "The only parts of the function that could be conditionally compiled away (and thus potentially become unreachable in a given build configuration) are the three preprocessor-controlled branches above. Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: the function signature and opening/closing braces are always compiled; the final mhd_assert call is unconditional and executed in every build where the function is present; the runtime conditional (if (-1 != result) ... else ...) inside the MHD_SC_PAGESIZE branch is a runtime decision and therefore not statically unreachable (it must be retained for investigation only when that branch is compiled). Variable declarations that appear only inside a compiled branch are normal and not unreachable when that branch is active. Hence only the platform/feature-specific preprocessor branches are suspicious and should be examined to ensure no unreachable code is present across project build configurations."
