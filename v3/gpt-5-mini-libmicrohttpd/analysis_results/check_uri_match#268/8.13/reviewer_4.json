If connection->rq.url is declared as char * (non-const) even though it is never modified, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should be const-qualified (e.g. const char *url) when possible. Note: uri must remain non-const because it is modified earlier in the function.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The provided code does not itself demonstrate a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible), but the snippet does not show the declaration of connection->rq.url. Passing a char * to memcmp is fine because memcmp takes const void * \u2014 no type-compatibility error is shown here.\n\nAgent A\u2019s claim is speculative: although connection->rq.url is used only for reading in this function and could perhaps be declared const char * if it is never modified anywhere in the program, you cannot conclude from this function alone that the declaration fails to qualify the target as const. If the actual declaration of rq.url is non-const despite never being modified anywhere, then that declaration would be the place of a potential Rule 8.13 violation \u2014 not the memcmp call. To determine a real violation you must inspect the declaration and all uses of connection->rq.url across the codebase to see whether it is ever updated. Without that evidence, the report is not supported by the code shown."
