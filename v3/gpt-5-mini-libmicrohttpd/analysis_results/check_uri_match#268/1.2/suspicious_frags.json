  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The constructs present are all standard C: function definition with a bool return (C99 stdbool.h), pointer and const-pointer declarations (struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon), standard library function memchr, use of NULL and 0, function-pointer invocation (daemon->unescape_callback(...)), the ternary operator, and standard preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES). There are no GCC/Clang-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, designated initializers beyond standard C, or other compiler-documented extensions. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
