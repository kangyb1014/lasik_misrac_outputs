  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_to_fd_set_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_add_to_fd_set_ (MHD_socket fd,\n                    fd_set *set,\n                    MHD_socket *max_fd,\n                    int fd_setsize)\n{\n  if ( (NULL == set) ||\n       (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET == fd) )\n    return 0;\n\n#ifndef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n  (void) fd_setsize;  /* Mute compiler warning */\n  fd_setsize = (int) FD_SETSIZE; /* Help compiler to optimise */\n#endif /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a macro invocation, not a for statement. As written there is no for loop to check, so Rule 14.2 is not violated by this fragment. (Note: if the macro MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_ expands to a for loop that violates the clause requirements \u2014 for example, using more than one loop counter, modifying the loop counter in the loop body, or having second/third clauses that reference objects that are modified inside the body \u2014 then the expanded code would violate Rule 14.2.)"
