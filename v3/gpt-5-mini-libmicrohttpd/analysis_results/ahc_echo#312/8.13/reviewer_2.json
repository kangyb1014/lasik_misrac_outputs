According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection' where possible. (If the called API MHD_queue_response requires a non-const pointer, adding const is not possible and there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should be to const-qualified types when possible, but only when doing so is actually feasible. ahc_echo is a callback whose parameter types are dictated by the external library\u2019s API (libmicrohttpd): the function must match the required prototype and the connection object is forwarded to MHD_queue_response, which in typical libmicrohttpd signatures takes a non-const struct MHD_Connection *. You cannot change the parameter\u2019s const-qualification without breaking the required prototype or the call to the library. Agent A has not shown that the surrounding API allows making the pointer const. Therefore there is no proven MISRA 8.13 violation in this code as presented."
