  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void) req_cls;\u201d is an executed no\u2011op: it evaluates the parameter and discards the result, has no side effects, and removing it would not affect program behaviour. That matches the wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code). The same applies to the other (void) parameter casts in the function. A relevant caveat: if the expression had observable side effects (for example, involved a volatile object or a function call), then its removal could change behaviour and it would not be dead code; that is not the case here. Remediations include omitting the parameter name in the function prototype/definition (leaving the type only), using a compiler-supported UNUSED attribute, or otherwise using the parameter in a meaningful way."
