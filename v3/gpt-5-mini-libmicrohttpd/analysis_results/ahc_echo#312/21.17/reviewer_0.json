Example: if method == NULL, strcmp will dereference a NULL pointer; if method points to a buffer lacking a '\\0' within its allocated size, strcmp will read past the buffer searching for the terminator.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 21.17 forbids using <string.h> functions in a way that can access beyond the referenced objects. The call strcmp(method, \"GET\") will dereference method and then scan for a terminating '\\0'; if method is NULL or points to a buffer that is not NUL-terminated within its bounds, strcmp can perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. The provided code performs no NULL check or otherwise guarantees that method is a valid NUL-terminated string, so the use of strcmp here can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If, and only if, the surrounding API contract formally guarantees that method is non-NULL and NUL-terminated and that guarantee is documented/verifiable, the call would be compliant \u2014 otherwise a runtime NULL/termination check or a bounded comparison is required.)"
