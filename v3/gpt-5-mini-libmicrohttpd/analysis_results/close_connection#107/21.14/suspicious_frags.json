  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp appear in this function. The code only performs pointer checks, integer/boolean comparisons, mutex operations, assertions, and calls to helper functions (MHD_connection_close_, DLL_remove, XDLL_remove, etc.). There are no string operations, char buffers, or memory comparisons in the shown fragment that would indicate memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
