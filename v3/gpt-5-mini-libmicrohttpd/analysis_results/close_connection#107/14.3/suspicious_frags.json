  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions of C selection/iteration statements or are compile-time preprocessor directives. Specifically:\n- The mhd_assert(...) lines are assertion macros (evaluation/checks) and are not selection/iteration controlling statements in the C code that Rule 14.3 targets.\n- The #if / #endif preprocessor directives (e.g. #if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)) are compile-time directives, not C-language controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3.\n- Function calls such as MHD_connection_close_, XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, and other statements like return; are ordinary statements or calls and are not controlling expressions of selection/iteration constructs.\n- There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) in this function whose controlling expressions would need checking for invariance.\nTherefore only the two if(...) controlling expressions listed above warrant investigation for possible invariance."
