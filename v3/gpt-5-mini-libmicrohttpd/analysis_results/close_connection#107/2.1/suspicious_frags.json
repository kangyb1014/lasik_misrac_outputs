  "explanation": "The early return inside the if (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_(daemon)) block makes the remainder of the function unreachable whenever that condition is true; both the if-block (with the return) and the subsequent code path must be examined to ensure no permanently unreachable code exists in any project configuration. Other fragments were not selected because they are either conditional on compilation macros (#ifdef / #if defined) and therefore not inherently unreachable, or are simple assertions and list-manipulation calls that are executed when the thread-per-connection condition is false. Specifically: the top #ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS block contains only assertions compiled conditionally and does not by itself create unreachable code; the mutex lock/unlock calls are guarded by the same compilation macros and are paired (lock present before unlock when those macros are defined); the mhd_assert calls and the XDLL/DLL insert/remove lines are part of the normal execution path when thread-per-connection is not in effect. These other fragments should not be investigated for Rule 2.1 since they are not unconditionally unreachable within the source as presented."
