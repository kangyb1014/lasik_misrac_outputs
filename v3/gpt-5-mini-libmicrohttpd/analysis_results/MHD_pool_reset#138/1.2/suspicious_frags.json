  "explanation": "I flagged only the fragments that reference AddressSanitizer-related identifiers or macros with leading underscores that commonly map to compiler/toolchain-provided instrumentation (e.g. __asan_region_is_poisoned and the _MHD_* POISON/UNPOISON macros). These names are the most likely to be compiler/toolchain-specific extensions or wrappers around such extensions and therefore should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C Rule 1.2.\n\nOther parts of the function were not flagged because they use standard C language constructs or platform APIs rather than compiler language extensions: casts, pointer arithmetic, standard types (size_t, uint8_t), standard library calls (memmove, memset, abort), preprocessor conditionals and line continuation, user-defined macros (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE), and the Windows API calls (VirtualFree/VirtualAlloc) are OS APIs rather than compiler language extensions. These items do not by themselves indicate use of a compiler language extension and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
