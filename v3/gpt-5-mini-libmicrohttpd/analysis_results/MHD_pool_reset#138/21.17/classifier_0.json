  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated when the function's preceding assertions hold: the code asserts copy_bytes <= pool->size and (if keep != NULL) that keep lies within pool->memory and keep + copy_bytes <= pool->memory + pool->size, so memmove(pool->memory, keep, copy_bytes) will not read or write beyond the pool memory block. However, if those assertions are not active (for example mhd_assert is compiled out) a concrete violating scenario is: pool->memory = p, pool->size = 100, keep = p + 90, copy_bytes = 20 \u2014 then memmove(p, p + 90, 20) will read 10 bytes beyond the source object; similarly copy_bytes = 120 would write beyond the destination. In other words, correctness depends on the runtime checks being enforced."
