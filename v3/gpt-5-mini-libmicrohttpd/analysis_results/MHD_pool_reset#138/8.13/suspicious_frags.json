  "explanation": "All occurrences of the pointer parameter 'keep' are reported above because 'keep' is only used as a source (read-only) for checks and for memmove; therefore it is a candidate to be const-qualified (e.g. 'const void *keep'). Other pointer uses in the function are not reported because they are not suitable for const qualification: the 'pool' parameter is modified (pool->pos, pool->end), so it cannot be const; pool->memory is written to (memmove destination, memset, OS decommit/recommit), so it must remain a non-const pointer; recommit_addr is passed to VirtualFree/VirtualAlloc and used for memory operations that require a writable pointer; the _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY/_MHD_POISON_MEMORY macros and memset operate on/modify memory and/or tooling state and therefore require non-const pointers. For these reasons, only the fragments involving 'keep' were flagged for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
