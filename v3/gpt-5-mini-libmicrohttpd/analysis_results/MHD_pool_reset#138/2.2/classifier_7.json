The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_reset:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_reset (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                void *keep,\n                size_t copy_bytes,\n                size_t new_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (copy_bytes <= new_size);\n  mhd_assert (copy_bytes <= pool->size);\n  mhd_assert (keep != NULL || copy_bytes == 0);\n  mhd_assert (keep == NULL || mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, keep));\n  /* (keep == NULL || pool->memory + pool->size >= (uint8_t*) keep + copy_bytes) */\n  mhd_assert ((keep == NULL) || \\\n              (pool->size >= mp_ptr_diff_ (keep, pool->memory) + copy_bytes));\n#if defined(MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE) && defined(HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == __asan_region_is_poisoned (keep, copy_bytes));\n#endif /* MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE && HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED */\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory, new_size);\n  if ( (NULL != keep) &&\n       (keep != pool->memory) )\n  {\n    if (0 != copy_bytes)\n      memmove (pool->memory,\n               keep,\n               copy_bytes);\n  }\n  /* technically not needed, but safer to zero out */\n  if (pool->size > copy_bytes)\n  {\n    size_t to_zero;   /** Size of area to zero-out */\n\n    to_zero = pool->size - copy_bytes;\n    _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory + copy_bytes, to_zero);\n#ifdef _WIN32\n    if (pool->is_mmap)\n    {\n      size_t to_recommit;     /** Size of decommitted and re-committed area. */\n      uint8_t *recommit_addr;\n      /* Round down to page size */\n      to_recommit = to_zero - to_zero % MHD_sys_page_size_;\n      recommit_addr = pool->memory + pool->size - to_recommit;\n\n      /* De-committing and re-committing again clear memory and make\n       * pages free / available for other needs until accessed. */\n      if (VirtualFree (recommit_addr,\n                       to_recommit,\n                       MEM_DECOMMIT))\n      {\n        to_zero -= to_recommit;\n\n        if (recommit_addr != VirtualAlloc (recommit_addr,\n                                           to_recommit,\n                                           MEM_COMMIT,\n                                           PAGE_READWRITE))\n          abort ();      /* Serious error, must never happen */\n      }\n    }\n#endif /* _WIN32 */\n    memset (&pool->memory[copy_bytes],\n            0,\n            to_zero);\n  }\n  pool->pos = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (new_size);\n  pool->end = pool->size;\n  _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (((uint8_t *) pool->memory) + new_size, \\\n                      pool->size - new_size);\n  return pool->memory;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_POISON_MEMORY (((uint8_t *) pool->memory) + new_size, \\\n                      pool->size - new_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to _MHD_POISON_MEMORY is intended to mark the trailing bytes as poisoned (for ASAN/diagnostic builds). If the macro actually performs poisoning in some build configurations, its removal would change program behaviour in those builds (diagnostic detection of invalid accesses), so it is not dead code. However, if in every build configuration _MHD_POISON_MEMORY is defined as a no-op (expands to nothing or performs no observable action), then that call would be executed but its removal would not affect behaviour, and it would violate Rule 2.2. To decide concretely, inspect the definition of _MHD_POISON_MEMORY and the build configurations that enable it."
