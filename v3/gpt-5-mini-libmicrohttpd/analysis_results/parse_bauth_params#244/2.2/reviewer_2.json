Thus the assert has no effect on program behaviour (its removal would not change behaviour), so it is executed but constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert(0 != token68_len) is not necessarily dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. Although, based on the local control flow, token68_len is provably > 0 (the initial whitespace-skip and the if (str_len > i) guarantee the following token-loop iterates at least once), that only shows the assertion will never fail; it does not automatically make the assertion an operation whose removal cannot affect program behaviour. An assertion can have observable effects (diagnostics, logging, trap/abort in debug builds, timing changes, or other side effects depending on how mhd_assert is implemented). Removing the assertion could therefore change the program\u2019s observable behaviour in some builds or under fault conditions (and the presence of the assertion documents the intended invariant and provides a defensive check). In short, the call is reachable and executed, and its removal could alter diagnostics/timing/behaviour in some configurations, so it does not meet the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
