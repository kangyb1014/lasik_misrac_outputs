  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_bauth_params:\n```c\nstatic bool\nparse_bauth_params (const char *str,\n                    size_t str_len,\n                    struct MHD_RqBAuth *pbauth)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  i = 0;\n\n  /* Skip all whitespaces at start */\n  while (i < str_len && (' ' == str[i] || '\\t' == str[i]))\n    i++;\n\n  if (str_len > i)\n  {\n    size_t token68_start;\n    size_t token68_len;\n\n    /* 'i' points to the first non-whitespace char after scheme token */\n    token68_start = i;\n    /* Find end of the token.

  "scenario": "The two assignments are not inherently dead: they store the parsed token location/length into the output structure pbauth so callers can use the parsed token. Therefore, by themselves they do not violate Rule 2.2. A concrete violation scenario would be if every caller of parse_bauth_params ignores the pbauth output (never reads pbauth->token68.str/len) or if those fields are always overwritten before any read \u2014 in that case the assignments are dead (their removal would not affect program behaviour)."
