  "explanation": "I listed every controlling expression (while and if conditions) present in the function so each can be inspected for possible invariant behavior under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Other code fragments were not listed because they are not controlling expressions (variable declarations/assignments such as i = 0, token68_start/token68_len assignments, mhd_assert, pointer/length stores into pbauth, and simple return statements). Those non-control statements cannot violate the \u2018\u2018controlling expressions shall not be invariant\u2019\u2019 rule and therefore do not require investigation for this specific rule."
