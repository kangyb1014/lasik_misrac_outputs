  "explanation": "All other fragments implement the function's observable behavior and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the early-return branch that sets *req_cls and returns MHD_YES controls connection state and timing; the method-check and return MHD_NO affect control flow for unsupported methods; the conditional (preprocessor) response-creation blocks are active code selected at build time (not runtime dead code); the call to MHD_queue_response and subsequent MHD_destroy_response are required to produce and clean up the HTTP response. The initialization note (initialization is not the same as assignment) explains that simple initialization at definition is not a dead-code candidate, but the static variable is listed above for investigation because its value is never read (only its address is used)."
