Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments in the function are plain variable declarations, trivial assignments or the final return that clearly affect program behaviour and are not candidates for dead code: - enum MHD_Result ret; and struct MHD_Response *response; are used to hold results and are referenced later. - const char *form = cls; is used to compute strlen(form) and to supply the buffer pointer; removing it would change behaviour. - The final return ret; returns the queued-response result to the caller; removing it would change the function contract. - The comment and function signature are not executable code. These parts therefore do not meet the definition of dead code and do not require investigation under Rule 2.2."
