  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to any parameter identifiers (cls, mime, session, connection) and no uses of increment/decrement or pointer arithmetic on them.\n- The statement \"const char *form = cls;\" copies the pointer value into a local variable and does not modify the parameter cls.\n- Calls that pass parameters (add_session_cookie(session, ...), MHD_add_response_header(..., mime), MHD_queue_response(connection, ...)) pass the parameter values to other functions but do not modify the parameter variables within this function. Modifying the object pointed to (e.g., via session) is allowed by Rule 17.8; the rule only forbids changing the parameter variables themselves.\n- The cast to (const void *) form when calling MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static does not modify cls or form.\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no fragments requiring further investigation under that rule."
