Unless add_session_cookie requires a mutable pointer, session could and should be declared 'const struct Session *session'. Therefore the code as shown violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is incomplete. MISRA R8.13 does encourage making pointer targets const where possible, and inside serve_simple_form the function does not itself modify *session. However serve_simple_form forwards session unchanged to add_session_cookie(session, response). Whether session can be declared const here depends on the signature and semantics of add_session_cookie (and any other callers): if add_session_cookie is declared to take struct Session * and/or it mutates the session, you cannot change the parameter to const without changing that API. The agent A did not show the prototype or behavior of add_session_cookie, so you cannot conclude a violation from the code shown alone. To determine a real violation, inspect add_session_cookie and other call sites; only if none require a mutable session should serve_simple_form change the parameter to const. Therefore the report as given is not proven correct."
