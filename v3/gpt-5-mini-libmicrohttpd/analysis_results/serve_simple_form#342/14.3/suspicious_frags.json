  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional statements are:\n- if (NULL == response)\n- if (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(response, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_ENCODING, mime))\nBoth depend on runtime results: MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static may return NULL at runtime, and MHD_add_response_header is a function call that returns a status at runtime. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions. The code does not contain any constant boolean/invariant expressions or literal constants used as loop/if conditions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for this rule."
