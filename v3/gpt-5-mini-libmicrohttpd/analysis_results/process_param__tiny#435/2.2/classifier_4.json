  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__tiny:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__tiny (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.large)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-L' or '--large'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.tiny = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.tiny = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown context: the assignment sets the tiny flag (tool_params.tiny = !0; i.e. 1) and therefore changes program state that is normally observed later. Removing it would change behaviour unless the flag is never read or is always overwritten before any read. A specific violation scenario would be: tool_params.tiny is never accessed after this assignment (no reads anywhere in the program) or is unconditionally overwritten before any read \u2014 in that case the assignment would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
