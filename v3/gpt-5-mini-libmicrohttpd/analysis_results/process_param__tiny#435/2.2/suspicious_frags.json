Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are syntactic (function signature, braces, parameter declaration) or are parts of the already-listed statements and do not constitute additional executed operations that could be removed without changing behaviour. The three if-blocks, the assignment to tool_params.tiny, and the final return expression are the only operations whose removal might not affect program behaviour (e.g. if mutual-exclusion is guaranteed elsewhere, tiny is already set, or param_name[1] has a constant value). No other code in this function appears to be dead code or warrants separate investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
