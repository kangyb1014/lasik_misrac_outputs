  "explanation": "The provided code contains a single function, process_param__tiny. It does not call itself directly, nor does it call any other user-defined functions that could call back into it. The only function calls present are to fprintf (standard library), which is not expected to invoke user callbacks or cause indirect recursion here. There are no function pointers, no macro-expanded calls, and no other fragments in the snippet that could create indirect recursion. The ternary expression in the return is selecting enum constants, not invoking functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
