  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (the if checks on tool_params.empty/medium/large and the assignment tool_params.tiny = ! 0) do not perform any string handling, pointer arithmetic, indexing into character arrays, or calls to the <string.h> API, so they are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17. The only places that read from or pass the param_name string (the three fprintf calls and the param_name[1] index) are listed above and should be investigated for possible null or out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. No other code in this function uses string handling or could violate the stated rule."
