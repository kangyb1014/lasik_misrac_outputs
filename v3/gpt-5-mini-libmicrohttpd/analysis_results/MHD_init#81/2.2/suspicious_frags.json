  "explanation": "I flagged code fragments that are potentially redundant, have always-true conditions, ignore return values, or may have no observable effect and therefore merit investigation for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other parts of the function (WSAStartup and its error checks, the winsock-related declarations under MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, the nested preprocessor conditionals selecting different library/initialisation paths, and the MHD_PANIC calls tied to error checks) are explicit initialization or error-handling operations and are guarded by compile-time macros or visibly have side effects; removing them would likely change program behaviour, so they are not reported as suspicious. The conditional compilation blocks themselves are not dead code per se \u2014 they select platform-specific code depending on build configuration \u2014 so they do not need further investigation here."
