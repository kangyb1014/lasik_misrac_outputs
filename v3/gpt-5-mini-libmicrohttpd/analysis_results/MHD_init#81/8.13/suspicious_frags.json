  "explanation": "All other lines in the function either do not involve pointer values or involve uses where const-qualification is unlikely to apply (e.g. local variable declarations, calls to initialization routines without pointer parameters, asserts checking sizeof, preprocessor conditionals, and function calls that do not pass pointer arguments). Those fragments therefore do not present potential violations of Rule 8.13 and do not need further investigation in this context."
