  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided MHD_init implementation. The code only invokes initialization functions (WSAStartup, gcry_check_version, gnutls_global_init, MHD_* helpers), uses conditionals, assertions and string literals. The multi-line string literal in the MHD_PANIC call is formed by compile-time concatenation and does not involve runtime string handling functions. There are also no pointer parameters referencing object buffers that are passed to any string-handling routine in this fragment. Therefore there are no code locations here that fall under Rule 21.17 and nothing in this fragment needs further investigation for out-of-bounds accesses via <string.h> functions."
