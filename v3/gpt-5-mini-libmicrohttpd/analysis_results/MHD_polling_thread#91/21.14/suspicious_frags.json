  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided function. The code only performs integer comparisons (e.g. checking return values against 0), calls signal/thread API functions, and calls internal MHD_* helper functions. There are no calls that compare null-terminated strings via memcmp in this fragment, nor any direct use of other string-comparison functions in a manner that would violate Rule 21.14. (If callers or implementations of the invoked helpers are of concern, they are outside the provided code and would need separate inspection.)"
