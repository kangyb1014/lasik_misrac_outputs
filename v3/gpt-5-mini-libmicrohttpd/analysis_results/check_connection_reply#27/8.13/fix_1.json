  "explanation": "The compilation error was caused by defining the helper function probe_log_connection_reply inside check_connection_reply (nested functions are not allowed in standard C). I moved probe_log_connection_reply to file scope (above check_connection_reply). To make this translation unit self-contained and compileable I added minimal type definitions for struct MHD_Connection and struct MHD_Response, a constant for MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, and function prototypes for external helpers (mhd_assert, MHD_DLOG, and _). No function implementations or macros were added beyond what was necessary to allow compilation; the original logic of check_connection_reply and the logging helper are preserved."
