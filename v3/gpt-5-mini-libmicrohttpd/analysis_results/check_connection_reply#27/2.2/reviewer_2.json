It has no side-effects and removing it would not change program behaviour (timing or observable effects) in this context, so it constitutes dead code.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The two lines \u201c(void) c;\u201d and \u201c(void) r;\u201d are expression statements that do nothing observable at runtime (no side\u2011effects). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. These statements are executed (syntactically present as statements) and their removal would not change the program\u2019s functional behaviour in this context (they exist solely to suppress unused\u2011variable warnings), therefore they meet the definition of dead code. Note: one can argue timing effects in extremely timing\u2011sensitive embedded contexts, but nothing in the presented code indicates a required timing side\u2011effect from these no\u2011ops; the intent is clearly to silence compiler warnings. Consequently Agent A\u2019s report is correct."
