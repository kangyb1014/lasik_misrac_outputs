  "explanation": "Fragments not reported as suspicious: the alias initializations (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; and struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;) are variable initializations \u2014 per the MISRA note initialization is not the same as an assignment and therefore not a candidate for dead code. The code inside the #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES (the checks of r->total_size and r->flags_auto and the MHD_DLOG calls) have observable side effects (logging) when compiled in and thus must be investigated separately; they are not obviously dead. The conditional compilation means only one branch is present in a given build; the presence of meaningful checks and logging in the HAVE_MESSAGES branch and the explicit compiler-warning suppression in the else branch are build-dependent and need different consideration. Unreachable code is not present. The listed suspicious lines are executed operations that appear to have no runtime effect (the assert macro may expand to a no-op in some builds; the (void) casts are no-op operations present solely to silence compiler warnings) and therefore should be investigated for possible dead-code violations."
