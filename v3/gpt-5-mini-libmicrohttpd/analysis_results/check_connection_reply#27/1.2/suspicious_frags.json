  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. I inspected for common compiler extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, and none are present: there are no instances of __attribute__ or other double-underscore attributes, no __asm or inline assembly, no GCC/Clang statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no typeof, no labels-as-values (&&label), no nested functions, no binary/hex float literals or case ranges, no use of compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __inline, __extension__), and no Microsoft-specific extensions. The Doxygen-style comment token (/**< ... */) is a standard C comment form and not a compiler language extension. The use of the _(...) macro, mhd_assert, or (void) casts are macros or standard idioms, not language extensions in the source shown. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 1.2."
