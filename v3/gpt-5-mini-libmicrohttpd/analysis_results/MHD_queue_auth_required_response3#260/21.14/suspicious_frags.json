  "explanation": "No use of memcmp appears in this code fragment. The function body contains only: local variable declarations, initialization (buf_ptr = NULL), calls to digest_setup_zero, queue_auth_required_response3_inner, digest_deinit, a NULL check and free(buf_ptr), and a return. There are no string comparisons, no calls to memcmp, and no indirect use of memcmp within the shown lines. The only call that might conceivably use memcmp is queue_auth_required_response3_inner, but that function\u2019s implementation is not present in this fragment and therefore cannot be flagged here. For the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings), there are no suspicious code fragments in the provided code to investigate."
