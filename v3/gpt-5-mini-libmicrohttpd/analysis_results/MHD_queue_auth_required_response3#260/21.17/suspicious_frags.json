  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not pass pointers to routines that commonly perform string/memory operations nor themselves invoke <string.h> functions. Specifically: the function signature, local declarations such as 'struct DigestAlgorithm da;' and 'enum MHD_Result ret;', the return statement 'return ret;', and the surrounding braces/boilerplate do not perform or propagate string handling. The only calls and pointer manipulations that can lead to potential out-of-bounds accesses by standard string functions are the ones included above (initialization of the buffer pointer, passing pointers/objects to helper routines, and the cleanup/free of the buffer). These are the places that must be inspected to ensure any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strcmp/strspn (etc.) inside the called functions cannot access beyond object bounds."
