In that case the parameter should be 'const struct MHD_Response *response'.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not provably correct from the supplied snippet. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 asks that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. Whether the code violates that rule depends on the complete program: specifically whether MHD_queue_auth_required_response3 or any function it calls (queue_auth_required_response3_inner or further callees) ever modify the MHD_Response object. In the snippet shown the response pointer is forwarded to queue_auth_required_response3_inner; since we do not have the implementation of that function (or other call sites), we cannot determine whether the pointee is actually unmodified. If indeed neither this function nor any callee modifies the response object, then the parameter should be declared const and the report would be correct. But as presented, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a violation. Also note practical constraints: changing the outer function alone is insufficient if inner functions or API contracts expect a non-const pointer \u2014 the whole API must be reviewed/updated."
