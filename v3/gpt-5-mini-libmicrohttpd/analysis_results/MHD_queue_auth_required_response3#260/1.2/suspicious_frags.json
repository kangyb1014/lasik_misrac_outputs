  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided snippet. Items examined and why they are not flagged:\n- _MHD_EXTERN: this is a macro name only. The source shown does not contain any compiler-specific keyword or attribute (for example __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__, typeof, asm, statement-expressions ({ ... }) or other documented compiler extensions). Without the macro definition, it is not possible to determine that a compiler extension is actually used, so it is not reported here.\n- enum and struct usage (enum MHD_Result, enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiQOP, enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3, struct MHD_Connection, struct MHD_Response, struct DigestAlgorithm): all are standard C constructs.\n- Standard library identifiers and functions (NULL, free, char *, pointers, function calls): standard C, not extensions.\n- Control flow and function return: standard C.\n\nIf the _MHD_EXTERN macro expands (in included headers or compiler command-line) to a compiler-specific extension (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)), that expansion would need to be inspected; based solely on the shown code there is no guaranteed use of a documented compiler language extension, so no fragments are reported."
