  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body and found no for statements or loop-like constructs to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 would apply. The function only declares local variables, initializes buf_ptr to NULL, calls digest_setup_zero, calls queue_auth_required_response3_inner, calls digest_deinit, conditionally frees buf_ptr, and returns ret. There are no for loops (no first/second/third clauses, no loop counters, no loop control flags) within this snippet. The only macros/identifiers at function scope are _MHD_EXTERN and type names (enum/struct), which are not loop constructs and do not introduce for statements here. While called functions (e.g. queue_auth_required_response3_inner) may contain for loops, those loops are outside the provided code fragment and therefore not part of this review. For these reasons there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation for compliance with Rule 14.2."
