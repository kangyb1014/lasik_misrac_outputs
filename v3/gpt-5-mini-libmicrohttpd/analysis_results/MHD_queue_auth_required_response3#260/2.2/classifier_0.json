  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_queue_auth_required_response3:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_queue_auth_required_response3 (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                                   const char *realm,\n                                   const char *opaque,\n                                   const char *domain,\n                                   struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                   int signal_stale,\n                                   enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiQOP mqop,\n                                   enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3 malgo3,\n                                   int userhash_support,\n                                   int prefer_utf8)\n{\n  struct DigestAlgorithm da;\n  char *buf_ptr;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  buf_ptr = NULL;\n  digest_setup_zero (&da);\n  ret = queue_auth_required_response3_inner (connection,\n                                             realm,\n                                             opaque,\n                                             domain,\n                                             response,\n                                             signal_stale,\n                                             mqop,\n                                             malgo3,\n                                             userhash_support,\n                                             prefer_utf8,\n                                             &buf_ptr,\n                                             &da);\n  digest_deinit (&da);\n  if (NULL != buf_ptr)\n    free (buf_ptr);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigest_setup_zero (&da);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call digest_setup_zero(&da) initializes the local struct 'da' before it is passed by address to queue_auth_required_response3_inner and later to digest_deinit. Removing this call would likely leave 'da' uninitialized, which can change program behaviour (e.g. causing undefined behaviour or a crash when digest_deinit or the inner function access members), so the operation is not dead code."
