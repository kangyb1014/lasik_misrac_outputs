  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected. The function contains a straight-line control flow: declarations, buf_ptr initialization, digest_setup_zero(&da), a call to queue_auth_required_response3_inner that returns into ret, digest_deinit(&da), an if (NULL != buf_ptr) free(buf_ptr), and return ret. There are no constant-condition branches, no unconditional returns/gotos/loops that would skip subsequent statements, and no code following an unconditional transfer-of-control. The conditional free is reachable depending on buf_ptr set by the inner call. Although the inner function could hypothetically perform a non-local exit (e.g., longjmp or abort), such behavior is not visible in this source and does not create statically unreachable code in this function. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
