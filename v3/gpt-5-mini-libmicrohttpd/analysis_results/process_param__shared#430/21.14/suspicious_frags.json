  "explanation": "No use of memcmp (direct or via an obvious macro) appears in the provided function. The only string/character operations are: 1) fprintf with \"%s\" to print the null-terminated param_name (printing is not string comparison); and 2) the test '-' == param_name[1], which compares a single character element, not whole null-terminated strings or via memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp or other obvious string-comparison library functions in this snippet, so no fragments here need investigation for Rule 21.14. If memcmp is used elsewhere (not shown), those locations should be inspected."
