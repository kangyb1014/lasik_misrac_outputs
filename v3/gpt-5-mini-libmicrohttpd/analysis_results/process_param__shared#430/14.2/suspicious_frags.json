  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and the three clauses that form a for loop. The provided function process_param__shared contains no for statements or any loop constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 that need investigation.\n\nAdditional notes to justify not selecting other fragments:\n- There are no for loops (no loop counters, no first/second/third clauses) anywhere in the function.\n- Calls to fprintf and the return expressions do not constitute loop bodies or affect the requirements of Rule 14.2.\n- The ternary expression and the indexing param_name[1] are not related to for-loop well-formedness and thus are out of scope for Rule 14.2.\n- The assignment tool_params.shared = ! 0 is a boolean assignment, not a loop modification and therefore irrelevant to Rule 14.2.\n\nBecause Rule 14.2 concerns only for loops and none exist in this code, there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation under this rule."
