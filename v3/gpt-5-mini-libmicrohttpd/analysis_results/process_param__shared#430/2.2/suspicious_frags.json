  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Everything in the function that is not listed above was not marked for investigation because it is straightforward control structure or function scaffolding (function header, parameter declaration, braces, and the overall return type) and does not by itself constitute an executed operation that could be removed without changing observable program behaviour. Note also that I have not included unreachable-code concerns (which per the MISRA note are distinct from dead code) or initialization-only constructs. The listed fragments are the places where executed operations might be redundant, have no effect, or otherwise merit inspection for potential dead-code violations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
