  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The fragment does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The call passes an explicit buffer and an explicit length (page_content_len) and there is no direct use of the <string.h> functions in the shown code. The page_content_len is computed from the array size (sizeof(page_content)/sizeof(char) - 1) so the length passed excludes the NUL terminator and matches the actual buffer contents. A possible violation scenario would be external: if MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static were implemented to call a <string.h> function (e.g. strlen/strcpy) that ignores the supplied length and reads past the buffer, that implementation would violate Rule 21.17 \u2014 but that would be a defect in the library function, not in this call site."
