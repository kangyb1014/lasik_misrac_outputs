  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment computes the length of a char array via sizeof(page_content) - 1 (removing the NUL) and does not call any <string.h> functions, so Rule 21.17 is not infringed. A potential violation scenario would be if MAIN_PAGE were not an array (e.g. page_content were a char *), or MAIN_PAGE did not contain a terminating NUL so the computed page_content_len is incorrect; then subsequent use with string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/etc.) could access beyond the object bounds and would violate Rule 21.17."
