  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not perform string handling or buffer-length calculations and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Specifically: the local declarations of resp and ret, the NULL check and early return, the calls to MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response, and the final return statement do not themselves invoke standard <string.h> functions nor perform pointer arithmetic on character buffers. The flagged fragments cover places where a character buffer length is derived and where that buffer (and header strings) are handed off to library functions \u2014 these are the points that must be inspected further (e.g. verify the definition/content of MAIN_PAGE and the behavior of the MHD_* functions) to ensure no out-of-bounds string accesses occur."
