  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. I checked for common non-standard/implementation-specific constructs (and found none):\n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, or __typeof__.\n- No GCC/Clang statement expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions.\n- No inline assembly or other vendor-specific intrinsics.\n- No use of non-standard storage-class or type qualifiers beyond standard C (static, const, enum, struct).\n- The (void) cast of the function return is standard C to explicitly discard a value.\n- Use of sizeof, array declaration with inferred size from initializer, enum types, and pointer usage are all standard C.\n\nThe only identifiers that could be macros or types coming from external libraries (MAIN_PAGE, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_* types/constants) are library symbols; their definitions are not shown. If any of those definitions use compiler extensions, that would need to be inspected in their respective headers/definitions. Based solely on the shown code, there are no language extensions to report."
