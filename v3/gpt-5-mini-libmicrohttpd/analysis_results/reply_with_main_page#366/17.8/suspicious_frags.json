  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies a function parameter. The only parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *c' and it is never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise altered in this function \u2014 it is only passed by value to called functions (MHD_queue_response), which is permitted. Objects modified in this function (resp, page_content, page_content_len) are local variables or static locals, not function parameters. The cast-to-void of MHD_add_response_header only discards the return value and does not modify any parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
