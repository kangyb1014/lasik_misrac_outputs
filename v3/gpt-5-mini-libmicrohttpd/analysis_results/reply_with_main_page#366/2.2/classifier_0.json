  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of reply_with_main_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreply_with_main_page (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  static const char page_content[] = MAIN_PAGE;\n  static const size_t page_content_len =\n    (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n  struct MHD_Response *resp;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  resp = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (page_content_len, page_content)\n  ;\n  if (NULL == resp)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  /* Ignore possible error when adding the header as the reply will work even\n     without this header. */\n  (void) MHD_add_response_header (resp,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                  \"text/html\");\n\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (c, MHD_HTTP_OK, resp);\n  MHD_destroy_response (resp);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nenum MHD_Result ret;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: in the full function 'ret' is assigned with ret = MHD_queue_response(...) and then returned (return ret;), so the declaration is used and not dead. A violation would occur if 'ret' were declared and/or assigned but never used \u2014 for example, declaring 'enum MHD_Result ret;' and later assigning to it but not using or returning it (or removing the return that uses it), which would constitute dead code under Rule 2.2."
