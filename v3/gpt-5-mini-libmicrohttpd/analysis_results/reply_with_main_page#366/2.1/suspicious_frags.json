  "explanation": "I found no fragments that appear to be unreachable code. Reasons: \n- There are no conditional statements with a constant false condition (e.g. if (0)) or similar constructs that would make code unreachable. The only conditional (if (NULL == resp)) leads to a valid early return; the code after it is reachable when resp != NULL.\n- There are no forward gotos, unused labels, dead-case switch constructs, or infinite loops that prevent execution of subsequent code.\n- The standalone semicolon after the resp = ... call is an empty statement, not unreachable code.\n- Static initializers (page_content, page_content_len) are compile-time/data definitions, not runtime unreachable statements.\n- The (void) cast discarding MHD_add_response_header\u2019s return value is an explicit ignore of a function result, not unreachable code.\n- All other statements (queueing the response, destroying it, returning ret) are reachable in the normal control flow.\n\nTherefore no code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this function."
