  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of reply_with_area1_pages:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreply_with_area1_pages (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                        const char *url)\n{\n\n  if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA1_URL \"\"))\n  {\n    static const char page_content[] =\n      \"<html><head><title>Restricted secret page</title></head>\" \\\n      \"<body>Welcome to the restricted area</body></html>\";\n    static const size_t page_content_len =\n      (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n    struct MHD_Response *resp;\n    enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n    resp = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (page_content_len,\n                                                   page_content);\n    if (NULL == resp)\n      return MHD_NO;\n\n    /* Ignore possible error when adding the header as the reply will work even\n       without this header. */\n    (void) MHD_add_response_header (resp, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                    \"text/html\");\n\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (c, MHD_HTTP_OK, resp);\n    MHD_destroy_response (resp);\n    return ret;\n  }\n  /* If needed: add handlers for other URLs in this area */\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA1_URL \"some_path/some_page\"))\n  {\n    /* Add page creation/processing code */\n  }\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n\n  /* The requested URL is unknown */\n  return reply_with_page_not_found (c);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA1_URL \"some_path/some_page\"))\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

Unreachable code is not considered dead code by MISRA Note 2, therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 2.2. (If the block were re-enabled, a further analysis would be needed to check whether the branch body is ever executed and removable.)"
