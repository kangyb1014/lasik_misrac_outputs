  "explanation": "I did not include fragments that do not involve pointer types or that already use const qualification: page_content is declared as static const char[] and page_content_len is declared as static const size_t \u2014 these already satisfy const-qualification concerns. String literals (e.g. \"text/html\") are inherently constant. The strcmp calls use the const-qualified parameter 'url' and constant strings, so they do not raise Rule 8.13 issues. The disabled code is inside #if 0 and therefore not active. Non-pointer declarations (enum, integer types, return statements without pointer use) are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and thus were not included."
