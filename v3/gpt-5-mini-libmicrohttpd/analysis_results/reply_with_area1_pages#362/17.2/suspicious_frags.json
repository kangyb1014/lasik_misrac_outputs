  "explanation": "No direct self-call to reply_with_area1_pages is present in this function. The remaining function calls in the code are to library routines (strcmp, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) and to standard helper functions/objects; these do not appear in this translation unit as user-defined functions that could be inspected for indirect recursion. The disabled #if 0 block is reported because it contains a placeholder for adding handlers (which, if enabled and implemented, could introduce indirect recursion). Other fragments (string literals, static data declarations, and the MHD_* library calls) are not flagged because they are not user-defined functions that could directly or indirectly call reply_with_area1_pages."
