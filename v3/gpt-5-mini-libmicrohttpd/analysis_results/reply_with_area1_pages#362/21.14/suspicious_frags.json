  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code performs string comparisons using strcmp (e.g. if (0 == strcmp (url, SEC_AREA1_URL \"\"))) \u2014 strcmp is the correct standard function for comparing null-terminated C strings and is not prohibited by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The disabled code block also uses strcmp, not memcmp. No other calls or macros in the shown code expand to memcmp, and the MHD_* functions are unrelated library functions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14 in this file."
