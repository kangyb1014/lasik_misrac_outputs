  "explanation": "The only code region that is excluded from compilation and therefore effectively unreachable is the preprocessor-disabled block (#if 0 ... #endif). That disabled block should be investigated because it represents code present in the source that will never be executed in the build as-is.\n\nOther fragments in the function do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the initial if (0 == strcmp(...)) block is a conditional runtime branch (its body is reachable when the URL matches), its internal error-return paths (return MHD_NO) are legitimate error handling and do not make subsequent code unreachable in general, and the final return reply_with_page_not_found(c) is the normal fallback path and reachable when the first condition is not met. The static declarations and header-add/call sequences are standard and reachable within the conditional branch. No other unconditional returns or statements render following code unreachable."
