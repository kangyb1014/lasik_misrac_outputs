  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that are either explicit no-ops ((void)0) or conditional logging/diagnostic and small conditional assignments which can be compiled in or out and therefore are the most likely candidates to be executed without affecting the core behaviour of the daemon. These are the places that merit investigation for potential dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nOther code in the function has clear functional side-effects (socket state changes, nonblocking mode, SIGPIPE suppression attempts, socket close, errno propagation, memcpy into sockaddr_storage, calls to internal_add_connection, connection counting/cleanup, returns, and error handling). Those operations affect program control flow, external I/O, resource state, or error reporting and therefore are not considered dead code for the purpose of Rule 2.2 and do not need to be flagged here. Note also that preprocessor guards change which fragments exist in a particular build; the list above focuses on fragments that are present in the source and are typical candidates for being executed without changing core functionality."
