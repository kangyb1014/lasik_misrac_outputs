  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain no function calls that could create direct or indirect recursion. The branch taken when key == NULL performs only pointer traversal and comparisons with no function calls. The remaining statements are simple pointer checks, assignments, and returns (macros/enum values), none of which can cause a call back to this function. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other invoked functions in the code fragment except the one shown, so no other potential recursion sites exist in this function."
