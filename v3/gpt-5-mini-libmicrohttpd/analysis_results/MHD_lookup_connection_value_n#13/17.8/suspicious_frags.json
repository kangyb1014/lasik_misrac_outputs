  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The only writes are to *value_ptr and *value_size_ptr, which modify the objects pointed to by pointer parameters \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the pointer itself is not modified). The pointer parameters (connection, kind, key, key_size, value_ptr, value_size_ptr) are only read; none are reassigned. All dereferences of pointer parameters are guarded by NULL checks (connection, value_ptr, value_size_ptr), avoiding accidental modification of the parameter itself. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
