  "explanation": "I inspected the rest of the function and found no obvious compiler-specific language extensions. There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__((...)), __declspec(...), __asm, asm(...), typeof, statement-expressions ({: ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&label), or other GCC/Clang/MSVC specific keywords. The remaining constructs are standard C: enums, pointers, size_t, for-loops, pointer comparisons, function calls, and simple bitwise operations. Reserved identifier usage (identifiers beginning with an underscore) is a concern per the C standard but is not itself a compiler language extension and therefore was not flagged here. The only candidate that could map to a compiler-specific linkage/visibility extension is the _MHD_EXTERN token at the function start (it is likely a macro that may expand to a compiler-specific storage-class or attribute); that macro usage is reported for investigation. No other fragments in the provided code contain explicit compiler extensions as documented by common compilers."
