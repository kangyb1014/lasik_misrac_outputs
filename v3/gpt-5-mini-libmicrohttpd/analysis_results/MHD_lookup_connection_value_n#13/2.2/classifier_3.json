Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_lookup_connection_value_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                               enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                               const char *key,\n                               size_t key_size,\n                               const char **value_ptr,\n                               size_t *value_size_ptr)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (NULL == pos->header) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (key_size == pos->header_size) &&\n           ( (key == pos->header) ||\n             (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (key,\n                                             pos->header,\n                                             key_size) ) ) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (NULL == pos)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL != value_ptr)\n    *value_ptr = pos->value;\n\n  if (NULL != value_size_ptr)\n    *value_size_ptr = pos->value_size;\n\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(key_size == pos->header_size)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The expression (key_size == pos->header_size) participates in the conditional that decides whether a header matches the requested key. It is evaluated at runtime and influences control flow: when sizes differ the overall condition is false and the loop continues; removing this test would change matching behaviour (it could allow mismatches or force unnecessary string compares), so the operation is not dead code."
