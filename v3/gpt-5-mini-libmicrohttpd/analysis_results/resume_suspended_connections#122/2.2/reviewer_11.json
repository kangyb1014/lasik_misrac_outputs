True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nWhen the code is built without UPGRADE_SUPPORT, the local variable urh is defined as a static const void *const urh = NULL, so the test if (NULL == urh) is always true. The comparison (and the conditional control) is therefore redundant: removing that if (or the comparison) would not change program behaviour in that configuration. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the usual interpretation of this source. The apparent tautological test when UPGRADE_SUPPORT is not defined (the static const urh = NULL and subsequent if (NULL == urh)) exists solely as a consequence of conditional compilation: the upgrade-path code and the additional urh-based conditions are removed by the preprocessor when UPGRADE_SUPPORT is undefined, and the source keeps a single (compatible) control flow for both configurations. In builds with UPGRADE_SUPPORT the urh variable and the extra conditions are meaningful; in builds without it the test is always true but is a harmless, intended artifact of sharing the same source for both build variants.\n\nMISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code in the built project. If you evaluate a project that is permanently and intentionally built without UPGRADE_SUPPORT and you treat that single build as the whole project, a tool could flag the always-true comparison as redundant. However, the source as written is clearly intended to be portable across configurations and the conditional compilation makes the extra checks necessary for the UPGRADE_SUPPORT-enabled build. Therefore agent A\u2019s blanket claim that this source violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct in the general/intentional multi-configuration context; if your project truly never enables UPGRADE_SUPPORT, you could remove the leftover construct to satisfy Rule 2.2 for that single-configuration project."
