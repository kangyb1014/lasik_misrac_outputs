The literal \"POST\" is safe, but the code does not validate that 'method' is non-NULL and NUL-terminated before calling strcmp, so an invalid or missing method would cause out-of-bounds/undefined reads.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 forbids uses of <string.h> functions that can access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. However, whether a violation actually occurs depends on the provenance and contract of the pointer parameters. In this callback, 'method' is supplied by the HTTP library that invokes ahc_echo; that API documents/provides a valid, NUL\u2011terminated method string (and not NULL). Given that contract, the strcmp calls cannot legally read out of bounds and therefore do not violate Rule 21.17. \n\nNote: If the caller of ahc_echo could legitimately pass NULL or a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffer for 'method' (i.e. if no such guarantee exists), then calling strcmp would indeed be undefined and would violate 21.17. But Agent A\u2019s scenario assumes such an invalid caller; without evidence the API allows that, the code as shown does not demonstrate a Rule 21.17 violation. Also be aware of other potential issues (e.g. use of param->response_page assumes cls/param are valid), but those are separate concerns."
