In the fragment the code merely casts param->response_page to (const void *), which hides the fact that the original pointer is non-const instead of fixing the underlying declaration. The correct action is to declare response_page as pointing to a const-qualified type and pass it without casting.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the described scenario. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In this function the response buffer is passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static as a const void*, which indicates the data is treated as read-only by the callee. If struct handler_param actually declares response_page as a non-const char * (or similar non-const pointer), that declaration fails to reflect the intended constness and thus violates Rule 8.13. Casting param->response_page to (const void *) merely conceals the mismatch instead of correcting it; the proper fix is to declare response_page as const char * (or otherwise const-qualified) and pass it without a cast. (If, however, response_page is already declared const-qualified, there is no violation.)"
