  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they either already use const where appropriate or require non-const access and thus are not candidates for making the pointed-to type const:\n\n- The parameters const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, and const char *upload_data are already const-qualified and therefore need no further investigation for Rule 8.13.\n\n- The function uses the connection handle (struct MHD_Connection *connection) with library calls (e.g. MHD_queue_response). That API likely modifies the connection state; therefore the pointee cannot be made const without checking the API contract \u2014 it is not flagged here as a probable Rule 8.13 violation.\n\n- The pointer upload_data_size (size_t *upload_data_size) is unused in this function, but its semantics are commonly to allow the caller or library to read or write the size; making it const may be incompatible with the API. It should be inspected with the API context before changing qualification, so it was not flagged as an obvious candidate.\n\n- The code assigns to *req_cls (setting it to &aptr and later NULL); because the function intentionally modifies the object pointed to by req_cls, the pointed-to type cannot be const. The assignments themselves are included in suspicious_frags so callers can inspect whether the pointer-to-pointer type is appropriate.\n\n- Other local uses and casts (e.g. casts to (const void *)) are present; those were only flagged where they reveal that non-const data (BUSYPAGE, param->response_page, cls/param) is passed to APIs expecting const pointers, which suggests the original declarations might be missing const qualification and therefore warrant investigation.\n\nIf further context (definitions of struct handler_param, BUSYPAGE, and the surrounding API signatures) is provided, the listed fragments should be re-evaluated to determine whether the pointee types can and should be const-qualified to conform to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
