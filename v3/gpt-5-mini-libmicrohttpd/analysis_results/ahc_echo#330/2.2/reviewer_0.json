  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statements of the form (void) upload_data; are intentionally placed to indicate an unused parameter and to silence compiler warnings; they perform no side\u2011effects and do not constitute operational dead code in the sense targeted by MISRA Rule 2.2. Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; a cast-to-void expression is a no-op used as documentation/annotation and does not represent leftover, unreachable, or redundant algorithmic code that could confuse maintenance. In practice compilers treat these as no-ops and they are a conventional, acceptable way to mark unused parameters rather than a bug in the code. Therefore the claimed violation is incorrect (no Rule 2.2 breach)."
