  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the fragment as written. The conditional block guarded by HAVE_MESSAGES is compiled in only when that macro is defined and the following return is reached at run-time after MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_. This code is reachable unless an earlier return is provably always taken. A specific violation scenario would be if the earlier test (if (0 <= connection->daemon->client_discipline) return ...) is provably always true (for example client_discipline is a compile-time constant or invariant that is always >= 0). In that case the assignment to res and the subsequent code would be unreachable, violating Rule 2.1."
