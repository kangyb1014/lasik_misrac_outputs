  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of unescape_wrapper:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nunescape_wrapper (void *cls,\n                  struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  char *val)\n{\n  bool broken;\n  size_t res;\n  (void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n\n  /* TODO: add individual parameter */\n  if (0 <= connection->daemon->client_discipline)\n    return MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ (val);\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (val, &broken);\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The URL encoding is broken.\\n\"));\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n  return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The URL encoding is broken.\\n\"));\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in general: the fragment is compiled only when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined and executes only when 'broken' is true (set by the decode function). The logging call produces observable side-effects (messages, I/O and potentially timing), so removing it would change program behaviour; therefore it is not dead code. (It would only be a violation if there is evidence that the condition can never be true or that MHD_DLOG/_(...) expand to a no-op so the statement is executed but guaranteed to have no effect.)"
