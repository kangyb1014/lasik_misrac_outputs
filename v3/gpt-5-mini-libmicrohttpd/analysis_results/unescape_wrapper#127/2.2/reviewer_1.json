  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u201c(void) cls;\u201d is the standard idiom to mark an otherwise-unused parameter as intentionally used; it evaluates the parameter and thus is not simply meaningless text. Under the rule wording and its notes, this expression is a deliberate use (it prevents an \u2018\u2018unused parameter\u2019\u2019 diagnostic and documents intent), and its removal can change observable behaviour (for example by changing timing or by removing an evaluation that could matter if the operand had volatile semantics). Consequently it is not an instance of dead code as intended by MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the violation report is incorrect."
