  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned or otherwise modified in this function. Analysis by parameter:\n- cls: only used in the idiom (void) cls; to suppress an unused-parameter warning \u2014 this does not modify the parameter.\n- connection: only read (accessing connection->daemon->client_discipline and passing connection to MHD_DLOG). There is no assignment to connection or to any of the pointer parameters themselves.\n- val: passed to MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ and MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_. Those functions\u2019 names indicate they may modify the object pointed to by val (in-place decoding). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; what is forbidden is modifying the pointer variable itself (e.g., reassigning val), which does not occur here.\nOther local variables (broken, res) are local and not function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no fragments require investigation under that rule."
