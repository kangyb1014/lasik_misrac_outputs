  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 because they are not function calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion: the function signature and storage class (static) merely declare the function; the local variable declarations (bool broken; size_t res;) and the cast (void) cls; are simple definitions/expressions; the conditional check (if (0 <= connection->daemon->client_discipline)) is a data access and comparison, not a function call; the #ifdef / #endif guard and the surrounding return res; are control flow and return statements. The three code fragments listed are the only expressions in this function that invoke other functions/macros and therefore are the relevant places to investigate for potential direct or indirect calls back to unescape_wrapper."
