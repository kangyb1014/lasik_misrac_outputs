  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions that are invariant. The two flagged fragments contain controlling expressions (the first if uses connection->daemon->client_discipline, the second if uses the variable 'broken') that should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant in this context. No other selection or iteration statements in the function use constant or otherwise clearly invariant controlling expressions: there are no while/do-while/for loops, no 'if (0)' / 'if (1)' constructs, and no do-while with an integer constant expression that would fall under the listed exceptions. The (void) cls; statement and the return statements are not controlling expressions. Preprocessor conditional #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES is a compile-time conditional, not a C-level controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3, so it is not flagged here."
