Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return value_res;",
    "tool_params.timeout = param_value;",
    "if (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR == value_res)\n    return value_res;"
  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments need not be investigated for dead code: the function signature and parameter list are required for linkage and are used by callers; the local declarations (unsigned int param_value; enum PerfRepl_param_result value_res;) are referenced later; the call to get_param_value (value_res = get_param_value (... &param_value);) clearly produces a return value and writes to param_value, so it has observable effects and is not dead. Therefore only the listed fragments have a plausible potential to be removable without changing observable behaviour (e.g. if certain return values can never occur, or if tool_params.timeout is never read), and should be investigated further."
