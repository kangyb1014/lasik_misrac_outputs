  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__timeout:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__timeout (const char *param_name, const char *param_tail,\n                        const char *next_param)\n{\n  unsigned int param_value;\n  enum PerfRepl_param_result value_res;\n\n  value_res = get_param_value (param_name, param_tail, next_param,\n                               &param_value);\n  if (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR == value_res)\n    return value_res;\n\n  tool_params.timeout = param_value;\n  return value_res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.timeout = param_value;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment can be dead code if the stored value is never observed (read) or is overwritten before any read. For example, if elsewhere in the project tool_params.timeout is never referenced, or every caller overwrites tool_params.timeout after calling process_param__timeout and before any use, then removing the assignment would not affect program behaviour \u2014 thus it would violate Rule 2.2. Detect by searching for reads of tool_params.timeout (or by confirming it is always overwritten before use)."
