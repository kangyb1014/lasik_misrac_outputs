  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function is provably unreachable from the local source shown. Reasoning:\n- The function contains a single call to get_param_value, then a conditional check on its result. The two code paths (the if branch returning on PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR and the subsequent assignment/return for the non-error case) are determined by the runtime value returned by get_param_value; neither branch is a compile-time constant or otherwise syntactically impossible. \n- There are no constant-condition if/while/switch statements, no labels that are never referenced, no code present after an unconditional return, and no dead-case fall-throughs within this fragment.\n- The only way either branch would be unreachable is if get_param_value is proven (project-wide) to always return a single constant value. That is an interprocedural property not visible in this snippet; it is not provable from this function alone and therefore does not make any local code fragment demonstrably unreachable.\n\nTherefore no local code lines need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 based solely on the provided function."
