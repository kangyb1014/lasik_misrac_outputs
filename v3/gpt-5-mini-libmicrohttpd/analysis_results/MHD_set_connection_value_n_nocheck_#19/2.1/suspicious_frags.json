  "explanation": "I found no unreachable code fragments in the function. Rationale: the only early return is the NULL allocation check (if NULL == pos) return MHD_NO; that branch is reachable if memory allocation fails. The remainder of the function is the path taken when allocation succeeds. The conditional that appends the new header (if (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail) { ... } else { ... }) has two mutually exclusive branches that are both potentially reachable depending on the runtime state of connection->rq.headers_received_tail, so neither branch is statically unreachable. There are no constant-conditional statements, no labels/goto or code placed after an unconditional return in the same execution path, and no dead switch/case or unreachable loop bodies. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
