  "explanation": "I examined the function for compiler-specific language extensions. The code uses only standard C constructs: function declaration with standard storage-class specifier (static), standard enums and structs, pointer usage, sizeof, NULL, and standard comments. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, pragma with compiler-specific directives, or other implementation-defined keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. (Note: other non-extension issues such as the apparent use of a different struct type in sizeof vs the pointer type are not language extensions and so are not flagged here.)"
