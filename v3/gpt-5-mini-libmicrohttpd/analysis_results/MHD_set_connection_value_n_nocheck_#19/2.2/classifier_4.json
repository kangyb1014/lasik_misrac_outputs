Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                                     enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                                     const char *key,\n                                     size_t key_size,\n                                     const char *value,\n                                     size_t value_size)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  pos = MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection,\n                                      sizeof (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header));\n  if (NULL == pos)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  pos->header = key;\n  pos->header_size = key_size;\n  pos->value = value;\n  pos->value_size = value_size;\n  pos->kind = kind;\n  pos->next = NULL;\n  /* append 'pos' to the linked list of headers */\n  if (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail)\n  {\n    connection->rq.headers_received = pos;\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail = pos;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail->next = pos;\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail = pos;\n  }\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer variable 'pos' is used later in the function (assigned from MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ and subsequently referenced), so its declaration is necessary. Also, a plain declaration with no initializer is not an executed operation \u2014 MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns executed dead code. If 'pos' were declared but never used (or its assignments/executions had no effect), that would be a violation, but that's not the case here."
