Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                                     enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                                     const char *key,\n                                     size_t key_size,\n                                     const char *value,\n                                     size_t value_size)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  pos = MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection,\n                                      sizeof (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header));\n  if (NULL == pos)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  pos->header = key;\n  pos->header_size = key_size;\n  pos->value = value;\n  pos->value_size = value_size;\n  pos->kind = kind;\n  pos->next = NULL;\n  /* append 'pos' to the linked list of headers */\n  if (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail)\n  {\n    connection->rq.headers_received = pos;\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail = pos;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail->next = pos;\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail = pos;\n  }\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  pos->value = value;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment pos->value = value stores the header value pointer into the newly allocated header node which is appended to connection->rq.headers_received and will affect later behaviour when headers are read. It is therefore not dead in the shown context. A concrete violation would require that the stored field is never read (or is overwritten before any use) \u2014 e.g. if no code ever inspects connection->rq.headers_received->value or if another assignment to pos->value always happens before any read, then the original assignment would be dead code and removable."
