  "scenario": "This single assignment does not itself call any <string.h> functions, so it does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation would occur later if key_size is greater than the actual size of the object pointed to by key and that pair (pos->header, pos->header_size) is passed to a string handling function. For example, if elsewhere the code does memcpy(dest, pos->header, pos->header_size) or memcmp(pos->header, other, pos->header_size) while the object pointed to by pos->header is smaller than pos->header_size, that would breach Rule 21.17."
