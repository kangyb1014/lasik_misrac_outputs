The listed fragments should be investigated because they affect how string/buffer data and sizes are stored and how much memory is allocated (including a suspicious sizeof(...) choice). Other lines in the function \u2014 initial return-on-NULL, pos->kind/pos->next assignments, and the linked-list append logic (connection->rq.headers_received*, tail updates, and the final return) \u2014 do not perform string handling or buffer copying themselves and therefore do not directly relate to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated for this specific rule."
