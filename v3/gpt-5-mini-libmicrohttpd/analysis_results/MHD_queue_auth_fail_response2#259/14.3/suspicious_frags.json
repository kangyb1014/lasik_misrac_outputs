  "explanation": "The only controlling structures are the if / else if chain: each condition compares a compile-time enum constant (e.g. MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) with the function parameter 'algo'. Because 'algo' is a runtime parameter, those controlling expressions are not invariant and do not violate Rule 14.3. There are no loops or do-while constructs in this function; the return statement and the final function call are not controlling expressions. Therefore no code fragments here need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
