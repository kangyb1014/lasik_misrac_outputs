  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loop constructs are present in the provided code fragment. Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements (their three clauses and the single loop counter requirement). The function body contains an if/else ladder, assignments to a local enum, a macro call (MHD_PANIC) and a call to MHD_queue_auth_required_response3, but no 'for' statements (nor any while/do-while loops) to inspect for the well-formedness requirements of Rule 14.2. Macro expansions are not provided; if those macro definitions contain for loops, supply their definitions for review. Based on the supplied code alone, there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 to investigate."
