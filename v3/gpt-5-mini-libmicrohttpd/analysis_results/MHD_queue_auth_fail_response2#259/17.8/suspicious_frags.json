  "explanation": "I found no code fragment in the function that modifies any function parameter. Analysis by parameter:\n- connection (struct MHD_Connection *): only passed to MHD_queue_auth_required_response3; the pointer variable is not assigned to or modified in this function.\n- realm (const char *): only passed through and compared/used as an argument; not assigned or modified.\n- opaque (const char *): only passed through as an argument; not assigned or modified.\n- response (struct MHD_Response *): only passed through as an argument; the pointer variable itself is not modified in this function (no assignment to response, no dereference-based modification here).\n- signal_stale (int): used only as an argument; not assigned or modified.\n- algo (enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgorithm): only compared in if/else-if branches; not assigned to or modified.\n\nThe only assignments are to the local variable algo3, which is not a function parameter. The call to MHD_PANIC does not modify any parameter in this function. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
