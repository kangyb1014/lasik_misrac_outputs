  "explanation": "The fragments above are selected because they contain control-flow and condition combinations that can make code paths effectively unreachable or rely on implicit relationships between variables that should be validated (for example: the relationship between c->state and the assertions, the HTTP_VER_LEN check when get_request_line_inner() reports an incomplete line, and the interaction of wsp_in_uri and wsp_in_uri_keep with num_ws_in_uri). These locations should be inspected to ensure no code is logically impossible to reach under any valid program state.\n\nOther parts of the function were not selected because they are simple straight-line code or obvious returns (final state assignment and return true, simple transmit/send calls guarded by the conditions above, and the top-level boolean computations of wsp_in_uri/wsp_in_uri_keep themselves are simple evaluations rather than dead code). Assertions alone were flagged only where they are adjacent to a conditional that could make the asserted condition impossible; isolated asserts or simple assignments that do not create unreachable branches were not included to avoid false positives."
