  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect recursion. Only function calls (including macro-invoked functions) can introduce direct or indirect calls back to get_request_line. The fragments selected are every function/macro call site present in this function: the call to get_request_line_inner, the two calls to transmit_error_response_static, the call to send_redirect_fixed_rq_target, the call to process_request_target, and all mhd_assert invocations (assert macros can expand to function-like behaviour). Other parts of the code (variable declarations/initialisations, boolean expressions, pointer arithmetic, comparisons, assignments, state updates, and return statements) do not themselves perform calls and therefore cannot directly cause recursion; they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 in this context. No other function-call expressions are present in the provided code fragment."
