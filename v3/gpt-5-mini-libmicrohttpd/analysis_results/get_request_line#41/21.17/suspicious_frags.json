  "explanation": "I found no direct uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in this function body. The only lines that can lead to out-of-bounds string handling are: (a) the pointer/length arithmetic that computes a length using c->rq.version and c->read_buffer (the HTTP_VER_LEN comparison), and (b) calls into other functions (get_request_line_inner, process_request_target, transmit_error_response_static, send_redirect_fixed_rq_target) that may operate on buffers or use string.h routines internally. I therefore flagged the exact conditional block performing the pointer arithmetic, the related asserts that document buffer/pointer state, the branches that call the other functions, and the call to process_request_target. All other lines in this function are simple control flow or boolean flag checks and do not perform pointer arithmetic or pass buffer pointers/lengths to string routines, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 in the context of this function."
