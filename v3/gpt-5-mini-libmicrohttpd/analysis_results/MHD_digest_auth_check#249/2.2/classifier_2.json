  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_digest_auth_check:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_digest_auth_check (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       const char *realm,\n                       const char *username,\n                       const char *password,\n                       unsigned int nonce_timeout)\n{\n  return MHD_digest_auth_check2 (connection,\n                                 realm,\n                                 username,\n                                 password,\n                                 nonce_timeout,\n                                 MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_digest_auth_check (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       const char *realm,\n                       const char *username,\n                       const char *password,\n                       unsigned int nonce_timeout)\n{\n  return MHD_digest_auth_check2 (connection,\n                                 realm,\n                                 username,\n                                 password,\n                                 nonce_timeout,\n                                 MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "This function is a simple wrapper that forwards its arguments to MHD_digest_auth_check2 with a fixed algorithm parameter (MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) and returns that result. As written it is not dead code because it performs a visible operation (a function call) and removing it would change program behaviour for any callers that use MHD_digest_auth_check (e.g. breaking linkage or changing call sites). However, if the symbol MHD_digest_auth_check is never referenced anywhere in the entire project (no internal calls, not exported/used by other modules or external code), then it would be dead code \u2014 in that specific scenario its removal would not affect program behaviour."
