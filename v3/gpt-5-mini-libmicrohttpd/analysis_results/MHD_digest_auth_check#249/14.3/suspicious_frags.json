  "explanation": "The function contains no controlling expressions (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional operator) \u2014 it consists solely of a single return statement that forwards its parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in loops/conditionals; there are none in this code fragment. The only operations are parameter passing and function call; any controlling expressions would be inside MHD_digest_auth_check2 or other code not shown here, and therefore are out of scope for this fragment."
