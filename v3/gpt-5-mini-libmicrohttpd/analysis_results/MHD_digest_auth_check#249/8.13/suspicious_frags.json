  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter in this snippet that is not const-qualified is the connection parameter. According to Rule 8.13, this should be reviewed to determine whether the function (and the called function MHD_digest_auth_check2) modify the pointed-to object; if not, it should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type. The other pointer parameters (realm, username, password) are already declared as const char * and therefore need no further investigation here. The return type and the literal/enum argument MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 are not pointer types and are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
