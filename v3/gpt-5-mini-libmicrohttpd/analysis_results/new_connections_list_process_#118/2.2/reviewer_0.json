It performs no observable action and can be removed without changing program behaviour (especially when HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined, the cast-to-void is the only statement in the block). Therefore it is an executed no-op and constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. When HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined the if-body reduces to a single statement (void)0; \u2014 an executed no-op expression-statement. Removing that statement does not change program behaviour (no side-effects, no observable timing or state change required by the code), so it is an operation that is executed but redundant and therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The original presence of the cast-to-void is likely intended to suppress compiler warnings about an empty block, but that does not prevent it from being dead code per Rule 2.2.)"
