According to Rule 2.2 this constitutes dead code because it performs no action that affects program state or observable behaviour.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) local_head; line is an explicit use of the variable to suppress a compiler \"unused variable\" diagnostic \u2014 a common idiom \u2014 and is not introducing any behaviourally relevant operation. MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns dead code whose removal would change the program behaviour; a void-cast has no runtime effect. In practice such casts are used to cope with different build configurations (e.g. DLL_remove may or may not reference its first parameter depending on macros) and thus can be required to avoid spurious diagnostics. Removing that statement does not change program behaviour, but its presence is an intentional, non-functional annotation rather than a logic error that Rule 2.2 aims to prevent. Therefore Agent A's claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
