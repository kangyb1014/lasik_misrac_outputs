  "explanation": "Other code fragments need not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because they perform observable effects or control program behaviour: - The mutex operations (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_/MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_) affect concurrency and are not removable. - Assignments to daemon->new_connections_head, daemon->new_connections_tail and daemon->have_new change shared state and therefore affect behaviour. - The DLL_remove(...) call updates the local linked-list pointers (side effects required for correct processing). - The call new_connection_process_(daemon, c) may have side effects and its result affects control flow. - The conditional and do/while loop control the processing sequence and are reachable and effectful. - mhd_assert(...) invocations can influence debug behaviour (and may be macros with effects in some builds). - The logging call (MHD_DLOG(...)) is an observable side-effect when enabled via HAVE_MESSAGES. The only statements that are pure no-ops (executed but having no effect if removed) are the explicit void-cast statements listed above; all other statements either produce side effects, affect control flow, or are necessary for correct concurrent/list handling."
