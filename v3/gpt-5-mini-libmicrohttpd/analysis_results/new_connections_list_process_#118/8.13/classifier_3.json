  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The (void) local_head; statement merely suppresses an unused-variable warning and does not change pointer qualification. In this function local_head is assigned from daemon->new_connections_head and later passed to DLL_remove (which removes/modifies list nodes), so the pointed-to objects are mutable and the pointer cannot/should not be const-qualified. If the pointer were only used for read-only access, MISRA\u00a0C\u00a02023 Rule\u00a08.13 would suggest using a pointer to a const-qualified type, but that is not applicable here."
