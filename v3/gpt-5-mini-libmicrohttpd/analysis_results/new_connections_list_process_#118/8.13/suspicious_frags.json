  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 8.13 concern is whether pointer types could (and should) be to const-qualified pointees. I selected every place where pointers to the daemon or connection structures are declared, assigned, passed, or otherwise used, because those are the locations that could potentially be changed to point-to-const types or must be confirmed to require mutability. Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for this rule: they either manipulate non-pointer data (flags like daemon->have_new), are logging/assert statements, or involve operations that clearly modify the pointed-to objects (e.g. setting daemon->new_connections_head/tail to NULL, locking/unlocking the mutex, and invoking DLL_remove which updates the linked-list structure). Because the function explicitly updates daemon fields and removes/updates list nodes, the corresponding pointees are likely intentionally mutable and therefore not candidates for const-qualification; those lines were not included in the suspicious list. The listed fragments capture all pointer declarations/usages that require review to determine whether the pointee could be const."
