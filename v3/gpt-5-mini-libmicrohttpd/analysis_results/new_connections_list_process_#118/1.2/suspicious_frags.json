  "explanation": "I did not mark the rest of the code as suspicious because it only uses standard C constructs: function definition, pointer declarations, assignments, boolean literal assignment (false), standard control flow (do/while, if), standard (void) casts to suppress warnings, and C-style comments. No explicit compiler-extension tokens (such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, computed goto labels (&&label), or other compiler-specific keywords) appear directly in the shown code. The listed fragments are macro or function-like invocations whose definitions are not present in the snippet; those definitions may employ compiler-specific extensions, so they should be investigated. The remainder of the code contains no indications of language extensions that require inspection."
