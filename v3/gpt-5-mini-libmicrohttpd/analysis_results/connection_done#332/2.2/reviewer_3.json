  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The (void) toe; expression is an explicit no-op used to document/suppress an unused-parameter diagnostic. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code only when its removal would not affect program behaviour. Note 1 to the rule explicitly points out that behaviour of embedded systems can depend on timing, so even a seemingly inert operation may affect behaviour (timing, side effects on observables) and therefore cannot be categorically treated as dead code. Moreover, using a (void) cast to mark an intentionally unused parameter is an established, intentional idiom to keep the parameter in the signature (for API consistency or future use) and to avoid compiler warnings. For these reasons the single cast-to-void statement should not be considered a violation of Rule 2.2."
