  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The explicit (void)connection; (and the similar casts for cls and toe) are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings; they serve a purpose (documentation and control of diagnostics). MISRA Rule 2.2 targets truly useless operations that remain in the program with no intent or effect on behaviour of the embedded system. Although removing the cast-to-void would not change program runtime behaviour, it would change compilation diagnostics and removes the explicit intent that the parameter is unused. Therefore these statements are not considered dead code in the sense intended by MISRA and do not violate Rule 2.2."
