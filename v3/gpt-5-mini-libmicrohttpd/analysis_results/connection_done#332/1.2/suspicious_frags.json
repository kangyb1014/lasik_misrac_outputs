  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment only uses standard C constructs (static function, pointer and struct access, enum type, casts to void to silence unused parameters, calls to standard C library functions like free and abort). The use of close() is a POSIX library call, not a compiler language extension. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __declspec, inline assembly, compiler pragmas that enable extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
