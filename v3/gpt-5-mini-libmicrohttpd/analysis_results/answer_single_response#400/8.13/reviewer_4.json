According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. In this case it should be 'const void *cls' (or similar) because the function does not alter the pointed-to object.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 (\u201cA pointer should point to a const\u2011qualified type whenever possible\u201d) is a guidance to prefer const where it does not conflict with required interfaces, but this function is a callback whose prototype must match the external library\u2019s signature (libmicrohttpd\u2019s request handler uses void *cls). You cannot change the parameter type to const void *cls without breaking the required callback type. The code marks cls as unused ((void) cls;) which is the correct approach in this situation. Therefore there is no actionable MISRA 8.13 violation here."
