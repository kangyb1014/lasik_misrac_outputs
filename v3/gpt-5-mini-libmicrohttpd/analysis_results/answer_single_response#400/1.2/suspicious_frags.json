  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No asm statements or inline assembly are present.\n- No compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))) or pragmas are used.\n- No GCC/Clang extensions such as statement expressions ({ ... }) or typeof(), no __extension__ tokens, no nested functions, and no use of non-standard keywords like __builtin_*.\n- No integer-to-pointer or pointer-to-integer casts are performed; the only cast is (void *) &marker which is a standard pointer-to-void conversion.\n- All constructs used (function-scope static, enum, pointer comparisons, calls to strcmp and library functions, parameter casting to void to suppress warnings) are standard C and not documented as compiler extensions.\n- The MHD_* identifiers are library symbols/macros, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
