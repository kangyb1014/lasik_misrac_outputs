  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_short_params_str:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_short_params_str (const char *params_str, const char *next_param)\n{\n  if (0 == params_str[0])\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Unrecognised parameter: -\\n\");\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  do\n  {\n    enum PerfRepl_param_result param_res;\n    param_res = process_short_param (params_str, next_param);\n    if (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR != param_res)\n      return param_res;\n  } while (0 != (++params_str)[0]);\n  return PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  do\n  {\n    enum PerfRepl_param_result param_res;\n    param_res = process_short_param (params_str, next_param);\n    if (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR != param_res)\n      return param_res;\n  } while (0 != (++params_str)[0]);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated: MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well\u2011formedness of for statements; the fragment shown is a do...while loop, so Rule 14.2 does not apply. (A relevant point to note: the loop condition contains a side effect (++params_str). If this were placed in a for statement\u2019s second clause that would violate clause 2 \u2014 the condition must have no persistent side effects. If ++params_str were the for\u2011loop increment it would be acceptable only if params_str is the single loop counter and is not modified in the loop body or by called functions.)"
