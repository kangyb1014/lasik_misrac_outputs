  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No GCC/Clang/MSVC extension keywords are used (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __typeof__, __builtin_*, __extension__).\n- There are no nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, or inline assembly blocks.\n- The declaration of a local variable (enum PerfRepl_param_result param_res;) inside the do block is standard since C99/C11 (not a compiler extension). If a target compiler lacks C99 support that would be a language-standard conformance issue, not a compiler-specific extension usage violation per Rule 1.2 as specified.\n- The expression (++params_str)[0] and array indexing of params_str are valid standard C expressions and are not compiler extensions.\n- Use of standard library call fprintf and enum return types are standard C.\n\nHence there are no fragments that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
