  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_short_params_str:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_short_params_str (const char *params_str, const char *next_param)\n{\n  if (0 == params_str[0])\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Unrecognised parameter: -\\n\");\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  do\n  {\n    enum PerfRepl_param_result param_res;\n    param_res = process_short_param (params_str, next_param);\n    if (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR != param_res)\n      return param_res;\n  } while (0 != (++params_str)[0]);\n  return PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR != param_res) return param_res;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "When process_short_param returns a value other than PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR (for example PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR for an invalid option), the 'return param_res;' immediately exits process_short_params_str and propagates that result. Removing this statement would change program behaviour (errors would be ignored and processing would continue), so the statement is reachable and necessary."
