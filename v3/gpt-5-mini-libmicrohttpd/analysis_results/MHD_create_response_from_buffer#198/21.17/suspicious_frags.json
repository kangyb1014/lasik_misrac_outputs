  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this snippet with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The rule concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that can access beyond pointed object bounds. The shown function contains only conditional logic and calls to other helper functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls and MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy) and does not itself invoke any of the standard string handling functions. There are no calls to memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc., nor any direct buffer manipulation in this fragment. Note: the buffer and size are forwarded to other functions; if those implementations use string.h functions, they must be inspected separately. However, within the presented code there is no evidence of string.h usage or out-of-bounds access, so no fragments here need investigation for Rule 21.17."
