Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining parts of the function (the function signature, macro _MHD_EXTERN, the return type, parameter declarations, and the enclosing braces) are standard declarative/control-flow elements and do not by themselves represent executed operations that could be removed without affecting program behaviour. The conditional checks and the three return calls are the only executed operations in this function \u2014 they determine the runtime behaviour by dispatching to different helper functions, so they must be investigated. There are no other statements (assignments, computations, or unreachable labels) in the function body that would be candidates for dead code beyond the three returned call-sites listed above."
