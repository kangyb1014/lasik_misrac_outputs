Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer (size_t size,\n                                 void *buffer,\n                                 enum MHD_ResponseMemoryMode mode)\n{\n  if (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE == mode)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                   buffer,\n                                                                   &free,\n                                                                   buffer);\n  if (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY == mode)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy (size,\n                                                 buffer);\n\n  return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 NULL,\n                                                                 NULL);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE == mode)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                   buffer,\n                                                                   &free,\n                                                                   buffer);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The 'if' branch is executed when mode == MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE and returns a response created with free as the free-callback. Removing this branch (or the call) would change program behaviour for that input value of mode, so it is not dead code. (Only if the callee ignored the callback entirely could the call be semantically dead, but that would be an implementation detail of the callee, not evident here.)"
