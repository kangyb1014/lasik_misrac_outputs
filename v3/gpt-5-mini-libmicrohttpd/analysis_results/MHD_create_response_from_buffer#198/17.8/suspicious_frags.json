  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in the provided code. The function takes parameters (size, buffer, mode) and only uses them in comparisons and calls to other functions; there are no statements that assign to size, buffer, or mode. Passing buffer as an argument to other functions (or passing &free) does not modify the parameter variable itself \u2014 MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but forbids modifying the pointer variable, and this code does not perform such modification. Therefore no code fragments require investigation under Rule 17.8."
