  "explanation": "Fragments reported above are places where code may be effectively unreachable depending on build-time macros or on integer wrap/field values and thus merit investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1. Other parts of the function (the assertion, the computation of bytes_have, the while loop that processes full blocks, the sha512_256_transform calls, and normal pointer arithmetic/memcpy usage) are standard control-flow constructs that are conditionally executed based on the runtime value of 'length' or 'ctx->count' and are not intrinsically unreachable. In particular: the main while-loop and the memcpy calls inside it are reachable whenever length >= SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE; the mhd_assert is a runtime check (or a no-op in non-debug builds) rather than unreachable code; simple assignments and the function prologue are always reachable. Therefore they do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
