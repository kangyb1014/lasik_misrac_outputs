The rule requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible; here response_page should be declared const char *response_page (or equivalent) since it is used as a read-only string (strlen and response creation do not modify it).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in the conditional sense they state. MISRA C:2023 R8.13 requires that pointers should be to const-qualified types when they are not used to modify the pointed-to object. In the fragment shown, param->response_page is only used for read-only operations (strlen and creating a response), so if struct handler_param actually declares response_page as char *response_page (non-const) that declaration would violate R8.13 \u2014 it should be declared const char *response_page (unless the object is intended to be modified elsewhere). Note that the pasted function alone does not prove a violation because the struct definition is not shown; the violation depends on how response_page is declared and used elsewhere."
