  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses only standard C constructs: a function with standard prototype, an enum return type, a local static variable (permitted by the standard), ordinary pointer casts from void* to a struct pointer, (void) casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings, calls to library functions/macros (MHD_* APIs) and standard library functions (strlen), and standard block comments. There are no GCC/clang/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, address-of-label (&&label), nonstandard keywords, or other compiler-specific extensions that would be flagged by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Therefore no fragments require further investigation under Rule 1.2."
