It performs no side effects (upload_data_size is not volatile or otherwise side-effecting here), so it is dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The four (void) param; statements are the conventional and intentional way to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. They are not performing any runtime action that affects the behaviour of the embedded system, but neither are they accidental dead code: they are explicit annotations of intent and affect compilation diagnostics (and thus maintainability). In practice MISRA guidance recognises this idiom as the accepted way to indicate unused parameters rather than an actual defect. Therefore this source does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation in context."
