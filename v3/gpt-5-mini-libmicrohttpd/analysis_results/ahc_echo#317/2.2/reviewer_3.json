  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The single-statement casts \u201c(void) url;\u201d, \u201c(void) version;\u201d, etc. are the conventional way to document intentionally unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings. Although these statements have no effect on runtime behaviour, MISRA\u2019s intent for Rule 2.2 is to forbid executable code that is superfluous to the program\u2019s runtime behaviour; in practice, explicit void-casts for unused parameters are an accepted, deliberate idiom to record intent and to avoid spurious diagnostics. Removing them only affects compiler diagnostics and source clarity, not the embedded system\u2019s runtime behaviour, and such use is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation in typical MISRA interpretations. Therefore agent A\u2019s assertion that those lines violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
