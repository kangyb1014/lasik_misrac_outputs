  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) version;' is an expression statement that evaluates a non-volatile pointer and has no observable effect on program state; removing it would not change program behaviour (other than minute timing differences that are normally not considered a behavioural effect). Under the textual definition of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), this cast-to-void is executed but a no-op and therefore qualifies as dead code. The same applies to the other '(void) ...' lines in the function. (If the parameter were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, or if timing differences are specifically considered behaviour in the application, the conclusion could differ; as written it is a true no-op.)"
