  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__connections:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__connections (void)\n{\n  if (0 == tool_params.connections)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (get_num_threads () > tool_params.connections)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"The connections number limit (%u) is less than number \"\n             \"of threads used (%u).

  "scenario": "The final 'return ! 0;' is reachable when tool_params.connections != 0 and get_num_threads() <= tool_params.connections; it returns a non\u2011zero value (1). Removing it would change the function's behaviour (either change the return value or cause undefined behaviour by falling off a non\u2011void function), so it is not dead code."
