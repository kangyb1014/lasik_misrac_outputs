  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the conditional returns and the final return that determine control flow; these are the locations where unreachable code could arise (for example if the conditions can be resolved at compile time or by constants, making some branches impossible). Other pieces of the function (the string literal concatenation in fprintf, the fprintf call arguments syntax, whitespace and braces, and the function signature) are normal constructs that do not by themselves introduce unreachable code and therefore do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1 in this function. No statements occur syntactically after an unconditional return within the same block (other than the separate conditional branches already reported), so there are no additional obvious unreachable-code suspects in this snippet."
