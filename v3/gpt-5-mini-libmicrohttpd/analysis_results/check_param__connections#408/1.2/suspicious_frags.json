  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition with (void) parameter list, ordinary if statements, integer comparisons, logical negation (! 0) to produce 1, calls to get_num_threads() and fprintf(), and adjacent string literal concatenation \u2014 all standard C. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __builtin_..., statement-expressions ({:}), nested functions, inline assembly, extension keywords, or other constructs that compilers document as extensions. (Note: the identifier contains a double underscore in the name check_param__connections; while identifiers with double underscores are reserved by the C standard and may be undesirable, that is not a compiler language-extension feature per se and thus does not trigger Rule 1.2 under the requirement to report explicit compiler extensions.) Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
