  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression '0 == tool_params.connections' depends on the variable member tool_params.connections and is not an invariant. This would only violate Rule 14.3 if tool_params.connections were an invariant (for example a compile-time constant or macro), in which case the condition would be always true/false."
