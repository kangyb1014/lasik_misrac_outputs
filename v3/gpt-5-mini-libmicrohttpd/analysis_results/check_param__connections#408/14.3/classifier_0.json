  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression 'get_num_threads() > tool_params.connections' is not invariant \u2014 it depends on the return value of get_num_threads() and on tool_params.connections. Rule 14.3 would be violated only if the expression were invariant (for example if get_num_threads() always returned a constant and tool_params.connections were a constant so the comparison value never changed)."
