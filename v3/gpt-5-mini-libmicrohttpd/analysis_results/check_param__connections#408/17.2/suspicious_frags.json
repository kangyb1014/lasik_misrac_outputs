    "fprintf (stderr, \"The connections number limit (%u) is less than number \"\n             \"of threads used (%u). Use higher value for connections limit.\\n\",\n             tool_params.connections, get_num_threads ());",

  "explanation": "Only function calls inside this function body can create direct or indirect recursion. The two fragments above are the only function-call sites: get_num_threads() (used in the if condition and again as an argument to fprintf) and the call to fprintf itself. All other code in the function are simple variable accesses (tool_params.connections), comparisons, and return expressions (return !0; return 0;) that do not invoke other functions and therefore cannot introduce recursion. Thus no other fragments require investigation for Rule 17.2."
