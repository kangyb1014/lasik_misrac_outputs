  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. check_param__connections calls get_num_threads() and fprintf(), neither of which is the same function. This does not constitute direct recursion. An MISRA 17.2 violation would occur only if one of the called functions (e.g. get_num_threads or any function it calls) eventually called check_param__connections (directly or via a chain), creating indirect recursion."
