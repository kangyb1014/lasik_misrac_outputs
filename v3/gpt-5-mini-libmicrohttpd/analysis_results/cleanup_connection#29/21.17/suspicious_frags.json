  "explanation": "No direct uses of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function body. The remaining statements not listed above are simple control-flow, boolean checks, assignments, and asserts (e.g. in_cleanup test, setting flags, comparisons of timeout values) that do not invoke the standard string functions and therefore do not fall under Rule 21.17. The selected fragments are function or macro calls from which string.h usages could originate (directly inside those functions/macros or in code they call) and thus should be investigated further. All other lines are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need to be investigated for out-of-bounds accesses via the <string.h> API."
