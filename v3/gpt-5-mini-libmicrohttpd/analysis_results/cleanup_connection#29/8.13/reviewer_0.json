If the prototype of MHD_itc_activate_ declares the parameter as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *), this discards the const nature of the literal and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when modification is not required.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's reasoning is correct in principle but cannot be confirmed from the cleanup_connection snippet alone. The only expression of concern in the code is the string literal \"c\" passed to MHD_itc_activate_. Whether that is a MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 violation depends on the prototype of MHD_itc_activate_. If the function is declared to take a non-const pointer (for example, char *), then passing a string literal (which should be treated as immutable here) exposes a mismatch and indicates the function parameter should be const-qualified \u2014 i.e. it would be a Rule 8.13 issue. If, however, the prototype already declares the parameter as const char * (or another appropriate const-qualified pointer type), then there is no violation.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the declaration of MHD_itc_activate_. If it is char *(or char *) for that parameter and the function does not modify the pointed-to data, change the parameter to const char * (or the appropriate const-qualified type). Do not silence the issue with a cast to (char *) as that would mask the const-discard and would not satisfy MISRA intent."
