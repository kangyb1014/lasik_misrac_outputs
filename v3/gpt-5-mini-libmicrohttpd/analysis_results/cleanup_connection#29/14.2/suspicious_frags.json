  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No explicit for statements appear in this function body, so there are no for-loops directly visible to check for Rule 14.2. The fragments listed above are macro invocations or function-like calls (including assertions and DLL/XDLL manipulations, mutex check macros, inter-thread communication calls, and logging macros) that are potential locations where for-statements could be hidden inside macro or function definitions; those definitions should be inspected for compliance with Rule 14.2. Other code in this function (simple assignments, if/else constructs, return, boolean flags, and direct member accesses) contains no for statements and does not itself create the for-loop well-formedness issues targeted by Rule 14.2, so they do not need further inspection with respect to that rule."
