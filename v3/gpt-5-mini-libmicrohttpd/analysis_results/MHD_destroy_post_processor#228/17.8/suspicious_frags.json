  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter itself (the pointer variable pp), not the object it points to. In this function there are no assignments to pp (no pp = ..., no increments/decrements of pp, nor taking its address to store elsewhere). All operations are dereferences and mutations of the pointee (pp->state, pp->have, pp->xbuf_pos, freeing nested_boundary, calling functions that receive pp) or deallocation of the pointee (free_unmarked(pp); free(pp)). Passing pp to other functions also passes the pointer by value and cannot modify the caller's parameter. Therefore none of the fragments in this function modify the parameter variable pp itself, so no code fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
