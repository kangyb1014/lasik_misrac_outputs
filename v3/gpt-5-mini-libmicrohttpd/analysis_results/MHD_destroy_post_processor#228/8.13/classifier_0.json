  "scenario": "Not violated in this fragment. The pointer is being freed, so it must refer to owned, modifiable heap memory; declaring it const would be inappropriate (and would require casting when calling free). A real Rule 8.13 violation would occur if the member were declared without const while it is only ever read and should be const \u2014 e.g. if pp->nested_boundary is declared as 'char *nested_boundary' but never modified anywhere and only used for reading, it should be 'const char *nested_boundary'. Conversely, making a pointer const and then passing it to free (e.g. free((void *)some_const_ptr)) would also be problematic."
