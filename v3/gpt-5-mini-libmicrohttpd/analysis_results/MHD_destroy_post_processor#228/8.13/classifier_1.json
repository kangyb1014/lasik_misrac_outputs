  "scenario": "The call passes a string literal (\"\\n\") which decays to a pointer to char. If the prototype of post_process_urlencoded declares the corresponding parameter as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *), this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. If the function parameter is declared as const char * (or otherwise does not allow modification), then there is no violation."
