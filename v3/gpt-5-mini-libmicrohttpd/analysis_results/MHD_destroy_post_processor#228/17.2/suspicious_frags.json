  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they do not perform function calls that could lead to direct or indirect recursion. The NULL check and early return, the state check, the comments, the assignment/selection of ret, the assignment pp->have = NE_none, and the conditional frees of pp->nested_boundary and pp itself are simple control, data-manipulation or standard-library memory-deallocation operations. The only places that invoke other user-defined routines are the two calls listed above; those are the only sites where an indirect call back to MHD_destroy_post_processor could occur and therefore are the only fragments that need further investigation."
