  "explanation": "I flagged the function declaration that uses the macro _MHD_EXTERN because such macros are commonly used to inject compiler-specific storage-class/visibility attributes (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)), which are compiler extensions \u2014 the macro definition is not present in this fragment and therefore warrants investigation. No other code in the supplied function body contains obvious compiler-specific language extensions: there are no uses of __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, C++-style attributes, or other nonstandard keywords or constructs. All other constructs (enum return type, pointer parameters, if statements, string literal, function calls, free()) are standard C and do not, in themselves, indicate use of a compiler language extension."
