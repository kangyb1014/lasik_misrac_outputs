  "explanation": "The function parameter list shows that the pointer parameter 'str' is declared as 'const char *str' (pointer to const char) \u2014 the pointer itself is not declared const, so modifications to the pointer value should be checked. The only code fragment that actually changes a parameter in the body is 'str++;', which modifies the parameter 'str' (increments the pointer). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8: - The assignment 'const char *const start = str;' copies the pointer into a local const pointer but does not modify the parameter. - The null checks 'if (! str || ! out_val)' only read parameter values. - Calls that dereference the pointer (toxdigitvalue(*str)) only read the pointed object; reading is allowed. - The write '*out_val = res;' modifies the object pointed to by out_val, which is explicitly allowed by the rule (the pointer itself is not modified). - All arithmetic and comparisons on local 'res' and 'digit' do not affect parameters. - The final expression '(str - start)' computes a difference without modifying either pointer. Therefore only the pointer increment(s) to 'str' require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
