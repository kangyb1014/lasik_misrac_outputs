  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (use of string.h functions causing out-of-bounds accesses) is not directly applicable to this code fragment. The function only reads characters via *str and advances the pointer; these are not uses of the Standard string handling functions covered by Rule 21.17. Note: the helper toxdigitvalue() is called here \u2014 if that function (or any functions it calls) uses <string.h> routines, those implementations would need to be inspected separately for Rule 21.17 compliance, but that is outside the scope of this function as provided."
