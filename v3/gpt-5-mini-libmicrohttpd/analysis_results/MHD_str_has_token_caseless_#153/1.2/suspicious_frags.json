  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition, pointer and const qualifiers, size_t, character literals, integer constants, while/if control flow, and calls to other functions (e.g. charsequalcaseless). The use of bool is a standard C99/_Bool feature (via stdbool.h) rather than a compiler extension. There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, register storage-class misuse, GCC statement-expressions, inline assembler, or other vendor-specific keywords. The identifier naming (trailing underscore) and idioms like while(1) are not language extensions. Because no extension-specific syntax is present in the shown code, there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
