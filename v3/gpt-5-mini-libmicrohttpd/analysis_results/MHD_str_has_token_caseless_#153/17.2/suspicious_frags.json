  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect self-calls. A scan of the function body shows no direct call to MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ and no other function calls except charsequalcaseless. All remaining code fragments are local operations (loops, pointer increments, comparisons, returns) that cannot produce recursion by themselves. Therefore only the call to charsequalcaseless needs investigation to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls MHD_str_has_token_caseless_. No other fragments in this function can introduce direct or indirect recursion and so do not require investigation for Rule 17.2."
