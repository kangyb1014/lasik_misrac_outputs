  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. A scan of this function finds no use of memcmp. All comparisons are done character-by-character (via the call to charsequalcaseless) and with explicit checks for the NUL terminator and token length, so there is no direct memcmp-based string comparison here. The token_len bound and the checks for (0 == *str) ensure no implicit comparison of null-terminated strings via memcmp. The only external call is charsequalcaseless, but that is a single-character comparison performed here; its implementation is not present in this fragment. If that external function (not shown) used memcmp on null-terminated strings, that implementation would need to be inspected separately, but there is no memcmp usage within the provided code to flag under Rule 21.14."
