  "explanation": "All other loop controlling expressions in the function are dependent on runtime data and thus are not invariant: - while (0 != *str) depends on the contents pointed to by str, which is advanced within the loop. - while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str) depends on *str and str is incremented in the loop body. - while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str) depends on *str and str is modified. - while (0 != *str && ',' != *str) depends on *str and str is modified. None of these are constant/invariant expressions. Therefore they do not trigger Rule 14.3 concerns. The only construct needing review is the explicitly infinite inner loop listed above."
