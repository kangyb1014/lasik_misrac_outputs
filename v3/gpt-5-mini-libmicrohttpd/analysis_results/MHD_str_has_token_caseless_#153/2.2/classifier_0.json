Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_has_token_caseless_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (const char *str,\n                             const char *const token,\n                             size_t token_len)\n{\n  if (0 == token_len)\n    return false;\n\n  while (0 != *str)\n  {\n    size_t i;\n    /* Skip all whitespaces and empty tokens. */\n    while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str)\n      str++;\n\n    /* Check for token match. */\n    i = 0;\n    while (1)\n    {\n      const char sc = *(str++);\n      const char tc = token[i++];\n\n      if (0 == sc)\n        return false;\n      if (! charsequalcaseless (sc, tc))\n        break;\n      if (i >= token_len)\n      {\n        /* Check whether substring match token fully or\n         * has additional unmatched chars at tail. */\n        while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str)\n          str++;\n        /* End of (sub)string? */\n        if ((0 == *str) || (',' == *str) )\n          return true;\n        /* Unmatched chars at end of substring. */\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    /* Find next substring. */\n    while (0 != *str && ',' != *str)\n      str++;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == token_len)\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if (0 == token_len) return false; is an active runtime check that alters behavior when token_len equals 0 \u2014 removing it would change the function\u2019s behavior for that input. It would only be dead code if it can be proven (by analysis of all call sites or by static guarantees) that token_len is never zero; in that specific provable case the check would be redundant, but as presented it is not dead code."
