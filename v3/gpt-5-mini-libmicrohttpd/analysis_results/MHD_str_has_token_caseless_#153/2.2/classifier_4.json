  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_has_token_caseless_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (const char *str,\n                             const char *const token,\n                             size_t token_len)\n{\n  if (0 == token_len)\n    return false;\n\n  while (0 != *str)\n  {\n    size_t i;\n    /* Skip all whitespaces and empty tokens. */\n    while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str)\n      str++;\n\n    /* Check for token match. */\n    i = 0;\n    while (1)\n    {\n      const char sc = *(str++);\n      const char tc = token[i++];\n\n      if (0 == sc)\n        return false;\n      if (! charsequalcaseless (sc, tc))\n        break;\n      if (i >= token_len)\n      {\n        /* Check whether substring match token fully or\n         * has additional unmatched chars at tail. */\n        while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str)\n          str++;\n        /* End of (sub)string? */\n        if ((0 == *str) || (',' == *str) )\n          return true;\n        /* Unmatched chars at end of substring. */\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    /* Find next substring. */\n    while (0 != *str && ',' != *str)\n      str++;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (1)\n    {\n      const char sc = *(str++);\n      const char tc = token[i++];\n\n      if (0 == sc)\n        return false;\n      if (! charsequalcaseless (sc, tc))\n        break;\n      if (i >= token_len)\n      {\n        /* Check whether substring match token fully or\n         * has additional unmatched chars at tail. */\n        while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str)\n          str++;\n        /* End of (sub)string? */\n        if ((0 == *str) || (',' == *str) )\n          return true;\n        /* Unmatched chars at end of substring. */\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The assignment const char tc = token[i++]; (and the increment of i) is executed even when sc == 0 and the function immediately returns. In that branch the read of token[i] and the increment of i have no observable effect on program behaviour (the function returns), so those operations are executed but could be removed without changing behaviour. Therefore the code contains dead code (violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2)."
