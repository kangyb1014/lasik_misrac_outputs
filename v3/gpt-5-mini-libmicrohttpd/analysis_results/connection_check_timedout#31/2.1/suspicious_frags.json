  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists of simple runtime-dependent checks and early returns (e.g. checks of c->suspended, timeout == 0, computing now and since_actv, the final return true/false). Those statements are not statically unreachable because their execution depends on runtime values (connection state, timeout, and monotonic counter). Conditional logging blocks are controlled by compile-time macros (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) and do not represent unreachable code in the general build configurations where the macro may be defined. The arithmetic expressions (now - c->last_activity and c->last_activity - now) are intentional unsigned operations to detect wrap/backwards jumps and can produce different results at runtime; therefore they are not intrinsically unreachable. Only the two fragments listed above (the wrap-detection block and the inner small-jump branch) are potentially unreachable under normal monotonic behavior and should be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.1 compliance."
