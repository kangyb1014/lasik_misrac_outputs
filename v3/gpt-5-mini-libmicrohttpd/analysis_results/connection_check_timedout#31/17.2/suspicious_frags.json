  "explanation": "I selected all code fragments that invoke other functions or macros that could potentially lead (directly or indirectly) back to connection_check_timedout, and one comment that explicitly references another function (connection_get_wait) implying a relationship that should be checked for indirect recursion. Other parts of the function do not require investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain only: simple member accesses (e.g. c->suspended, c->connection_timeout_ms, c->last_activity, c->daemon), constant checks (e.g. 0 == timeout, UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv), pure arithmetic/subtraction, comparisons, return statements, variable declarations, and comments. None of those are function calls and therefore cannot produce direct or indirect recursion by themselves. The PRIu64 token is a printf format macro, not a function call, so it is not a recursion risk. No direct call to connection_check_timedout appears in the code, so the remaining investigation should focus on the listed fragments (the monotonic clock call, logging calls, and the noted relationship to connection_get_wait) to determine whether any of them (or functions they call) could, directly or indirectly, call connection_check_timedout."
