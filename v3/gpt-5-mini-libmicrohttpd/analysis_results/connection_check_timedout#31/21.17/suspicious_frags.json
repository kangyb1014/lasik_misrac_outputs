  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) or any other string-handling API that takes pointer parameters in the provided function. All operations are integer arithmetic and conditional checks on uint64_t values, and logging calls (MHD_DLOG) use format strings rather than string.h routines. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
