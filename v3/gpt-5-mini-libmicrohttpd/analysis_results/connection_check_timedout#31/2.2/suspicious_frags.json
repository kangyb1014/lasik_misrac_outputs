  "explanation": "All other statements in the function perform essential runtime checks or return values that clearly affect behaviour and therefore are not candidate dead code: - The early returns (c->suspended and timeout == 0) prevent further processing and their removal would change behaviour. - now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter() and since_actv = now - c->last_activity are used in the timeout comparison and are necessary. - The outer timeout comparison (if (timeout < since_actv) ... return true) is the primary functional branch deciding timeout and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. - The final return false is the default result and necessary. - The logging lines wrapped in #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES are conditionally compiled; when the macro is enabled they are active and affect diagnostics, and when disabled they are not present in the built code (not dead code in the sources). The only fragment that requires investigation for potential dead-code (per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2) is the block that handles very large since_actv values (wrap/clock-jump detection): on many targets a 64-bit monotonic counter may never wrap or the condition may never be true in practice, which could make that block effectively dead. The reported fragment contains the wrap-detection condition, the jump_back computation, the small-jump branch that returns false, and the diagnostic logging \u2014 all of which should be reviewed to determine if they are actually reachable and if their removal would or would not affect program behaviour."
