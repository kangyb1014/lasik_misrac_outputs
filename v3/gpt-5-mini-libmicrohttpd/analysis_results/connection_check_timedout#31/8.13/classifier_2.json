  "scenario": "The code passes a string literal (the result of the _() translation macro) to MHD_DLOG. If either the _() macro/gettext returns a plain char * or MHD_DLOG's corresponding parameter is declared as char * (non-const), then a pointer to a non-const-qualified type is being used when a const-qualified pointer is appropriate (string literals and translation literals should be treated as const char *). In that situation Rule 8.13 is violated. If, however, MHD_DLOG's prototype accepts a const char * (and _() yields const char *), there is no violation."
