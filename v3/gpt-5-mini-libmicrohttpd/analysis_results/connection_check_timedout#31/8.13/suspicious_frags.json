  "explanation": "The only pointer visible in this function is the parameter c (struct MHD_Connection *c) and the member c->daemon passed to the logging macro. These should be investigated to determine whether they could/should be declared to point to const-qualified types. All other identifiers in the function are non-pointer scalar types (uint64_t, const uint64_t), or control-flow constructs; they are already const-qualified where appropriate or are not pointer declarations, so they do not fall under Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated. No other pointer declarations or uses appear in the provided code fragment."
