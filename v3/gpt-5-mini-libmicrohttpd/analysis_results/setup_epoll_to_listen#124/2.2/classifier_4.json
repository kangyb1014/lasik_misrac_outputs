  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of setup_epoll_to_listen:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nsetup_epoll_to_listen (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  struct epoll_event event;\n  MHD_socket ls;\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_ (daemon));\n  mhd_assert (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION));\n  mhd_assert ( (!

In typical configurations the macro is either compiled out (no code generated) or it performs checking/logging/abort on failure \u2014 in the latter case its removal would change program behaviour when the check fails. Therefore this statement is not dead code. (Only a hypothetical violation would occur if mhd_assert expands to a no\u2011op that still evaluates a side\u2011effect\u2011free condition that is guaranteed true at runtime \u2014 in that contrived case the executed operation would be removable without changing behaviour and would therefore be dead code.)"
