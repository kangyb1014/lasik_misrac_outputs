  "explanation": "I selected all places where pointers to data related to 'daemon' or other potentially const-qualified objects are passed or assigned in a way that could remove or fail to use const qualification: the two explicit assignments to the epoll event payload (one of which uses _MHD_DROP_CONST to remove const), the call returning/setting daemon->epoll_fd, and calls/macros that take 'daemon' as a pointer parameter (these may be read-only and could accept a const-qualified pointer). These are the locations most likely to violate Rule 8.13 by allowing or removing mutation where a const-qualified pointer would be preferable. Other fragments in the function were not selected because they do not involve pointer-to-object usage that could reasonably be made const: e.g. passing &event to epoll_ctl is required by the API and expects a mutable struct epoll_event pointer, socket descriptors and integer assignments are not pointers, and calls such as MHD_itc_r_fd_ or MHD_socket_last_strerr_ either return non-pointer scalar types or produce/consume data where const qualification is not applicable. Review should focus on the listed fragments to determine whether the pointers could and should point to const-qualified types or whether the const qualifier is being unsafely dropped."
