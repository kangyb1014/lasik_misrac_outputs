  "explanation": "The function check_apply_param__threads has no formal parameters (signature: void). Therefore there are no function parameters that could be modified, and Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function. The only assignments/uses are: reading tool_params.threads, assigning its value to num_threads (a local or global object, not a function parameter), and calling other functions (get_process_cpu_core_count, get_cpu_core_count, fprintf, printf, print_all_cores_used). Passing stderr or other values to called functions does not constitute modification of this function's parameters. No pointer parameters are declared or assigned to in this function, so the pointer-specific aspect of the rule (pointer parameter itself shall not be modified) is also not applicable. Consequently, there are no fragments requiring investigation for Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
