  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The controlling expression if (get_cpu_core_count() == num_threads) is not invariant in the given context: it depends on a function call and a variable (num_threads) determined at run time, so the condition can vary. (It would be a violation only if both sides were compile\u2011time/invariant values \u2014 e.g. get_cpu_core_count() was a constant/macro and num_threads were an unchanging constant such that the equality is always true or always false.)"
