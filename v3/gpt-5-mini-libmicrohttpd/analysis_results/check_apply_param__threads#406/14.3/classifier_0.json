  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression depends on the run\u2011time variable tool_params.threads, so it is not invariant. A violation would occur if tool_params.threads were a compile\u2011time constant (for example #define THREADS 0 or static const unsigned int threads = 0), making the test always true (invariant) \u2014 in that case the condition would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
