  "explanation": "Only the three if statements contain controlling expressions and therefore are the only constructs potentially subject to Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other conditional statements in this function besides the listed ifs. Other code fragments are not controlling expressions and so do not apply to this rule: the assignment (num_threads = tool_params.threads;) is not a control expression; the fprintf/printf and print_all_cores_used() calls are ordinary function calls/statements and not loop/branch controls; the return statement is a simple flow control but its preceding if is already listed. No do-while infinite-loop exceptions are present. Therefore only the three if statements need investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
