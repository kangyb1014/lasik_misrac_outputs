  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_param__threads:\n```c\nstatic void\ncheck_apply_param__threads (void)\n{\n  if (0 == tool_params.threads)\n    return;\n\n  num_threads = tool_params.threads;\n\n  if (get_process_cpu_core_count () < num_threads)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The requested number of threads (%u) is \"\n             \"higher than the number of detected available CPU cores (%u).\\n\",\n             num_threads, get_process_cpu_core_count ());\n    fprintf (stderr, \"This decreases the performance. \"\n             \"Consider using fewer threads.\\n\");\n  }\n  if (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads)\n  {\n    printf (\"The requested number of threads is equal to the number of \"\n            \"detected CPU cores.\\n\");\n    print_all_cores_used ();\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == tool_params.threads)\n    return;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The 'if (0 == tool_params.threads) return;' is an executed conditional that changes function behavior (it causes an early exit when threads == 0). Removing it would change program behavior (num_threads would be set to 0 and later messages/logic would run), so this is not dead code."
