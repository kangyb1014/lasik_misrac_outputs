  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment calls get_process_cpu_core_count(), which by itself does not constitute recursion. There is no evidence in the provided code that get_process_cpu_core_count either directly calls check_apply_param__threads or indirectly does so via another chain of calls. Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated. (If get_process_cpu_core_count were implemented to call check_apply_param__threads \u2014 directly or through other functions \u2014 that would create an indirect recursion and would violate Rule 17.2.)"
