  "explanation": "Only function calls can produce direct or indirect recursion that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The fragments selected are all call sites in this function (two condition checks that invoke other functions, three I/O calls, and the call to print_all_cores_used). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the early return (if (0 == tool_params.threads) return;), the assignment (num_threads = tool_params.threads;), the numeric comparisons, and the string literals cannot create recursion by themselves and therefore are not relevant to Rule 17.2."
