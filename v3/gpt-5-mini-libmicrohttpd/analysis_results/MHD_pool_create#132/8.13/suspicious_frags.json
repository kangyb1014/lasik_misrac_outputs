  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. The listed fragments contain the function return pointer, the local pointer declaration and all assignments/usages of the pool->memory pointer (allocations, platform mappings, comparisons, casts and macro usage) and the function return \u2014 these are the code locations that need investigation for possible const-qualification. Other parts of the function (alloc_size arithmetic, size/pos/end/is_mmap assignments, control flow, mhd_assert checks on non-pointer values, ROUND_TO_ALIGN usage, free/NULL checks and preprocessor conditionals) do not introduce pointer-to-object declarations or pointer-to-data usages relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need to be investigated for this rule."
