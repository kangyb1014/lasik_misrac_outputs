First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function body, so MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 (requirements for well-formed for loops) cannot be violated by this snippet. The code uses conditionals, function calls and macros, but none of these expand to or include an explicit for loop in the shown source. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.2. (Note: if any referenced macros or external functions such as _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, ROUND_TO_ALIGN or others expand to for loops, those macro/function definitions would need separate review \u2014 they are not part of the supplied code and thus are not included here.)"
