  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression 'INT_MAX <= res' is not invariant. 'res' is an int64_t variable assigned at runtime (res = get_timeout_millisec_(...)), so the condition can evaluate differently at run time. The surrounding #if only affects compilation, it does not make the controlling expression invariant. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not violated."
