  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression 'INT_MAX <= res' depends on the runtime variable 'res' (assigned from get_timeout_millisec_), so it is not invariant. The #if only governs whether the check is compiled in; it does not make the if expression a compile-time invariant. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated."
