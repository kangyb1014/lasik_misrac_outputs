  "scenario": "No violation. The statement res = get_timeout_millisec_(daemon, max_timeout); is ordinary executable code and is reachable in normal control flow. A possible violation would only arise if get_timeout_millisec_ were defined/expanded such that it never returns (for example a macro that contains an infinite loop or a call to a function annotated as noreturn), which would make subsequent code unreachable \u2014 but there is no evidence of that here."
