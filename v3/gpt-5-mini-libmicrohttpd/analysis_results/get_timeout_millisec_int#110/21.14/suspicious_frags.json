  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided function performs only integer arithmetic and type conversion: it calls get_timeout_millisec_ (returning an int64_t), compares the numeric result to INT_MAX, and returns an int. There are no uses of memcmp, no includes or references to string.h, no char* or byte buffer variables, and no operations that compare or manipulate null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code locations in this fragment that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Any use of memcmp would have to be located in other code not shown here.)"
