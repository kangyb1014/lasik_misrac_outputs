  "explanation": "The only potential recursion concern in this fragment is the function call expression inside the body (the call could be a direct or indirect call back to this function via aliases/macros). Other parts of the function do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect self-calls: the local declaration (int64_t res;), the preprocessor conditional and integer-limit comparison, the cast and the final return are simple data operations and conditional compilation directives rather than call sites. Consequently those other lines need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
