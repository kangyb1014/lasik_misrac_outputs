  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_timeout_millisec_int:\n```c\nstatic int\nget_timeout_millisec_int (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                          int32_t max_timeout)\n{\n  int64_t res;\n\n  res = get_timeout_millisec_ (daemon, max_timeout);\n#if SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  if (INT_MAX <= res)\n    return INT_MAX;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n  return (int) res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  if (INT_MAX <= res)\n    return INT_MAX;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "On a platform where SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T (e.g. int is 32-bit, int64_t is 64-bit) and get_timeout_millisec_ can return a value greater than INT_MAX (for example res == 2147483648), the conditional if (INT_MAX <= res) return INT_MAX; is executed and caps the returned value to INT_MAX. Removing this check would change program behaviour (casting the out-of-range int64_t to int would produce an implementation-defined result or overflow), so the operation is not dead code."
