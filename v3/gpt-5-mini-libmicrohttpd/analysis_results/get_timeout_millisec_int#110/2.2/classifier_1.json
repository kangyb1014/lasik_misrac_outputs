Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_timeout_millisec_int:\n```c\nstatic int\nget_timeout_millisec_int (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                          int32_t max_timeout)\n{\n  int64_t res;\n\n  res = get_timeout_millisec_ (daemon, max_timeout);\n#if SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  if (INT_MAX <= res)\n    return INT_MAX;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n  return (int) res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic int\nget_timeout_millisec_int (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                          int32_t max_timeout)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Cannot determine from the fragment alone. The function as shown is declared static; if it is not referenced anywhere in the same translation unit (no calls, no address taken), then it would be dead code and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, it is called or its address is taken in the translation unit, it is not dead code and does not violate the rule."
