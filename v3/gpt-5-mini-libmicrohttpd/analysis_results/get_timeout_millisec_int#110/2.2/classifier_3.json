  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_timeout_millisec_int:\n```c\nstatic int\nget_timeout_millisec_int (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                          int32_t max_timeout)\n{\n  int64_t res;\n\n  res = get_timeout_millisec_ (daemon, max_timeout);\n#if SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  if (INT_MAX <= res)\n    return INT_MAX;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n  return (int) res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn (int) res;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The final `return (int) res;` is executed when the conditional early return does not occur (or when the #if is not present on platforms where int is at least 64 bits). Removing it would either leave the function without a return (undefined behaviour) or change the function\u2019s observable return value for cases where `res < INT_MAX`, so the statement is not dead code."
