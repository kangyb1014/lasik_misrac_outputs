Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the snippet do not require investigation for possible dead code: the local declaration `int64_t res;` is referenced later in the function (so it is not unused); the comment and preprocessor end marker are non-executable or structural; the function braces and whitespace are structural only. No other executable statements appear in the provided snippet. Note that investigation should focus on the reported fragments to determine whether any of them are effectively dead (e.g. due to build-time macros or never-invoked static linkage), while the remaining lines are not candidates for dead code in this context."
