  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which specifically restricts use of the string handling functions) is not directly applicable. The only memory accesses to the object pointed to by data are guarded by the test (0 != data_size) before any data[0] or data[i] dereferences, so there are no obvious indexed accesses beyond the bounds implied by data_size. The use of the _MHD_ROTL32 macro does not involve <string.h> functions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
