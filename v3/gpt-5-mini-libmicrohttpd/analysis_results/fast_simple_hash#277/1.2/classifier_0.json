  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "There is no evidence in this fragment that a compiler language extension is being used. _MHD_ROTL32 looks like a macro or function-like identifier; the expression uses standard C operators (call/macro expansion, XOR). Rule 1.2 would only be violated if _MHD_ROTL32 is a compiler-specific intrinsic documented as an extension \u2014 that cannot be determined from this fragment alone. Unless the definition of _MHD_ROTL32 is an explicitly documented compiler extension, Rule 1.2 is not violated."
