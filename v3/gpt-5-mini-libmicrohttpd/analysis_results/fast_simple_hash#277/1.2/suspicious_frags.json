  "explanation": "I reviewed the whole function. Apart from the listed fragment, all constructs are standard ISO C and not compiler language extensions: the function uses standard storage-class specifier (static), standard fixed-width integer types (uint32_t, uint8_t) and size_t, a normal if/else, a standard for loop with a size_t counter, array indexing, bitwise XOR, and a plain return. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as inline assembly, __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __inline, __asm, _Pragma used as extensions), or other non-standard syntax in the rest of the code. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2."
