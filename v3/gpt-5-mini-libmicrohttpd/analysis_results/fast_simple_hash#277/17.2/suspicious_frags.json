  "suspicious_frags": [
    "for (i = 1; i < data_size; i++)\n      hash = _MHD_ROTL32 (hash, 7) ^ data[i];",
    "hash = _MHD_ROTL32 (hash, 7) ^ data[i];"
  ],
  "explanation": "No direct call to fast_simple_hash is present in the function, and there are no other function-call expressions in this code fragment except the invocation of _MHD_ROTL32 (already listed). Declarations (size_t i;), assignments (hash = data[0]; hash = 0;), array subscripts (data[0], data[i]), the loop control, the return statement, and the function signature do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion. There are no function pointers or other call sites in the provided code that would warrant further investigation. The only potential source of indirect recursion in this snippet is the call(s) to _MHD_ROTL32, so its definition should be reviewed to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call fast_simple_hash."
