  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the function, so Rule 21.17 (use of <string.h> functions causing out-of-bounds accesses) is not directly applicable.\n\nAll direct accesses to the pointed-to buffer (str[i] / str[0]) are protected by checks and by the loop control:\n- The initial condition uses short-circuited logical OR: !str || !maxlen || !out_val || !isasciidigit(str[0]) \u2014 so str is tested for NULL and maxlen for zero before evaluating isasciidigit(str[0]), preventing an out-of-bounds/NULL dereference at index 0.\n- The loop is a do/while. The first access (i == 0) is guarded by the initial check above. For subsequent iterations, the loop\u2019s post-condition is (i < maxlen) && isasciidigit(str[i]) so the next iteration will only execute if i is strictly less than maxlen (i.e. within the intended bounds) and the character at that index is a digit; thus when the loop body runs it is safe to index str[i]. The do/while sequencing ensures there is no unguarded read beyond maxlen.\n\nThe helper isasciidigit is not a <string.h> function and therefore outside the specific scope of Rule 21.17; likewise casts to (unsigned char) and arithmetic on digit values do not involve string.h APIs.\n\nGiven the absence of any string.h function calls and the guarded buffer accesses described above, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
