  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_to_uint64_n_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_to_uint64_n_ (const char *str,\n                      size_t maxlen,\n                      uint64_t *out_val)\n{\n  uint64_t res;\n  size_t i;\n\n  if (! str || ! maxlen || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0]))\n    return 0;\n\n  res = 0;\n  i = 0;\n  do\n  {\n    const int digit = (unsigned char) str[i] - '0';\n\n    if ( (res > (UINT64_MAX / 10)) ||\n         ( (res == (UINT64_MAX / 10)) &&\n           ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 10)) ) )\n      return 0;\n\n    res *= 10;\n    res += (unsigned int) digit;\n    i++;\n  } while ( (i < maxlen) &&\n            isasciidigit (str[i]) );\n\n  *out_val = res;\n  return i;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nres += (unsigned int) digit;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
