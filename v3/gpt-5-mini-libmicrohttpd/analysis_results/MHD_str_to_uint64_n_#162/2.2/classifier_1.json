  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_to_uint64_n_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_to_uint64_n_ (const char *str,\n                      size_t maxlen,\n                      uint64_t *out_val)\n{\n  uint64_t res;\n  size_t i;\n\n  if (! str || ! maxlen || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0]))\n    return 0;\n\n  res = 0;\n  i = 0;\n  do\n  {\n    const int digit = (unsigned char) str[i] - '0';\n\n    if ( (res > (UINT64_MAX / 10)) ||\n         ( (res == (UINT64_MAX / 10)) &&\n           ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 10)) ) )\n      return 0;\n\n    res *= 10;\n    res += (unsigned int) digit;\n    i++;\n  } while ( (i < maxlen) &&\n            isasciidigit (str[i]) );\n\n  *out_val = res;\n  return i;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (res > (UINT64_MAX / 10)) ||\n         ( (res == (UINT64_MAX / 10)) &&\n           ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 10)) ) )\n      return 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-expression implements an essential overflow check: the first disjunct (res > UINT64_MAX/10) and the second disjunct (res == UINT64_MAX/10 && digit > UINT64_MAX%10) are both required to detect all overflow cases and can be taken for different runtime values of res and digit (digit ranges 0..9). Every sub-expression can affect whether the function returns 0 or continues, so no executed operation in this fragment can be removed without changing program behaviour. (The explicit cast (uint64_t) digit is redundant because integer promotion would yield the same comparison result, but that redundancy is not a semantic dead-code issue here and does not make the fragment violate Rule 2.2.)"
