  "explanation": "I inspected the function for any modification of its parameters. None of the three parameters (const char *str, size_t maxlen, uint64_t *out_val) are assigned to or otherwise modified as parameter variables inside the function. The only write that involves a parameter is the dereference *out_val = res; \u2014 this modifies the object pointed to by out_val, which is explicitly allowed by the rule. The pointer out_val itself is not reassigned. The const pointer str is only read (including via isasciidigit and indexing), and maxlen is only read in conditions and not modified. Temporary values and casts (e.g. (unsigned char) str[i] - '0') do not modify parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
