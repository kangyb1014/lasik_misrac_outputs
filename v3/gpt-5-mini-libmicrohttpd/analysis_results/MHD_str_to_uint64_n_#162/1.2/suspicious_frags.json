  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in this function. The code only uses standard C constructs: size_t and uint64_t (standard typedefs from <stddef.h>/<stdint.h>), the do/while loop, casts, integer-limits macro (UINT64_MAX from <stdint.h>), and a predicate/function-like macro isasciidigit (a library/helper predicate, not a compiler language extension). There are no occurrences of known compiler extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm/asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions, label-as-value, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
