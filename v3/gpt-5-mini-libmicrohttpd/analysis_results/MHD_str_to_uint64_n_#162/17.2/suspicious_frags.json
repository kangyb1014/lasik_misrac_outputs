  "explanation": "The rule targets direct or indirect calls to the same function. In this function the only function calls present are the two calls to isasciidigit; there are no calls to MHD_str_to_uint64_n_ itself, no other function calls, and no use of function pointers or callbacks that could introduce indirect recursion. Numeric macros (UINT64_MAX) and arithmetic/cast operations are not function calls. Therefore only the isasciidigit call sites require investigation for possible indirect recursion; the remaining code fragments (assignments, comparisons, returns, macros, and arithmetic) do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
