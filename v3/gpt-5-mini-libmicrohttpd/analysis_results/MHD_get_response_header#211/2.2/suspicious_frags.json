Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments should not be investigated for dead code: the function signature and storage-class macro (_MHD_EXTERN const char *) are required by the interface; the local declarations (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos; size_t key_size;) are used in the function flow; the NULL check for key (if (NULL == key) return NULL;) is an input validation that changes behavior if removed; the for-loop header (for (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)) controls iteration and is behaviorally relevant; the final return NULL; is the defined fallback result. These parts therefore cannot be removed without altering program behavior and are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2."
