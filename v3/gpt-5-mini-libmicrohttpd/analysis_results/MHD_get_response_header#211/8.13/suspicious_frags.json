  "explanation": "The remaining fragments in the function are simple null checks, size computations and comparisons that do not involve pointer qualifications and therefore do not raise Rule 8.13 concerns: the check for NULL key (if (NULL == key) return NULL;), computing key_size = strlen(key); the comparison (pos->header_size == key_size) and the final return NULL; these do not require additional const qualifications beyond what is already visible (the function return is const char * and the key parameter is const). The flagged fragments are those where pointer types could/should be const-qualified (the function parameter 'response', the local iterator 'pos', the use of pos->header in the string-compare call, and the returned pos->value), so they are reported for further investigation."
