  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not violate Rule 8.13. The function returns a const char * and returning pos->value either preserves constness (if pos->value is declared const char *) or adds const qualification to a char * (which is allowed). A violation would only exist if the declaration of the member pos->value in struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header is a non-const pointer (e.g. \"char *value;\") even though the pointed-to data is never modified and could/should be declared \"const char *value;\" \u2014 that would violate Rule 8.13, but that violation would be in the struct member declaration, not in the return statement shown."
