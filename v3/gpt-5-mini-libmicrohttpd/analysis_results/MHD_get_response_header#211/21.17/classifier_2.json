  "scenario": "The code calls strlen(key) after only checking for NULL; there is no guarantee that the object pointed to by key is NUL-terminated. If the caller passes a pointer to a non-terminated char buffer (e.g. a char array of length N without a terminating '\\0' or a pointer into a larger object whose accessible region ends before a '\\0'), strlen will scan past the bounds of the object and cause an out-of-bounds access."
