That makes the member access param->value.str have type 'char * const' if the struct member was declared as 'char *str' (the pointer itself becomes const, not the pointed-to data). The code calls memcmp() to read the bytes but the pointed-to type is not const-qualified (char *), so a pointer is pointing to a non-const object where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Recommended fix: declare the member as 'const char *str' (so param->value.str is 'const char * const') or otherwise ensure the pointed-to type is const if it is not meant to be modified.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is a guideline about pointer declarations (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type where possible). The snippet only shows use of a const-qualified pointer to a struct (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param). That makes the member expression param->value.str have type char * const if the struct member was declared as char *str (the pointer itself is const because the containing struct is const), but that is a type-use \u2014 not a declaration in this function. The rule is applied at the point of declaration of the pointer type (the struct definition), and we do not have that definition here, so you cannot conclude a violation from this function alone. Also, passing param->value.str (char * const) to memcmp or to functions that take const char*/const void* is allowed (implicit conversion to pointer-to-const), and the code does not attempt to modify the pointed-to data. If the intent is that the pointed-to data is immutable, the correct change would be to declare the struct member as const char *str; but without the struct declaration or evidence that the data must be immutable, the agent\u2019s claim that this function violates Rule 8.13 is not justified."
