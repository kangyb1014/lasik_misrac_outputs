  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are manifestly invariant. Details:\n- The two mhd_assert(...) calls are assertions that test runtime values (param->value.str and param->value.len). Even if mhd_assert is a macro that expands to a control statement, its controlling expression depends on param and is therefore not an invariant compile-time constant.\n- The if (param->quoted) uses a struct member whose value is determined at runtime, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- The final return uses a Boolean expression combining a length comparison and memcmp result; this is an expression evaluated for its value, not a control statement (it does not introduce selection or iteration), so MISRA C Rule 14.3 does not apply to it.\n- There are no loops or other selection constructs with constant controlling expressions (no while, for, switch with constant controlling expressions) in the provided code.\nAccordingly, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
