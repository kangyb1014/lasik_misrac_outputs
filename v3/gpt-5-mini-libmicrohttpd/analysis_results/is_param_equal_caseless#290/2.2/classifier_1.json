Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal_caseless:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal_caseless (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                         const char *const str,\n                         const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the return in the if(param->quoted) branch is conditional on runtime data (param->quoted) and therefore is not dead code. Removal of that branch would change program behaviour when param->quoted can be true. (It would only be a violation if, across the whole project, param->quoted is provably always false or always true so the branch is never/always executed \u2014 e.g. param->quoted is a compile\u2011time constant or is never set to true \u2014 in which case that branch would be dead.)"
