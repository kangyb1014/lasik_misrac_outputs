  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs are standard C (use of const, struct, pointer dereference, size_t, bool, simple conditional, return, and the C library function memcmp) and do not by themselves indicate compiler-specific language extensions. There are no explicit compiler-extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (unprefixed), __builtin_... or other vendor-specific keywords in the rest of the fragment. Identifier naming (leading underscores or project-specific prefixes) can be a naming-reservation issue but is not, by itself, a language extension; therefore other lines need not be investigated for Rule 1.2."
