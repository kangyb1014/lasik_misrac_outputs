The pointer should therefore be declared as 'const struct MemoryPool *pool'. Because the pointer is not const-qualified, Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the absence of contrary API constraints. The function only reads members of *pool (pool->end and pool->pos) and does not modify the pointee; neither mhd_assert nor ROUND_TO_ALIGN require a non-const pointer. Therefore, per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the parameter should be declared as const struct MemoryPool *pool. The only caveats that would justify keeping the non-const parameter are external factors not visible here (API/ABI compatibility, required prototype matching, or other uses that need a non-const pointer). Given only the shown code, this is a violation."
