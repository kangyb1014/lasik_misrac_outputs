  "explanation": "The fragments listed above include function-like calls or conditions that should be inspected to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_pool_get_free. All other lines in the function are simple arithmetic, comparisons, preprocessor directives or the final return expression and contain no additional function calls; therefore they cannot introduce recursion and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
