  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_get_free:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_pool_get_free (struct MemoryPool *pool)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n#ifdef MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE\n  if ((pool->end - pool->pos) <= _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE)\n    return 0;\n#endif /* MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE */\n  return (pool->end - pool->pos) - _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for typical assert usage. In common implementations mhd_assert is either (a) compiled out in release builds (so it is not executed \u2014 and MISRA Note 2 says unreachable/not executed code is not dead code) or (b) has a side effect on failure (e.g. calls an assert-failure handler/abort), so removing it would change program behaviour. Therefore, based on the fragment alone there is no evidence of MISRA Rule 2.2 violation. \n\nSpecific violation scenario (hypothetical): if mhd_assert is defined such that it expands to an expression or function call that is executed in all builds, has no side effects, and the tested condition is always true at runtime (so the check only evaluates a condition but does not affect state or timing), then that executed operation could be considered dead code because removing it would not affect program behaviour."
