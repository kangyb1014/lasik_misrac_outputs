True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert invocation is dead code when it has no observable effect (e.g. the assert macro is a no-op in production builds or the condition is provably always true). Example: if mhd_assert expands to ((void)0) for non\u2011debug builds, or the expression pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos is guaranteed by other code/analysis, then executing that assertion (or keeping it compiled in) has no effect on program behaviour and its removal would not change behaviour \u2014 this is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert can change behaviour \u2014 e.g. it can abort, log, or otherwise affect timing/state \u2014 then it would not be dead code.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not enough information to conclude the claim is definitely correct. Whether the mhd_assert calls constitute dead code depends on how mhd_assert is defined and on whether its removal could change program behaviour.\n\n\u2022 If mhd_assert is implemented as a no\u2011op in the delivered project (for example it expands to ((void)0) in production builds) or the asserted condition is provably always true and the assertion has no side effects, then the assertion statement executes but removing it would not affect program behaviour \u2014 that would meet MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code, so the report would be correct.\n\n\u2022 If mhd_assert can have observable effects (abort, logging, instrumentation, modify volatile state, influence timing in a way that matters, etc.) or is present in some build configurations used by the project, then the assertion is not dead code and the report is incorrect.\n\nThe provided source alone does not show the definition of mhd_assert or the project build/configuration policy, so the agent\u2019s blanket claim is not deterministically provable from the snippet. To decide definitively, inspect the mhd_assert macro/implementation and the builds used by the project."
