  "explanation": "The only location in this function that can produce code that is never compiled or never executed is the preprocessor-controlled block selecting the fdset size. Depending on whether HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined at compile time, one of the branches will be omitted entirely; that can create code that is unreachable in a given build configuration and thus should be reviewed. At runtime the ternary expression (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ? ... : ...) uses a non-constant condition, so both arms are potentially reachable at execution time; therefore no other lines in the function present obvious unreachable-code concerns. The rest of the function consists of a single return calling MHD_get_fdset2 with the selected value and has no statements after a return or constant-false condition that would indicate unreachable code."
