  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_fdset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               fd_set *read_fd_set,\n               fd_set *write_fd_set,\n               fd_set *except_fd_set,\n               MHD_socket *max_fd)\n{\n  return MHD_get_fdset2 (daemon,\n                         read_fd_set,\n                         write_fd_set,\n                         except_fd_set,\n                         max_fd,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                         daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                         ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                         ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is an explicit conversion used as the value passed to MHD_get_fdset2 when daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app is true (and only compiled when HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined). This conversion participates in the computed argument value and can affect behavior (e.g. by truncation or ensuring the expected unsigned int type). Removing it could change the value or type and thus program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
