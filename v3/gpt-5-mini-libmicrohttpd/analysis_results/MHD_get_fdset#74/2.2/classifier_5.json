  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_fdset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               fd_set *read_fd_set,\n               fd_set *write_fd_set,\n               fd_set *except_fd_set,\n               MHD_socket *max_fd)\n{\n  return MHD_get_fdset2 (daemon,\n                         read_fd_set,\n                         write_fd_set,\n                         except_fd_set,\n                         max_fd,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                         daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                         ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                         ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "Cannot determine dead-code from this fragment alone. The function definition itself is not dead code unless it is never referenced/called (and no external linkage usage such as registration or function-pointer/table entry exists). A concrete violating scenario would be: MHD_get_fdset is not called anywhere in the program, is not exposed to external modules, and the linker map shows the symbol unused\u2014removing the function (and its wrapper) produces no change in program behaviour. In that case the function is dead and would violate Rule 2.2."
