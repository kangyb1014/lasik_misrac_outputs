  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_fdset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               fd_set *read_fd_set,\n               fd_set *write_fd_set,\n               fd_set *except_fd_set,\n               MHD_socket *max_fd)\n{\n  return MHD_get_fdset2 (daemon,\n                         read_fd_set,\n                         write_fd_set,\n                         except_fd_set,\n                         max_fd,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                         daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                         ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                         ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment uses preprocessor conditionals to select one of two compiled expressions. When HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined the ternary operator selects at runtime between daemon->fdset_size and the default value (both operands can affect behavior), and when the macro is not defined only the default value is compiled. The branch excluded by the preprocessor is not part of the built program (and thus not \u201cdead code\u201d in the sense of Rule 2.2). Removal of either compiled branch would change program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
