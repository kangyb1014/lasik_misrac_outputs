  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_fdset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               fd_set *read_fd_set,\n               fd_set *write_fd_set,\n               fd_set *except_fd_set,\n               MHD_socket *max_fd)\n{\n  return MHD_get_fdset2 (daemon,\n                         read_fd_set,\n                         write_fd_set,\n                         except_fd_set,\n                         max_fd,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                         daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                         ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                         ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The ternary expression selects between daemon->fdset_size and _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE at run time based on daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app. Both arms are potentially executed depending on the value of that run-time flag, so removal of either arm would change program behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated for this fragment. (Note: if, in the specific project, daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app were provably a compile-time constant so one arm can never be taken, then the never-taken arm would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
