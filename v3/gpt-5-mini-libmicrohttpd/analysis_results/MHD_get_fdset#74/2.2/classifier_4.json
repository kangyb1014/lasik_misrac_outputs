  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_fdset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               fd_set *read_fd_set,\n               fd_set *write_fd_set,\n               fd_set *except_fd_set,\n               MHD_socket *max_fd)\n{\n  return MHD_get_fdset2 (daemon,\n                         read_fd_set,\n                         write_fd_set,\n                         except_fd_set,\n                         max_fd,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                         daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                         ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                         ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment simply calls MHD_get_fdset2 with an argument selected either by a runtime ternary (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ? ... : ...) when HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined, or a single constant expression when it is not. There are no executed operations whose removal would not change program behaviour. The #ifdef only controls what is compiled (not dead code at runtime), and both ternary branches are potentially reachable at runtime, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
