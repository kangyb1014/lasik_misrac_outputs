  "explanation": "The provided function MHD_get_fdset contains no use of memcmp nor any other string-comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, etc.). It only returns a call to MHD_get_fdset2 and computes an unsigned int fdset size via a conditional expression/macros and casts; there is no manipulation or comparison of null\u2011terminated strings in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: if memcmp (or other string comparisons) appear inside MHD_get_fdset2 or elsewhere in the codebase, those locations would need separate inspection \u2014 they are not part of the provided fragment."
