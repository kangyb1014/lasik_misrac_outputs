  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and whether they should point to const-qualified data. The code contains a single pointer declaration in the function signature (argv) and multiple uses of argv[i] passed to functions that take const char* parameters. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-manipulating expressions in this function: local variables (i, port_value) are non-pointer integral types; assignments to daemon_port and the various force_* / allow_rfc2069 flags are scalar assignments, not pointer operations; casts like (unsigned int) argc and (uint16_t) port_value do not introduce pointer concerns; string literals are already const. Therefore only the function parameter and its uses (the fragments listed) need investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13 \u2014 no other fragments in this function are relevant to that rule."
