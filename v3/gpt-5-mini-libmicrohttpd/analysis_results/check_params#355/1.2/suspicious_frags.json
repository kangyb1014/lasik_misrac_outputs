  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided code. I searched for common compiler-specific constructs that would constitute extensions (examples include: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC/Clang/MSC pragmas or keywords like __extension__, __inline__ (non-standard forms), MSVC __stdcall/__cdecl decorations, inline assembly, or non-standard builtin types). The code only uses standard C constructs: function declaration and definition, standard pointer/const qualifiers (char *const *const), standard integer types (size_t, uint16_t from <stdint.h> which is part of the C standard library), standard library calls (strcmp, sscanf, fprintf, printf), ordinary casts, and adjacent string literal concatenation (a standard feature). Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
