  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the function is a compile-time or run-time invariant that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All control statements depend on mutable inputs or variables:\n- if (2 > argc): depends on the parameter argc, not invariant.\n- for (i = 1; i < (unsigned int) argc; ++i): loop condition depends on i (which is incremented) and argc, so it is not invariant.\n- if (0 == strcmp (argv[i], \"--md5\")), else if (0 == strcmp (argv[i], \"--sha256\")), else if (0 == strcmp (argv[i], \"--sha512-256\")), else if ((1 == sscanf (argv[i], \"%u\", &port_value)) && (0 < port_value) && (65535 >= port_value)): all depend on argv[i], sscanf results, or port_value and therefore are not invariant.\n- else if (0 == strcmp (argv[i], \"--allow-rfc2069\")): depends on argv[i].\n- if (force_sha512_256): this tests a variable that is assigned within the function based on parsed arguments, so it is not a statically invariant controlling expression.\n\nAlso note that assignments using the literal expression (! 0) are not controlling expressions and thus outside the scope of Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no suspicious fragments requiring further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
