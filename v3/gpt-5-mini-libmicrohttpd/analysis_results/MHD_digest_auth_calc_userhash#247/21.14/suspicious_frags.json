  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp or any code that compares null-terminated strings via memcmp in the provided function. The only string operations are strlen(username) and strlen(realm) (used to pass explicit lengths to calc_userhash), and there are no strcmp/memcmp/byte-wise comparisons of C strings in this snippet. The binary buffer userhash_bin is handled via a size check (digest_get_size (&da) > bin_buf_size) rather than by comparing null-terminated strings.\n\nNote: functions called from this snippet (calc_userhash, digest_init_one_time, digest_get_size, digest_deinit, digest_ext_error) are not shown; their internal implementations could potentially use memcmp incorrectly, but those implementations are outside the provided code and therefore cannot be flagged here. If you want those inspected for Rule 21.14, provide their source."
