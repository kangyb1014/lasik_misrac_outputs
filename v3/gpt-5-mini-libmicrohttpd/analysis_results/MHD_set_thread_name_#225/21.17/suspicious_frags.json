  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. The code only (a) checks thread_name for NULL and (b) calls platform-specific thread-name APIs (pthread_setname_np, pthread_set_name_np, pthread_setname_np with three args). Those APIs are not functions from <string.h>, so Rule 21.17 (which concerns uses of the <string.h> functions and their pointer parameters) does not apply to any fragment in this function. The NULL check prevents an immediate dereference of a NULL pointer in this function; any further concerns about how the platform thread-name functions use the string (for example, internal truncation or length limits) are outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 21.17 as written, because they are not direct uses of the <string.h> functions within this code."
