  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_thread_name_:\n```c\nstatic int\nMHD_set_thread_name_ (const MHD_thread_ID_native_ thread_id,\n                      const char *thread_name)\n{\n  if (NULL == thread_name)\n    return 0;\n\n#if defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU)\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD)\n  /* FreeBSD and OpenBSD use different function name and void return type */\n  pthread_set_name_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n  return ! 0;\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD)\n  /* NetBSD use 3 arguments: second argument is string in printf-like format,\n   *                         third argument is a single argument for printf();\n   * OSF1 use 3 arguments too, but last one always must be zero (NULL).\n   * MHD doesn't use '%' in thread names, so both form are used in same way.\n   */\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name, 0);\n#endif /* HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\npthread_set_name_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n  return ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call to pthread_set_name_np(thread_id, thread_name) has an observable side\u2013effect (it sets the thread name), and the subsequent return !0 simply returns the constant 1. Removing the pthread_set_name_np call would change program behaviour (thread naming and possibly timing), so the code is not dead. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
