  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: thread_name is declared as const char * so the pointer points to a const-qualified type. (Note/caveat: if MHD_thread_ID_native_ is itself a pointer typedef, writing const MHD_thread_ID_native_ makes the pointer const, not the pointee \u2014 that could be a violation if the intent was to point to a const-qualified pointee. Also a violation would occur if thread_name were declared as char * instead of const char *.)"
