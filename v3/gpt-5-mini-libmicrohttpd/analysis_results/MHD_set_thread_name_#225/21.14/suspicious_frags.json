  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The function MHD_set_thread_name_ only checks for NULL on thread_name and then calls various pthread set-name APIs (pthread_setname_np, pthread_set_name_np, pthread_setname_np with three args). There are no memcmp calls and no manual byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings in any branch. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
