  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function calls MHD_set_thread_name_ (the function itself), either directly or indirectly. The only function calls present are to pthread_setname_np / pthread_set_name_np / pthread_setname_np (OS/library functions). These are external library functions (not defined here) and there is no use of function pointers, callbacks, or macros in this translation unit that would expand to a call back into MHD_set_thread_name_. The NULL check and the preprocessor-controlled branches simply select which external pthread function to invoke; none of those branches contain a self-call or any local indirect call mechanism that could create recursion. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.2 (prohibition of direct or indirect self-calls)."
