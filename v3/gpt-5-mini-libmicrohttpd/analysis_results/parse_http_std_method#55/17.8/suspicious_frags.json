  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning: \u2022 The parameters are: connection (pointer), method (const char *), and len (size_t). None of these parameter variables are assigned to or re\u2011bound in the function. \u2022 The local alias is declared as const char *const m = method; this creates a local const pointer and does not modify the parameter 'method' (and prevents modification of the local pointer). \u2022 The only modification performed is to connection->rq.http_mthd, which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter 'connection' \u2014 this is explicitly allowed by the rule. \u2022 memcmp and the mhd_assert calls only read parameters. Therefore there are no occurrences of modifying a parameter (nor of reassigning a pointer parameter) to flag under Rule 17.8."
