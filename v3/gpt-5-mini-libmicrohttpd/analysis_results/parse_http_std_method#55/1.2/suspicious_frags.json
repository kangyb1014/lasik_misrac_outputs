  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: function definition, pointer and const qualifiers, a local const pointer alias, standard library call (memcmp), integer comparisons, if/else chains, and comments (including /**< which is a Doxygen-style comment but still a standard C comment). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_ functions, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords. The only items that might conceal extensions are the macros (e.g. MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_*, mhd_assert). Macro invocations themselves are standard C usage; any extension would be in their definitions, which are not present in this snippet. If those macro definitions contain compiler-specific extensions, those definitions should be inspected. Based on the visible code alone, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
