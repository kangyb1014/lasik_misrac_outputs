  "explanation": "No syntactically unreachable code fragments are present in the provided function. There are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, goto statements, or preprocessor-disabled blocks that would make any statements impossible to reach. The assignment \"const char *const m = method;\" and the subsequent mhd_assert checks are executed on every call (they are not followed by code that would make later statements unreachable). The cascade of if / else if / else branches are mutually exclusive at runtime but each branch is potentially reachable depending on the runtime values of len and the contents of m; the final else provides a reachable default. Although the mhd_assert checks express preconditions (and could be compiled out in some builds), that does not create unreachable code \u2014 it merely documents required caller behavior. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
