  "scenario": "No violation. The code assigns a function-pointer handler (MHD_UpgradeHandler) into the response struct: response->upgrade_handler = upgrade_handler;. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns adding const to pointers to data that are not modified; const-qualifying function types is meaningless and function pointers are not subject to that advice. Therefore this assignment does not violate Rule 8.13. (If, instead, upgrade_handler were a data pointer and the pointed-to object is only read, that would be a violation and the parameter/member should be a pointer-to-const.)"
