  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. Passing the string literal \"Upgrade\" to MHD_add_response_header does not itself invoke any <string.h> functions or cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. A rule 21.17 violation would occur only if the implementation of MHD_add_response_header copied the supplied string into a buffer that was too small (for example, using strcpy into a fixed-size buffer without length checks). To comply, MHD_add_response_header must ensure destination buffers are large enough or use length\u2011bounded functions and check lengths before copying."
