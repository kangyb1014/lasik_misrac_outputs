  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are simple checks, assignments, or control-flow statements that do not involve function calls and therefore cannot directly or indirectly produce recursion. Examples not selected for investigation: the function signature and parameters, the NULL checks and immediate returns (e.g. \"if (NULL == upgrade_handler) return NULL;\" and the subsequent \"if (NULL == response) return NULL;\"), the preprocessor conditional block delimiters, the assignments to response fields (upgrade_handler, upgrade_handler_cls, total_size, reference_count), and the final \"return response;\". These contain no function invocations and thus cannot participate in direct or indirect self-calls; they are safe with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
