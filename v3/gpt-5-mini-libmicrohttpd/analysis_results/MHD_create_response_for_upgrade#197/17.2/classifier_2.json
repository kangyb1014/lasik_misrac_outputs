  "scenario": "No violation in the provided fragment: the code calls a distinct function MHD_mutex_init_ and does not show MHD_create_response_for_upgrade calling itself. Rule 17.2 would only be violated if there were recursion \u2014 for example, if MHD_mutex_init_ were implemented (or defined via a macro) to call MHD_create_response_for_upgrade (indirect recursion), or if MHD_mutex_init_ were the same function as MHD_create_response_for_upgrade (direct self-call). With the given code there is no evidence of such recursion."
