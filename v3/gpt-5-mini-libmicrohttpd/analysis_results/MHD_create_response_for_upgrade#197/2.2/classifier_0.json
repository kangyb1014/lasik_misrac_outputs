  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_for_upgrade:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_for_upgrade (MHD_UpgradeHandler upgrade_handler,\n                                 void *upgrade_handler_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  if (NULL == upgrade_handler)\n    return NULL; /* invalid request */\n  response = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response));\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The response object is allocated by MHD_calloc_ (a calloc-style allocator that zero-initializes the memory). Because the memory is already zeroed, the executed statement response->total_size = 0; has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour. Therefore this assignment is redundant (dead) code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If MHD_calloc_ did not zero memory\u2014i.e. it behaves like malloc\u2014then the assignment would be required and not a violation.)"
