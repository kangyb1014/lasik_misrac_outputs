  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 because they are functional, not dead: the NULL check of upgrade_handler and the NULL check after allocation are necessary control-flow/error handling; setting response->upgrade_handler and response->upgrade_handler_cls assigns required runtime values; response->reference_count = 1 sets a non-zero reference count and is semantically required; the mutex init and its error-path (free/return) are platform-dependent initialization and error handling; the call to MHD_add_response_header and the subsequent cleanup on failure are required side-effecting operations. The allocation (MHD_calloc_) and the checks are active, reachable code that affect behavior. Therefore only the assignment of total_size appears to be potentially redundant and should be investigated further for dead-code status."
