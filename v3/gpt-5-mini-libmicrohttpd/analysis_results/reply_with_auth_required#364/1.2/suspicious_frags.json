  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the supplied code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: local static const arrays, sizeof on arrays, enum and struct types, standard function calls, (void) cast to ignore a return value, adjacent string literal concatenation and backslash-newline line continuation (both handled by the standard preprocessor), and macro identifiers (REALM, OPAQUE_DATA, SEC_AREA1_URL, SEC_AREA2_URL) which are normal preprocessor symbols. There are no uses of compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_* intrinsics, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other non-standard keywords/operators. The MHD_* identifiers are library API names, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
