  "explanation": "I examined the function and excluded all other fragments from further investigation because they are clearly active and affect program behaviour: the static string definitions are compile-time initializations (note 3 of the rule: initializations are not candidates for dead code); the conditional resp creation (if/else) is used later and selects the actual response buffer; the NULL check on resp and the immediate return on failure are necessary control-flow and not removable; MHD_destroy_response(resp) and the return ret are required for correct resource management and to propagate the result. The string literal concatenation (SEC_AREA1_URL \" \" SEC_AREA2_URL) is a compile-time construct and not dead. In short, only the listed fragments appear potentially redundant or worth checking for dead-code concerns; the remainder of the function contains operations that clearly contribute to observable behaviour and therefore do not meet the definition of dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
