  "explanation": "The provided code fragment contains no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or other functions that perform string comparisons. All operations are time calculations, conditional checks on numeric delta, I/O (fprintf), and memory deallocation (free). Therefore there are no occurrences in this fragment that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). No other lines perform string comparisons or use memcmp, so nothing here needs further investigation for that specific rule."
