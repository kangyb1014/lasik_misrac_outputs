  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation under Rule 8.13 because they do not present pointer-to-object qualification issues: tve is a local struct (not a pointer) and is written by gettimeofday, so it cannot be made const; the delta arithmetic uses integer types and casts (no pointer qualification applicable); the small_deltas array is explicitly modified (writes to an array element), so const-qualification of that object is not appropriate; fprintf and the PRIu64 usage are formatting/IO operations and not related to pointer qualification. These parts therefore do not warrant further inspection for Rule 8.13."
