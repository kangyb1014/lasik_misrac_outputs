Declaring it non-const when no modification occurs violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Although tv is only dereferenced for read access, it is passed to free(tv) at the end. free has prototype void free(void *); making tv a pointer-to-const would require casting away const to pass it to free (or otherwise change the code), which is not \u201cwhenever possible.\u201d Thus tv cannot be made const without introducing a qualifier-discarding cast (and likely causing other MISRA violations). Therefore the agent A report that this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
