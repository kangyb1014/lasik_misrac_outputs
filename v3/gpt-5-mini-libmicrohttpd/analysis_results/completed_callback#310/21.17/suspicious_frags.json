  "explanation": "No use of any functions from <string.h> is present in the provided code fragment. The MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns the Standard Library string-handling functions (examples: memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The completed_callback implementation contains only: local pointer dereference, gettimeofday, integer arithmetic, a bounds check (delta < SMALL) before indexing small_deltas, fprintf to stdout, and free. None of these are calls to the listed <string.h> functions.\n\nDetails by fragment:\n- gettimeofday(&tve, NULL): not a <string.h> function; no string-buffer access.\n- delta calculation and comparisons: plain integer arithmetic and casting; no string handling.\n- small_deltas[delta] increment guarded by (delta < SMALL): the bounds check prevents out-of-bounds indexing, so this indexing is not suspicious for Rule 21.17 (though it should be checked for correctness in other MISRA contexts if SMALL and small_deltas are defined elsewhere).\n- fprintf(stdout, \"D: %\" PRIu64 \" 1\\n\", delta): fprintf is a stdio function, not from <string.h>. While library implementations of fprintf may internally call string routines, the source-level use here is not a direct use of any <string.h> function named in Rule 21.17. The format string uses the PRIu64 macro (from <inttypes.h>) which only affects the conversion specifier and does not introduce a string.h call.\n- free(tv): deallocation, not a string function.\n\nGiven the absence of calls to the string.h functions listed by Rule 21.17, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be flagged for investigation under that specific rule."
