Because it is an operation executed at runtime (an expression statement) but has no effect, it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The three lines such as '(void) cls;' are expression statements that are executed but have no effect; removing them does not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour. That matches the MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour). Thus the completed_callback function contains dead code and violates Rule 2.2. \n\n(If the intent is only to silence compiler warnings about unused parameters, prefer alternatives that do not create executed no-ops: omit parameter identifiers in the function definition/prototype, use a compiler-supported \"unused\" attribute, or use a dedicated macro/annotation that is acceptable under your project\u2019s MISRA compliance policy.)"
