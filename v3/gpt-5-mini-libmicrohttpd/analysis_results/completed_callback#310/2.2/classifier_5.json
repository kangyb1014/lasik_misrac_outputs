Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of completed_callback:\n```c\nstatic void\ncompleted_callback (void *cls,\n                    struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                    void **req_cls,\n                    enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct timeval *tv = *req_cls;\n  struct timeval tve;\n  uint64_t delta;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment itself (a static function definition) is not provably dead just from the declaration. However, if the function is static and there are no calls or references to completed_callback anywhere in the translation unit or project, the function definition would be dead code and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Likewise, within the full function body the explicit (void) cls; (and similar) statements are operations that have no runtime effect \u2014 their removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 so if present they would also be considered dead operations. Based only on the provided fragment, no violation can be confirmed."
