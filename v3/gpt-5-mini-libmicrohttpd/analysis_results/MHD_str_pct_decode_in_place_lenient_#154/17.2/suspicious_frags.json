  "explanation": "No direct self-call to MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ is present in this function body. The only places that could participate in indirect recursion are the function calls shown above; they should be investigated to determine whether any of them (directly or indirectly) call MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_. Other code fragments do not contain function calls (they are local assignments, control flow, casts, array indexing, returns, or literal/constant operations) and therefore cannot introduce recursion, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
