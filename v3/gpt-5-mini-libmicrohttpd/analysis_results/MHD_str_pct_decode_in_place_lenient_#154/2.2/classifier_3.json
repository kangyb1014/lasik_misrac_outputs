  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (char *str,\n                                      bool *broken_encoding)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  size_t len;\n  size_t res;\n\n  len = strlen (str);\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_ (str, len, str, len, broken_encoding);\n  str[res] = 0;\n\n  return res;\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment under MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE performs strlen into 'len', calls MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_ with 'len' as parameter, writes a terminator at str[res] and returns res. Each operation affects the function's observable behavior (the call uses 'len', the null-termination at str[res] changes the buffer contents, and the return value is used by callers). Thus these operations are not dead. Conditional compilation excludes this code when MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE is not defined, but that is a build-time inclusion decision, not dead code in the sense of an executed operation that could be removed without changing behavior. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
