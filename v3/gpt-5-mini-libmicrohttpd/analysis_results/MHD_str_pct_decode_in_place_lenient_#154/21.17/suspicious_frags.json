  "explanation": "Only the small-code path contains calls to functions from <string.h>. The call to strlen(...) is a direct use of a <string.h> function and must be investigated to ensure it does not read past the bounds of the object pointed to by str (e.g. if str is not NUL-terminated). The subsequent use of the returned length (passed into MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_) and the write to str[res] depend on that length and therefore should be reviewed together with the strlen usage. All other code fragments in the function do not call any <string.h> functions: the main decoding loop performs explicit indexed accesses and explicit NUL ('\\0') checks and does not invoke standard string-handling routines covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Those indexed accesses, while potentially relevant to other MISRA rules (bounds checking, pointer validity), are not subject to Rule 21.17 and thus are not listed as suspicious for this specific rule."
