  "explanation": "Only the use of the macro-like token _MHD_EXTERN is flagged because such macros commonly expand to compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__(...)) which are language/compiler extensions and must be verified against compiler documentation. All other elements in the fragment are standard C constructs: the function definition/syntax, size_t, void*, a typedef name (MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback), and the function call are standard C and do not by themselves indicate use of a compiler extension. The use of identifiers beginning with an underscore is a naming/reservation concern but is not a compiler language extension; it should be reviewed under other MISRA rules if needed, not under Rule 1.2 unless it expands to a compiler-specific extension (which is why the macro is the only flagged item)."
