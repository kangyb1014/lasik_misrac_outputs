  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback (size_t size,\n                                                    void *buffer,\n                                                    MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback\n                                                    crfc)\n{\n  return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 crfc,\n                                                                 buffer);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 crfc,\n                                                                 buffer)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is an active call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls that returns the function result; removing it would change program behavior. Passing the same 'buffer' pointer twice is a parameter choice (likely intentional) and does not make the call or its arguments dead code."
