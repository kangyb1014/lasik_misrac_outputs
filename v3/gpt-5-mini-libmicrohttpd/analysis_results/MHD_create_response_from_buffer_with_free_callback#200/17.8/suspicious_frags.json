  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. In the function body the parameters (size, buffer, crfc) are only used as rvalues in a single function call and are not assigned to, incremented/decremented, subjected to pointer arithmetic, or otherwise modified. Passing a pointer parameter (buffer) as an argument to another function does not modify the pointer parameter itself here \u2014 the rule permits modifying the object pointed to, but forbids modifying the pointer variable. Therefore there is no apparent violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
