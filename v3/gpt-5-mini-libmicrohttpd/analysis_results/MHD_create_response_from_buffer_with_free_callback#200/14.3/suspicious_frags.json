  "explanation": "The provided function contains no loop or conditional controlling expressions to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 applies. The body is a single return statement that calls another function; there are no for, while, or do-while constructs, and no invariant controlling expressions. There are also no macros or compile-time constructs in this fragment that would introduce an invariant controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
