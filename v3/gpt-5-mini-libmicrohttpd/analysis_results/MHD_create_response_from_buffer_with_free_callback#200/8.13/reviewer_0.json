True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe wrapper takes a non-const pointer (void *buffer) and simply forwards it to the _cls variant. If the data/closure pointed to by buffer is not modified by this function or the callee, the parameter should be declared as const void * (and the forwarded argument should be const) \u2014 i.e. the pointer target is missing a const qualifier. Therefore this use (accepting and forwarding a void * instead of a const-qualified pointer) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should be const-qualified when it can be; but that only applies where the pointee is actually immutable in the API. In this code the buffer argument is forwarded as the closure/cls argument to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls. The closure/ free-callback API expects a void * (mutable) because the callback may free or otherwise treat the data as mutable. Making the wrapper parameter const void * would either be incorrect for the downstream API or force a cast to void * when forwarding (which would itself be problematic). Therefore the pointer cannot (and should not) be declared const here and no Rule 8.13 violation exists."
