  "explanation": "I found a single controlling expression: if ((MHD_PanicCallback) NULL != cb). This expression depends on the function parameter cb and therefore is not invariant at compile time \u2014 it can evaluate differently for different calls. There are no loops (while, for, do-while) or other controlling expressions in the function that could be constant or otherwise invariant. The cast of NULL to MHD_PanicCallback does not make the controlling expression invariant. No do-while with a compile-time false, nor any intentional infinite-loop pattern, is present. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
