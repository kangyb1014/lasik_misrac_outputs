  "explanation": "No unreachable code patterns were identified in the provided function. The conditional uses the runtime value of cb so both the 'if' and 'else' branches are potentially reachable depending on the argument; there are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, fall-throughs, or statements after an unconditional jump that would make code unreachable. The final assignment to mhd_panic_cls is executed unconditionally. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
