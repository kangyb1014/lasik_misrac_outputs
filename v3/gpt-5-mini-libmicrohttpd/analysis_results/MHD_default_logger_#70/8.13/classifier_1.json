  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The void *cls is cast to FILE * and passed to vfprintf, which performs I/O and modifies the FILE object (internal buffers/state). Therefore the pointer must not be to a const-qualified type; making it const would prevent the required modification. If cls pointed to data that is not modified, it should be const, but in this use it is correctly non-const."
