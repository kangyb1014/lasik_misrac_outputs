  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, void* and const char* pointers, the standard type va_list (from <stdarg.h>), and the standard library functions vfprintf and fflush (from <stdio.h>). The casts (FILE *)cls are standard C pointer casts. The conditional compilation using #ifdef _DEBUG is a standard preprocessor feature (the macro name itself may be implementation- or build-system-defined, but its use is not a compiler language extension). There are no compiler-specific keywords (for example __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm), no inline assembler, no statement expressions, no nonstandard storage-class specifiers, and no other documented compiler extensions present. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
