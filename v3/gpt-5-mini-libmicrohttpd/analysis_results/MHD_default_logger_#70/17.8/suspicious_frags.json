  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The code only uses the parameters as arguments (casts cls to FILE * for use in vfprintf/fflush and passes fm and ap to vfprintf). There are no assignments to cls, fm or ap, no increments/decrements, and no operations that change the pointer values themselves. Casting (FILE *) cls does not modify the parameter. The va_list ap is passed to vfprintf but not reused or assigned to inside this function, so the parameter variable is not modified here. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
