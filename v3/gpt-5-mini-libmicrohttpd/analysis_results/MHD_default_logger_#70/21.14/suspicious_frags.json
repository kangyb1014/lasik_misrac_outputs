  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function. It calls vfprintf((FILE *)cls, fm, ap) and fflush((FILE *)cls) under _DEBUG; there are no calls to memcmp anywhere in this fragment, nor any use of memcmp-like comparisons of null-terminated strings. The only standard library functions used are vfprintf and fflush, which are unrelated to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
