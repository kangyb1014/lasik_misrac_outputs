  "explanation": "No suspicious unreachable-code fragments were identified. Reasoning: \n- The top-level while loop is conditioned on args being non-NULL and not empty, so the loop body is reachable whenever the caller passes a non-empty args string; the function returns MHD_YES when the loop completes, which is reachable when args becomes NULL/empty or when a break executes. \n- The branch when (NULL == amper) covers the case where no '&' is present; inside it there are two mutually exclusive subcases (NULL == equals) and (equals != NULL). Both subcases are reachable depending on the input string (e.g. \"foo\" and \"foo=bar\"). The break statements are executed only when the callback returns success; the return MHD_NO statements are conditional on the callback returning MHD_NO, so there is no dead code following an unconditional jump. \n- The branch when amper is non-NULL is reachable when an '&' appears in args. Within that branch the condition (NULL == equals) || (equals >= amper) covers inputs like \"foo&...\" and edge cases such as \"&=...\" where equals may point at or after the incremented amper; these cases are reachable at runtime. The final else (equals and amper non-NULL and equals < amper) handles regular \"foo=value&...\" cases. All three subpaths are reachable for appropriate inputs. \n- There are no statements that follow an unconditional return, no constant-false conditionals, and no code that can never be reached due to the control-flow structure (returns/breaks/continues are all conditional or the natural loop exit). \nGiven the above, there is no code in this function that is demonstrably unreachable and therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
