  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function contains no function calls (no direct calls to itself or to any other function), does not invoke function pointers or callbacks, and only reads/writes structure members and returns constant enum values. The commented-out condition is inert and contains no calls. Because there are no calls from this function to any other function, there is no possibility of direct or indirect recursion originating here and no code fragment in this function requires further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
