  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: static storage class, enum types, struct pointer parameter, integer/enum comparisons, assignment, and block comments. The sequence \"/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\" is a commented-out expression and therefore not active code (the literal 'true' does not appear in compiled code). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as inline assembly (asm), GCC/clang attributes (__attribute__), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), builtin functions/macros (__builtin_*), __extension__, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other non-standard language features. User-defined types and macros (enum names, MHD_NO, MHD_YES) are standard C and not language extensions. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for Rule 1.2."
