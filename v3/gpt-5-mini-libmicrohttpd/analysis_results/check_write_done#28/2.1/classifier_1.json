  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment is executed when connection->write_buffer_append_offset == connection->write_buffer_send_offset (i.e. the if condition is false). In that case the function falls through, executes connection->state = next_state, and returns MHD_YES. The commented-out expression has no effect on reachability. Therefore the line is reachable and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
