  "explanation": "The function is short and contains a single conditional early return and the subsequent statements that execute when that condition is false. The only parts that could potentially be unreachable (and thus need investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1) are the conditional and the code that follows it, including the commented-out alternative condition. There are no other statements, labels, switches, loops, or constructs in this function that could introduce unreachable code, so no other fragments require investigation."
