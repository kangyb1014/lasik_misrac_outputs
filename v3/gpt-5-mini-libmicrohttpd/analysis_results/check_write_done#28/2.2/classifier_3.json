  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_write_done:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncheck_write_done (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE next_state)\n{\n  if ( (connection->write_buffer_append_offset !=\n        connection->write_buffer_send_offset)\n       /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\n       )\n    return MHD_NO;\n  connection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n  connection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n  connection->state = next_state;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconnection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment connection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0 is not dead. The function only reaches this assignment when write_buffer_append_offset == write_buffer_send_offset; removing the assignment could change program behaviour because the subsequent line only sets write_buffer_send_offset = 0. If the first assignment were removed, write_buffer_send_offset would become 0 while write_buffer_append_offset would remain at its previous (possibly non\u2011zero) value, breaking the intended invariant and affecting later behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
