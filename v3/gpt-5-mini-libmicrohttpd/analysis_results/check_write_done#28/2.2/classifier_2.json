  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_write_done:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncheck_write_done (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE next_state)\n{\n  if ( (connection->write_buffer_append_offset !=\n        connection->write_buffer_send_offset)\n       /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\n       )\n    return MHD_NO;\n  connection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n  connection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n  connection->state = next_state;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconnection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment clears an independent struct member (write_buffer_send_offset) when the function determines the buffer is done; removing it could change program behaviour if callers/readers observe that field after return. This would only be a Rule 2.2 violation if the write_buffer_send_offset assignment were provably redundant \u2014 e.g. if it is always already zero, aliased to write_buffer_append_offset, or always overwritten before any use \u2014 none of which is established in the shown code."
