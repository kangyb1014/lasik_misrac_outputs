  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function contains no calls to memcmp (or other C standard string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp), and it does not perform comparisons on char pointers or on null\u2011terminated strings. The only comparison is between numeric offsets (connection->write_buffer_append_offset != connection->write_buffer_send_offset), and the rest are simple numeric assignments and state updates. The commented-out expression (/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true */) is inactive and does not introduce memcmp use. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
