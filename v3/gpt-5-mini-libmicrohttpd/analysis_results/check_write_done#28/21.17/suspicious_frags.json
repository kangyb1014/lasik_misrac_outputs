  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions are present in this function: there is no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar. The code only compares and assigns integer offsets (connection->write_buffer_append_offset and connection->write_buffer_send_offset) and sets them to 0 and updates connection->state. There are no buffer copies, pointer arithmetic, or accesses to buffer contents in this fragment. The commented-out condition (data_in_tls_buffers == true) is inactive and does not introduce any string handling. Therefore, nothing in this code fragment needs investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
