  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The only parameter that could be of concern is the pointer parameter 'connection', but the code modifies members of the object pointed to (connection->write_buffer_append_offset, connection->write_buffer_send_offset, connection->state), which is explicitly allowed by the rule. The pointer variable 'connection' itself is not reassigned or modified. The scalar parameter 'next_state' is only read (used to set connection->state) and is not modified. The conditional only reads members and the commented-out expression has no effect. Therefore there are no places in this function where a function parameter itself is modified and nothing here requires further investigation for Rule 17.8."
