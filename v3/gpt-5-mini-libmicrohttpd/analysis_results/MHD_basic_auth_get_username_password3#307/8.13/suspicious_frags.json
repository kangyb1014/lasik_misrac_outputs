  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where appropriate or must remain non-const because the code modifies the pointed-to storage: - params is declared as const struct MHD_RqBAuth *params (correct use of const). - decoded is used as a writable buffer (assigned to by MHD_base64_to_bin_n and modified for zero-termination), so it must be a non-const char*. - The cast and allocation (malloc and (char *)(ret + 1)) are creating/modifying storage and are therefore intentionally non-const. - Local size and length variables (decoded_max_len, decoded_len, username_len, password_len, password_pos) are value types and not subject to pointer const-qualification. The listed fragments were selected because they involve pointers or pointer-typed returns that could plausibly be const-qualified (return type of the function, the ret pointer and the struct members assigned from decoded, and the colon pointer returned by memchr) and thus warrant review to determine whether const qualification is appropriate and consistent with the API/ownership semantics."
