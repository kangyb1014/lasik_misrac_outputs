  "explanation": "I report only the function-definition line that uses the _MHD_EXTERN identifier because that macro often expands to compiler-/platform-specific linkage or attribute annotations (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__((...))), which are implementation extensions documented by compilers and therefore must be inspected to confirm compliance with MISRA C Rule 1.2. Other parts of the function do not themselves indicate use of language/compiler extensions: - The malloc cast and pointer arithmetic (ret = (struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo *) malloc(...); decoded = (char *) (ret + 1);) are standard C and not compiler extensions. - Use of standard library functions (memchr, free, malloc) and types (size_t, NULL) are standard C. - The backslash-newline used to split the long string literal is the standard C line splicing mechanism, not an extension. - The underscore macro _(...) (commonly gettext) and other project macros (mhd_assert, MHD_DLOG, HAVE_MESSAGES) are ordinary macros; they may expand to platform-specific code, but their usage here is a macro invocation rather than a direct use of a known compiler language extension \u2014 their expansions (not shown) would need review if they contain extensions. - Comments, #ifdef/#endif conditional compilation, and return statements shown are standard C. Therefore, other fragments do not by themselves demonstrate direct use of documented compiler language extensions; only the _MHD_EXTERN declaration macro merits investigation."
