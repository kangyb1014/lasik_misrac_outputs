  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the shown code. The source uses standard C constructs: a function definition, a fixed-size array parameter, and the standard uint8_t type. There are no occurrences of common compiler-extension tokens such as __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, statement-expressions (GCC), or other vendor-specific keywords that would be explicitly documented as extensions.\n\nNote: The macro identifier _MHD_EXTERN appears in the code; its expansion is not visible here. If that macro expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__(...)), that expansion would constitute use of a language extension and should be checked by inspecting the macro definition. However, based solely on the provided code fragment, no explicit language extensions are used and therefore no code fragments are reported for investigation."
