  "explanation": "The other pointer parameters are already const-qualified: 'const char *realm' and 'const char *username' are const, and 'const uint8_t digest[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE]' is const-qualified as well. There are no other pointer parameters or local pointer declarations in this function body that could be considered for const qualification. Therefore only the non-const 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' parameter needs investigation to determine whether it could be declared to point to a const-qualified type."
