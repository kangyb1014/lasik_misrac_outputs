  "explanation": "Only the conditional compilation block is reported because it is the only part of the function that can lead to code that is effectively excluded/unused depending on build-time macros (i.e. one of the two branches will not be present in a given build). All other parts of the function (the function signature, the variable declaration inside the compiled branch, the if/return logic within the else-branch, and the final braces) do not contain statements that are unconditionally unreachable in the source as written \u2014 there are no statements following an unconditional return within the same compilation branch, and the control-flow in the compiled branch(s) allows reaching each statement that remains after preprocessing. Therefore no additional fragments need investigation for unreachable-code issues."
