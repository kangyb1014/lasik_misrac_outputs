  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are clearly invariant and thus no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Reasoning by construct:\n\n- There are no iteration statements (for, while, do-while) whose controlling expressions are constant. The function contains only if statements and return statements.\n\n- Every if-condition depends on runtime data or function calls, not on compile-time constant expressions:\n  - if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_ (header, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION)) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of header and the behavior of MHD_str_equal_caseless_.\n  - if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_ (header, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_TRANSFER_ENCODING)) and the nested checks (e.g., ! MHD_str_equal_caseless_(content, \"chunked\")) \u2014 depend on runtime values and function calls.\n  - The bitwise flag checks such as (0 != (response->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_TRANS_ENC_CHUNKED)) and (0 == (MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH & response->flags)) read the runtime response->flags fields; these are not invariant at compile time.\n  - if (MHD_NO != add_response_entry (...)) \u2014 the controlling expression includes a function call (add_response_entry) with potential side effects and runtime result; it is not a compile-time constant.\n  - Date/header handling branches similarly rely on MHD_str_equal_caseless_, MHD_get_response_element_n_, and response fields which are runtime-dependent.\n\n- The mhd_assert (NULL != hdr); statement is not a controlling selection/iteration statement in this function (it is an assertion macro), and its argument is a runtime pointer check produced after a call to MHD_get_response_element_n_. Even if mhd_assert expands to something involving a conditional internally, that expansion is outside the shown code and cannot be assumed to be an invariant controlling expression here.\n\n- There is no do-while with a constant false controlling expression (the listed MISRA exception) or any other allowed exception pattern present.\n\nGiven these points, none of the controlling expressions in the provided function are evidently compile-time invariant; therefore there are no fragments to report for further investigation under Rule 14.3."
