  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (the function signature/return type and the declaration 'uint64_t d_timeout;' and the final 'return (int64_t) d_timeout;' statement) do not introduce conditional control flow that could be statically unreachable: the signature is just a declaration, the local variable declaration does not affect reachability, and the final return is the natural fall-through of the function. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1. The listed fragments contain conditional branches and an assertion that may render subsequent code paths unreachable depending on runtime behavior, platform types/ranges, or how the assertion macro is implemented/compiled out; they should be investigated for possible unreachable code."
