  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I inspected the provided function get_timeout_millisec_. It contains only integer types, integer comparisons, a cast, returns, an assertion, and a call to MHD_get_timeout64. There are no uses of memcmp, no other memory-compare functions (memcmp-like), and no operations on char* or null-terminated strings (no strcmp/strncmp/strcpy/etc.). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14. Note: the call to MHD_get_timeout64 is external to this fragment and does not appear in the provided code; if that external function used memcmp on null-terminated strings it would need review, but it is not present here and thus not included as a suspicious fragment."
