  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_timeout_millisec_:\n```c\nstatic int64_t\nget_timeout_millisec_ (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                       int32_t max_timeout)\n{\n  uint64_t d_timeout;\n  mhd_assert (0 <= max_timeout || -1 == max_timeout);\n  if (0 == max_timeout)\n    return 0;\n\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &d_timeout))\n    return max_timeout;\n\n  if ((0 < max_timeout) && ((uint64_t) max_timeout < d_timeout))\n    return max_timeout;\n\n  if (INT64_MAX <= d_timeout)\n    return INT64_MAX;\n\n  return (int64_t) d_timeout;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn (int64_t) d_timeout;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated. Example reachable path: max_timeout == -1 (or max_timeout > 0 and (uint64_t)max_timeout >= d_timeout), MHD_get_timeout64(daemon,&d_timeout) returns success and sets d_timeout to a value < INT64_MAX (e.g. 1000). In that case none of the earlier returns trigger and the final statement return (int64_t) d_timeout; is executed. Removing it would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
