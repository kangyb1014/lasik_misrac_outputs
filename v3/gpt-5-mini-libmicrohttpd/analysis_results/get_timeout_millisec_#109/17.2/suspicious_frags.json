  "explanation": "The only statements that invoke other functions (and therefore could participate in indirect recursion) are the two calls listed above. No direct call to get_timeout_millisec_ appears in this function. The remaining lines are comparisons, casts, returns and constant checks (e.g. 0 == max_timeout, (uint64_t) max_timeout < d_timeout, INT64_MAX <= d_timeout, and return (int64_t) d_timeout) which do not call any functions and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion. The INT64_MAX token is a constant macro, and there are no function-pointer invocations or other call sites in the rest of the code fragment that would warrant investigation for Rule 17.2."
