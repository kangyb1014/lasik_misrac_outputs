  "explanation": "I flagged all version-guarded blocks and every conditional/return that constructs a response because those are the operations that are executed at runtime and therefore the only plausible places where an operation could be present yet removable without changing behaviour (dead code). In particular: the two mutually exclusive #if/#else branches compile different code depending on MHD_VERSION (one branch may be unused in a given build and needs review), and each branch contains three return paths (body_dyn-present, tool_params.empty, and the final default return) that should be checked for redundancy or no-op behaviour (for example, a call with length 0 and a non-null pointer might be equivalent to an empty-response factory). Other fragments in the function (the function signature, braces, comments, whitespace, and macro names) are structural or non-executable elements and do not represent executed operations that could be dead code, so they do not need investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.2 here."
