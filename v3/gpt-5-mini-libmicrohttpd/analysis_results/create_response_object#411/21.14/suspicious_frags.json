  "explanation": "I inspected the entire create_response_object function. There are no calls to memcmp nor any other string-comparison calls that use memcmp (no explicit memcmp usage, no macros in this fragment that expand to memcmp). The code only calls MHD_create_response_from_buffer[_static] and MHD_create_response_empty and uses identifiers like body_dyn, tiny_body and MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, none of which are memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14 (prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If macros or functions referenced here (e.g. MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) are defined elsewhere, they would need separate review, but within this provided code fragment there is no memcmp usage to inspect."
