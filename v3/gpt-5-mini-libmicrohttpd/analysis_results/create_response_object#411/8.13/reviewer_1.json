True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf tiny_body is not const-qualified (e.g. declared as char tiny_body[] or char *tiny_body pointing to a string literal) and is passed here for read-only use, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type. Concretely: passing a non-const tiny_body to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (or to an API that takes a non-const void *) means a read-only buffer is not declared const \u2014 it should be declared as const char[] or const char * (or the API should accept const void *).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s report is correct in principle. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers which are used only for read-only access should be declared to point to const-qualified types. The snippet calls into libmicrohttpd with buffers (tiny_body, body_dyn) that are only read by the library. If those buffers are declared as non-const (e.g. char tiny_body[] or char *tiny_body) then their declarations violate 8.13 \u2014 they should be declared const (for example: static const char tiny_body[] or const char *tiny_body).\n\nTwo practical points in the shown code reinforce the concern:\n- In the newer-API branch MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static likely takes a const void *, so the logical fix is to make the buffer declarations const. Implicit conversion from non-const to const may compile, but the underlying declaration would still not follow 8.13.\n- In the older-API branch the code casts to (void *) to match an API that expects a non-const pointer; that cast either removes constness (if the buffer were const) or keeps a non-const declaration. Removing const via cast (or keeping a non-const declaration for a read-only buffer) is contrary to the intent of 8.13 and should be avoided.\n\nThe code fragment itself does not show the declarations of tiny_body/body_dyn, so whether a rule violation actually exists depends on those declarations. However, the scenario described by Agent A (buffers declared non-const but used read-only) indeed constitutes a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The correct remedy is to declare these buffers as const and avoid casting away constness when calling legacy APIs."
