  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter is declared as const char *param_name, satisfying the rule. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer variables in this function body that could/should be const-qualified. Uses of stderr (FILE *) and string literals passed to fprintf are not pointer declarations that can be made const in this context and do not indicate a violation of Rule 8.13. Access via param_name[1] is a read-only access consistent with the const qualification. The tool_params members referenced are non-pointer flag fields, so they are not relevant to this rule."
