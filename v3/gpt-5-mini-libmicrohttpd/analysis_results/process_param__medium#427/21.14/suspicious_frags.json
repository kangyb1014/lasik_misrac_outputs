  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any wrapper around it) are present in the provided code. The code fragments perform boolean field checks (tool_params.empty, tool_params.tiny, tool_params.large), call fprintf (which prints strings but does not compare them), assign tool_params.medium = !0, and perform a single-character comparison ('-' == param_name[1]) \u2014 this is a character comparison, not a null-terminated string comparison via memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
