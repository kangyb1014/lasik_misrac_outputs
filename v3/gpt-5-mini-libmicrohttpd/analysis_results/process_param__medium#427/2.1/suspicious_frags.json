  "explanation": "Investigate the three conditional blocks that contain immediate return statements, the assignment to tool_params.medium, and the final return with the ternary expression because these are the points that determine control flow and possible unreachable code. Other parts of the function (the signature, braces, fprintf message text, and whitespace) are structural or reporting code and do not introduce additional control-flow paths that could produce unreachable code; there are no other statements after the final return that could be unreachable. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
