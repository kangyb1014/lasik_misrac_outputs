  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any other string-comparison function are present. The function only performs casts, bitwise operations and returns an enum value: it operates on an enum/integer value (algo3) and integer masks, not on char* or null-terminated strings. There are no string literals, no char pointers, and no function calls that could resolve to memcmp here. Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings) is not applicable and no fragments need investigation."
