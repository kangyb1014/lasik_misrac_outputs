  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the function contains no uses of the <string.h> string-handling functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The fragment has: - no includes or calls to any string.h functions, - no pointer parameters or pointer arithmetic, - no array accesses or memory-copying operations, - only an enum parameter, an unsigned int local, and integer bitwise operations and casts. Therefore there is no risk of accesses beyond object bounds as described by Rule 21.17. (Note: there is a separate minor code oddity \u2014 the same flag appears twice in the mask expression \u2014 but that is unrelated to Rule 21.17 and thus not included for investigation here.)"
