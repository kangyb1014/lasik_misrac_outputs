  "explanation": "No pointers appear in the provided code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible) is not applicable. The function signature uses value parameters and a non-pointer return type (enum MHD_DigestBaseAlgo get_base_digest_algo(enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 algo3)). The only local object is an unsigned int and there are only casts between enum and unsigned int types and bitwise operations. There are no address-of (&) or indirection (*) operations, no pointer declarations, and no pointer arithmetic to examine for const-qualification. Therefore there are no fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13. (Note: other potential issues such as the repeated macro in the mask are unrelated to Rule 8.13 and thus not included.)"
