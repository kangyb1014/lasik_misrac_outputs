    "_MHD_static_inline"
  ],
  "explanation": "I only flagged the _MHD_static_inline token because it is a macro-like identifier that commonly expands to compiler-specific inline attributes or keywords (for example __inline__, __attribute__((always_inline)), __forceinline, etc.). Those expansions can be language/compiler extensions and must be inspected against the compiler documentation to confirm compliance with MISRA Rule 1.2. All other constructs in the snippet are standard C: enum types and declarations, casts between integer and enum, bitwise operations (&, |, ~), unsigned int usage, and the function body syntax are part of standard C and are not compiler language extensions. The repeated use of MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION in the OR expression may be a logic issue but is not a language extension, so it does not need to be investigated for Rule 1.2."
