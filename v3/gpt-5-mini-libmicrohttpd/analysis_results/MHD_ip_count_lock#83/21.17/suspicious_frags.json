  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function uses any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The function only contains: an assertion (mhd_assert), a conditional call to a mutex-lock helper (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex)), a preprocessor conditional, and a cast-to-void to suppress unused-parameter warnings. None of these lines invoke or imply use of the standard string-handling functions, so there are no fragments here that could violate Rule 21.17 and therefore nothing that requires further investigation under that rule."
