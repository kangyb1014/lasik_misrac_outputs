  "explanation": "The rule addresses use of const-qualified pointer target types. I have included every location in this function that involves pointer usage or access to pointer-containing members so they can be checked: the function parameter (a pointer to struct), the access of daemon->master, and taking the address of the per_ip_connection_mutex member. Other parts of the code (the static/void function specifiers, the preprocessor conditional, the (void) daemon; cast in the non-threaded branch, and the surrounding braces) do not introduce additional pointer targets that could be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
