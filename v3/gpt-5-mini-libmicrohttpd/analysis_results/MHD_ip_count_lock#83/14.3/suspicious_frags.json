  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions of selection/iteration statements (if, switch, for, while, do-while) that are invariant. The provided function contains no such controlling statements with constant/invariant expressions: \n- mhd_assert(NULL == daemon->master) is a runtime assertion (not a language-level controlling statement in the shown source) and the expression depends on daemon->master, so it is not invariant. Any expansion of the assert macro that introduces a control statement would be a macro implementation detail not visible here. \n- The #if defined(...) / #else / #endif are preprocessor conditionals evaluated at translation time, not C controlling expressions governed by MISRA C Rule 14.3. \n- The call MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex) is a normal function call, not a controlling expression. \n- The (void) daemon; statement merely suppresses unused-parameter warnings and is not a controlling expression. \nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
