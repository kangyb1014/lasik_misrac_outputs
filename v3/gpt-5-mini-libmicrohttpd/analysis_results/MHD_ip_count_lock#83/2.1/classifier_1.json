  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement mhd_assert(NULL == daemon->master); is executed when MHD_ip_count_lock is called and therefore is reachable. Even if the mhd_assert macro expands to a no-op in some builds, that is a compile-time removal, not an instance of unreachable code. A true Rule 2.1 violation would be code that can never be executed on any control-flow path (e.g. code after an unconditional return or an infinite loop), which is not the case here."
