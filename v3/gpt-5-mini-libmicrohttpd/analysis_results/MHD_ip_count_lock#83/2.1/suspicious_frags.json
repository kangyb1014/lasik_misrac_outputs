  "explanation": "The only potential unreachable-code issues in this function arise from the assertion and the compile-time conditional branches. The mhd_assert line may abort at runtime (making subsequent code on that execution path unreachable) or be defined away in some build configurations. The #if/#else block produces mutually exclusive compiled code depending on preprocessor symbols; depending on build configuration one branch will not be present in the translation unit and should be checked to ensure no unreachable code is introduced in the chosen configuration. There are no other statements or control-flow constructs in this function that could produce unreachable code, so no other fragments require investigation."
