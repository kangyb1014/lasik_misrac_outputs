  "explanation": "I flagged the macro-based declaration (_MHD_EXTERN) and the preprocessor-controlled FD_SETSIZE selection because macros commonly hide compiler-specific attributes or calling-convention/storage-class extensions (for example __attribute__, __declspec, __stdcall, visibility attributes, etc.). Those macro expansions are the only places in this snippet that could legitimately introduce documented compiler extensions; their definitions must be inspected to determine compliance with MISRA C Rule 1.2.\n\nAll other code in the fragment uses standard C constructs: enum return type, function definition syntax, standard pointer and struct usage, fd_set type, conditional (?:) operator, casts to unsigned int, and ordinary preprocessor conditionals \u2014 none of these are compiler language extensions as shown. There are no explicit extension tokens visible (for example __attribute__, __declspec, inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions, labels-as-values, or other known compiler-specific keywords). Therefore no other parts of the snippet need investigation for Rule 1.2."
