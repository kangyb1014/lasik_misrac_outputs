  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_run_from_select:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_run_from_select (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                     const fd_set *read_fd_set,\n                     const fd_set *write_fd_set,\n                     const fd_set *except_fd_set)\n{\n  return MHD_run_from_select2 (daemon,\n                               read_fd_set,\n                               write_fd_set,\n                               except_fd_set,\n#ifdef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n                               daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ?\n                               ((unsigned int) daemon->fdset_size) :\n                               ((unsigned int) _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE)\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The preprocessor conditional simply selects which expression is compiled; when HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined the runtime conditional (?:) chooses between two values based on daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app, so removing either alternative would change behaviour. When the macro is not defined only the default value is compiled \u2014 code excluded by the preprocessor is not dead code. There is no executed operation here whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated. (Note: if elsewhere in the project daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app were provably constant such that one arm could never be taken, that would be a separate potential violation detectable by whole-project analysis.)"
