True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code casts the incoming void *cls to a non-const pointer: struct handler_param *param = (struct handler_param *) cls; param is only used for read-only access (e.g. param->response_page is passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible. Here the pointer can and should be declared const (e.g. const struct handler_param *param = cls), so the current fragment violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the function the incoming void *cls is cast to struct handler_param *param even though the code only performs read-only accesses (param->response_page is used but never modified). MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible; here the local pointer can and should be const-qualified. A simple fix is to declare the local pointer as const, e.g.:\n\nconst struct handler_param *param = (const struct handler_param *) cls;\n\n(or in C: const struct handler_param *param = cls;)\n\nThe function signature likely cannot be changed because cls comes from the framework, but making the local pointer const eliminates the violation. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is correct."
