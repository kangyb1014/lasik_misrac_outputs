The remaining code does not call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not need to be investigated for this specific rule: variable declarations, (void) casts to silence warnings, the &aptr / *req_cls pointer logic, assignment and destruction of the MHD_Response, calls to MHD_queue_response / MHD_destroy_response, and the return statements do not themselves involve <string.h> functions or string buffer bounds issues relevant to Rule 21.17."
