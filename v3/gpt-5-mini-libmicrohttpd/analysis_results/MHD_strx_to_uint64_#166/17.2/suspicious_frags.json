  "explanation": "The only function invocation(s) in this routine are the calls to toxdigitvalue; there are no other function calls, function-pointer usages, or macros that expand to calls within this function. The function does not call MHD_strx_to_uint64_ anywhere in its body, and there is no indirect call mechanism present here, so arithmetic operations, pointer increments, comparisons, assignments, return statements and use of integer macros/constants (e.g. UINT64_MAX) do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. To fully assess possible indirect recursion, reviewers should inspect the implementation(s) of toxdigitvalue to confirm it does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_strx_to_uint64_."
