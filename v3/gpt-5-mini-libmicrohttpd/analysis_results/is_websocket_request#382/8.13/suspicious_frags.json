  "explanation": "Only the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *con' is a pointer that is not const-qualified and therefore should be investigated for Rule 8.13. The other pointer parameters (upg_header and con_header) are already const-qualified. The string literals (WS_UPGRADE_VALUE and \"Upgrade\") are inherently constant and are passed to functions that accept const char *; strstr/strcmp usage does not require modifying their inputs here. No other pointer declarations appear in the fragment, and the (void) con line only suppresses an unused-parameter warning for that (potentially) const-qualified pointer."
