  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2. The function body contains no call to itself (direct recursion) nor any calls to other user-defined functions that could form an indirect recursive cycle. The only function calls are to standard library functions strcmp and strstr, which do not call back into user code. There are no function-pointer invocations, callbacks, or macro expansions in the shown code that would imply an indirect self-call. The (void) con; statement and use of macros/constants (WS_UPGRADE_VALUE, MHD_YES, MHD_NO) do not introduce recursion. Therefore there are no suspect fragments in this function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
