The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of is_websocket_request.\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nis_websocket_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, const char *upg_header,\n                      const char *con_header)\n{\n\n  (void) con;  /* Unused.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function body contains the statement \"(void) con;\" to silence an unused-parameter warning. That expression is a no-op whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Additionally, if the entire function is never called anywhere in the project it would also be dead code, but that cannot be determined from the fragment alone.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \"(void) con;\" is the common, deliberate idiom to mark a parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although it performs no observable side-effect and its removal would not change program semantics in the normal sense, MISRA\u2019s intent for Rule 2.2 is to forbid genuinely redundant operational code that should be removed, not this explicit annotation of an unused parameter. In practice this idiom is used to document intent and avoid other diagnostics, and is not treated as a rule-2.2 violation. (Also, whether the entire function is never called cannot be determined from the fragment.)"
