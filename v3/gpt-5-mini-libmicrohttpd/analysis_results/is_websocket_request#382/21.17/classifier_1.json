  "scenario": "The code only checks upg_header != NULL but uses strcmp(upg_header, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE). If upg_header does not point to a null-terminated character array (for example it points into an HTTP header buffer that is not NUL-terminated or whose valid length is bounded and not terminated), strcmp will read past the object bounds searching for a '\\0', causing out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior. (WS_UPGRADE_VALUE as a string literal is safe, but the caller-supplied upg_header may be unsafe.)"
