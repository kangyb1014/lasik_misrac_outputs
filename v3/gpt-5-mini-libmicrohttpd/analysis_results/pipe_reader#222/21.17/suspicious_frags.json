  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The provided function contains no calls to any of those standard string-handling functions \u2014 it only calls read() and performs integer limit checks and casts on the size argument. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that fall under Rule 21.17 and need investigation for out-of-bounds accesses related to string.h usage. (Note: while buffer-size correctness for the read() call could be a separate safety concern, it is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and so is not reported here.)"
