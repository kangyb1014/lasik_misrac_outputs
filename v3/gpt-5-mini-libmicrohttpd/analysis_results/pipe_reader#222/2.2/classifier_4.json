Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of pipe_reader:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\npipe_reader (void *cls,\n             uint64_t pos,\n             char *buf,\n             size_t max)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response = cls;\n  ssize_t n;\n\n  (void) pos;\n\n#ifndef _WIN32\n  if (SSIZE_MAX < max)\n    max = SSIZE_MAX;\n  n = read (response->fd,\n            buf,\n            (MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_) max);\n#else  /* _WIN32 */\n  if (UINT_MAX < max)\n    max = INT_MAX;\n  n = read (response->fd,\n            buf,\n            (unsigned int) max);\n#endif /* _WIN32 */\n\n  if (0 == n)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;\n  if (n < 0)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  return n;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct MHD_Response *response = cls;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
