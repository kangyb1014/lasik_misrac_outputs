  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function writes to members of the object pointed to by the parameter (ctx->H[...] and ctx->count). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g., reassigning ctx or performing pointer arithmetic on it). The code contains no assignment to ctx, no pointer arithmetic, and no other modification of the parameter variable, so there are no fragments that need investigation under Rule 17.8."
