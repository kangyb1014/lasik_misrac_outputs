  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for Rule 21.17: the fragment does not call any functions from <string.h>, so the specific Rule 21.17 (bounds checks for string.h calls) is not applicable. Note: the expression param_name[1] can still produce an out-of-bounds access (and thus UB) if param_name is NULL or points to a string shorter than 2 characters (for example \"\"), but that is a different safety issue, not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
