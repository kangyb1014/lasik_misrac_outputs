  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant constants. The if expressions (if (0 != tool_params.threads) and if (tool_params.thread_per_conn)) depend on members of the tool_params object (runtime state) and are not compile-time invariants. The conditional operator ('-' == param_name[1] ? ...) depends on the function parameter param_name and thus is not an invariant controlling expression. The assignment tool_params.all_cpus = ! 0; uses the constant expression '! 0', but this is not a controlling expression and therefore not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no do/while or loop constructs with constant controls nor any obvious intentional infinite-loop idioms that would fall under the allowed exceptions. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for Rule 14.3."
