First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The function setup_epoll_fd contains no for statements, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops) is not directly applicable to the visible code. The remaining statements are assignments, conditional checks, function/macro invocations and preprocessor conditionals that do not themselves introduce for loops in this translation unit. The only potential source of hidden for statements would be in the expansion/definitions of the invoked macros/functions (which are not provided here); therefore the macro/function invocations listed above were included so their definitions can be inspected for any for loops that might violate Rule 14.2. All other lines (epoll_create/epoll_create1 calls, variable declaration/assignment, if/return statements, and preprocessor guards) do not contain or introduce for statements and thus do not need investigation for this specific rule."
