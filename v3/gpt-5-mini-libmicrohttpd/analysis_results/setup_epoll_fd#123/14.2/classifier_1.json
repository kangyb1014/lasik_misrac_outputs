  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of setup_epoll_fd:\n```c\nstatic int\nsetup_epoll_fd (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  int fd;\n\n#ifndef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  (void) daemon; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n#endif /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a function call used in an if statement, not inside a for statement \u2014 so Rule 14.2 (well\u2011formed for loops) is not applicable and not violated. A concrete violation scenario would be if this call were used in a for clause with side effects, e.g. for (...; MHD_socket_noninheritable_(fd); ...) where MHD_socket_noninheritable_ modifies persistent state (the epoll FD or other objects modified in the loop body). That would breach clause 2 (second clause must have no persistent side effects). Similarly, using the call in the third clause when it modifies objects other than the loop counter would breach clause 3."
