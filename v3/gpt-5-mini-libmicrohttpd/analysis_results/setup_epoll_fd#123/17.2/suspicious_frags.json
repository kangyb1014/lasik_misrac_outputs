  "explanation": "No direct call to setup_epoll_fd appears in this function. The remaining code fragments consist of declarations, control-flow structures, preprocessor conditionals, simple casts (\"(void) daemon;\"), comparisons against the macro MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, and return statements; these constructs do not by themselves introduce recursion and therefore do not need further investigation. The listed fragments are the function calls or macro expansions present in the function body that could, in principle, call back into application code (and thereby cause indirect recursion) and thus should be inspected by other agents for possible indirect or indirect recursion paths."
