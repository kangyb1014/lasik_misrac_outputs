  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The elements present are standard C or OS/library APIs and project-specific identifiers, not compiler extensions: \n\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif) are standard C preprocessor features, not compiler extensions.\n- The (void) daemon; cast to suppress unused-parameter warnings is standard C practice.\n- Calls to epoll_create1 and epoll_create and the EPOLL_CLOEXEC macro are OS/library interfaces (Linux epoll API), not compiler language extensions. Their availability is controlled by feature-test macros and build configuration, but they are not compiler language extensions.\n- Macros and functions with the MHD_ prefix (MHD_DLOG, MHD_socket_last_strerr_, MHD_socket_noninheritable_, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET) are project-specific symbols, not compiler extensions.\n- The _(...) macro commonly used for localization (gettext) is a macro, not a compiler extension.\n\nI also checked for typical compiler-specific language extensions that must be reported (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, inline assembler, compiler-specific calling conventions, or nonstandard keywords). None of these appear in the code fragment. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
