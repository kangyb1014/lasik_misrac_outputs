  "explanation": "I did not include any of the const-qualified pointer parameters (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) because they are already const-qualified and therefore conform to Rule 8.13. Calls that pass these const pointers to library functions (strlen, memcmp, reply/handle functions) are not flagged here because the local use is with const-qualified types; any mismatch would be in the callee declarations, which are outside this fragment. The declaration of struct MHD_Connection *connection is not flagged because that API object is likely intended to be mutable by the request/response helpers (so a non-const pointer is appropriate). The static int already_called_marker itself is an object (not a pointer) so it is not directly relevant to Rule 8.13, though its address is used in the flagged fragments above."
