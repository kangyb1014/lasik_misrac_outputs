  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function calls string.h routines (strcmp(url, \"/\"), strlen(url), memcmp(url, \u2026)) on the pointer url without validating it or otherwise establishing the precondition that url is non-NULL and NUL-terminated. If a caller were to pass a NULL pointer or a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffer, these calls can dereference NULL or read past the bounds of the buffer, which is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids. \n\nNote: If the surrounding API (the HTTP library) formally guarantees that url is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, then the code can be compliant; but that guarantee must be explicit/documented or enforced. Absent such a guarantee, the code should validate url (e.g. check for NULL) or otherwise ensure safe bounded access to satisfy Rule 21.17."
