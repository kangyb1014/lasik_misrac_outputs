True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe expression statement '(void) upload_size;' evaluates the parameter and discards the result but performs no observable action. Removing this statement would not change program behaviour (it is only present to suppress an unused-parameter warning), so it is an executed no-op and therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Exception: if 'upload_size' were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, then it would not be dead; that is not the case here.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent is correct. The statement \u2018\u2018(void) upload_size;\u2019\u2019 evaluates an expression that has no side effects and contributes nothing to program behaviour; removing it would not change the observable behaviour of the program. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code, so this cast-to-void is dead code. (If the parameter were volatile or its evaluation had side effects the situation would differ, but that is not the case here.) To comply, eliminate the no-op (or omit the parameter identifier in the function definition or use an approved mechanism for indicating intentionally unused parameters.)"
