  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The expression statement '(void) upload_size;' evaluates the parameter and discards the result but performs no observable action. Removing this statement would not change program behaviour (it is only present to suppress an unused-parameter warning), so it is an executed no-op and therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Exception: if 'upload_size' were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, then it would not be dead; that is not the case here.)"
