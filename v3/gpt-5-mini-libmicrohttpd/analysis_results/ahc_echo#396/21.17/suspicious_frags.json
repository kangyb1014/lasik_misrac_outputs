  "explanation": "The provided code fragment contains no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Therefore there are no explicit uses in this snippet that immediately violate the rule. The items reported above are locations that should be investigated further because they pass buffers or strings to other modules or allocate buffers that may later be used by callbacks (e.g. read_cb/free_cb) or library routines which are not shown here; those external routines might call string.h functions and could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. Other lines in the function (error handling, deflateInit/deflateEnd, fclose, free, MHD_queue_response, and simple pointer assignments) do not themselves use <string.h> functions nor expose buffer/length relationships that would suggest a potential Rule 21.17 violation within this fragment, so they do not need investigation for this specific rule based on the code shown."
