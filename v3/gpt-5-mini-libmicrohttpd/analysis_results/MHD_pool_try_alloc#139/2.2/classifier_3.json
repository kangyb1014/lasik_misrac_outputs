Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_try_alloc:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_try_alloc (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                    size_t size,\n                    size_t *required_bytes)\n{\n  void *ret;\n  size_t asize;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n  if ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n  { /* size is too close to SIZE_MAX, very unlikely */\n    *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n  {\n    mhd_assert ((pool->end - pool->pos) == \\\n                ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->end - pool->pos));\n    if (asize <= pool->end)\n      *required_bytes = asize - (pool->end - pool->pos);\n    else\n      *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  *required_bytes = 0;\n  ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize];\n  pool->end -= asize;\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (ret, size);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nasize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(size) is used in subsequent conditional checks and computations (the zero-check, comparison against available pool space, computing required_bytes, and adjusting pool->end). Removing this assignment would change program behavior, so it is not dead code."
