Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_try_alloc:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_try_alloc (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                    size_t size,\n                    size_t *required_bytes)\n{\n  void *ret;\n  size_t asize;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n  if ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n  { /* size is too close to SIZE_MAX, very unlikely */\n    *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n  {\n    mhd_assert ((pool->end - pool->pos) == \\\n                ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->end - pool->pos));\n    if (asize <= pool->end)\n      *required_bytes = asize - (pool->end - pool->pos);\n    else\n      *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  *required_bytes = 0;\n  ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize];\n  pool->end -= asize;\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (ret, size);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n  { /* size is too close to SIZE_MAX, very unlikely */\n    *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The branch defends against wrap-around of ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(size): if size is non-zero but the rounded/augmented size overflows size_t and becomes 0 (e.g. size is near SIZE_MAX so the rounding/addition wraps to 0), the code sets *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX and returns NULL. That behavior would change if the branch were removed, so this code is not dead code (it is a defensive, potentially reachable overflow case)."
