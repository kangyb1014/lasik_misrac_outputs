  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function body. The code only contains standard C constructs (pointer arithmetic, size_t, macros, standard conditional/return statements, standard preprocessor line continuation using '\\'). There are no occurrences of well-known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC), statement-expressions ({ ... }) , nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords that compilers document as extensions. Note: some identifiers here are macros or functions (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) whose definitions are not shown; if their definitions (elsewhere) use compiler extensions, those definitions should be inspected separately. Based solely on the code shown, no fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
