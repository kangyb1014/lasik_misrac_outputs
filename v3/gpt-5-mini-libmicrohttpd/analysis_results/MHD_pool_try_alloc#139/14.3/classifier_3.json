  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) ) depends on the runtime value of \u2018size\u2019 (asize is computed from size), so it is not invariant. A violation would occur only if asize were a compile\u2011time constant (making the condition always true or always false), which is not the case here."
