  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could reasonably be made to point to const-qualified targets. Specifically:\n- The function modifies the MemoryPool object (e.g. pool->end -= asize;) so the 'pool' parameter cannot be made a pointer-to-const.\n- The code writes to *required_bytes in multiple places, so the pointed-to size_t must be mutable (cannot be const-qualified).\n- The allocation arithmetic and checks (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, asize calculations, mhd_assert checks, comparisons with SIZE_MAX, and the early-return logic) do not declare or yield pointers that could be made const-qualified; they are scalar computations or assertions.\n- The returned pointer refers to memory provided to the caller (an allocator-like API) and is intentionally returned as a mutable void* for the caller to use; internal adjustments to pool->end and the red-zone/poisoning logic are part of allocation semantics rather than missed const qualification.\nGiven the above, the only locations that merit investigation for possible const-qualification are the pointer declarations/uses listed in suspicious_frags."
