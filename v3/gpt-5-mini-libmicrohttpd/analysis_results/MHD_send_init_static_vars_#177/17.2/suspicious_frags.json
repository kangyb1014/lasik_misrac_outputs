  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 17.2 concern is recursion (direct or indirect). The only function body present is MHD_send_init_static_vars_, and the only function calls inside it are freebsd_sendfile_init_() and iov_max_init_(). These calls are potentially part of an indirect recursion chain and therefore should be investigated. Other parts of the snippet (preprocessor directives #ifdef/#endif, comments, and the surrounding conditional compilation blocks) cannot themselves introduce calls and are not relevant for detecting recursion, so they do not need investigation. No other function calls or definitions appear in this code that would warrant further inspection for Rule 17.2."
