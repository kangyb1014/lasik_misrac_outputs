Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_init_static_vars_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If the code is built with none of the feature macros defined (HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE not defined, or SF_FLAGS not defined, and either HAVE_SYSCONF or _SC_IOV_MAX not defined so the second block is inactive), MHD_send_init_static_vars_ has no executable statements. Any calls to this function would execute but perform no action, so removing those calls would not change program behaviour (aside from timing). In that configuration the calls are dead code and thus Rule 2.2 is violated."
