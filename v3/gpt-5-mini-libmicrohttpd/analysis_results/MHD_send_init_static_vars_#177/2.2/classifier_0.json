  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_init_static_vars_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call is conditionally compiled (#ifdef SF_FLAGS) and, when present, presumably performs platform-specific initialization. There is no evidence here that the call is executed yet has no effect, so you cannot conclude it is dead code. Violation scenario (if you need one): if SF_FLAGS is defined in the build but freebsd_sendfile_init_() is implemented as an empty function or performs only computations with no observable side effects, then the call would be executable but removable without changing program behaviour \u2014 that would violate Rule 2.2."
