Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_init_static_vars_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to iov_max_init_() is conditionally compiled and executed only when HAVE_SYSCONF and _SC_IOV_MAX are defined. In a normal build for a platform that provides _SC_IOV_MAX this call performs runtime initialization (e.g. querying sysconf and storing an iov_max value) and thus affects program behaviour; removing it would change behaviour, so it is not dead code. (A violation scenario would exist if iov_max_init_() is an empty/no\u2011op function or its effects are never used \u2014 in that specific case the call would be dead code.)"
