  "explanation": "The only potentially unreachable executable statements in this function are the platform-conditional initialization calls guarded by preprocessor macros; those are included above for investigation. Other parts of the snippet (function signature, opening/closing braces and comments) are not executable statements that could be \u2018\u2018unreachable\u2019\u2019 at runtime, and there are no control-flow constructs (returns, goto, conditional/loop bodies, or code following unconditional returns) elsewhere in the function that could create unreachable code. Therefore no additional fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
