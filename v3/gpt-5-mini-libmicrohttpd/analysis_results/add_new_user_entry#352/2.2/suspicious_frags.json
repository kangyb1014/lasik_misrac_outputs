  "explanation": "I have flagged the individual assignments, the series of digest/hash function calls (and their conditional updates of 'res'), the failure return and the final state updates/return as suspicious fragments to be investigated for possible dead code or redundant operations. The remaining code fragments are not flagged because they are evidently required for correct behaviour and are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2: - The function signature and local variable declarations are necessary and not executable operations that could be removed. - The bounds check: if ((sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])) <= user_ids_used) return 0; prevents overflow and affects control flow, so it is not dead. - The computation of the new entry pointer (entry = user_ids + user_ids_used;) is used subsequently to store data and is therefore active. - Comments and formatting lines have no executable effect. - There is no obviously unreachable code in the function (no code after an unconditional return or a condition that is always true/false visible in this snippet). These unflagged fragments therefore do not meet the definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour) and so do not require investigation for Rule 2.2 based on the provided snippet."
