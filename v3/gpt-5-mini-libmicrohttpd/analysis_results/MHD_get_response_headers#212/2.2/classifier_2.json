  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_headers:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_response_headers (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                          MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator,\n                          void *iterator_cls)\n{\n  int numHeaders = 0;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    numHeaders++;\n    if ((NULL != iterator) &&\n        (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                             pos->kind,\n                             pos->header,\n                             pos->value)))\n      break;\n  }\n  return numHeaders;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ((NULL != iterator) &&\n        (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                             pos->kind,\n                             pos->header,\n                             pos->value)))\n      break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The conditional and the iterator() call influence control flow (they can cause the loop to break) and may have side effects; removing them would change program behaviour unless it can be proven across the entire project that iterator is never non-NULL or that iterator() is always called and always returns a constant and has no side effects. A violation would only occur in a specific project-wide situation where iterator is statically provable to be irrelevant (e.g. always NULL or the call has no effects and always returns the same value that never triggers the break), making the call and comparison removable without changing behaviour."
