  "explanation": "Only the code fragments that involve the callback function pointer are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (prohibiting direct or indirect self-calls). The function signature shows that a function-pointer parameter (MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator) is passed in, and the if-statement contains an invocation of that callback. That callback could potentially call MHD_get_response_headers (directly or indirectly), producing recursion, so these fragments must be investigated. Other parts of the function (the for-loop header iterating pos = response->first_header; numHeaders++; the break/return statements; accesses to pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value) do not perform function calls themselves and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect self-calls; they do not need investigation with respect to Rule 17.2."
