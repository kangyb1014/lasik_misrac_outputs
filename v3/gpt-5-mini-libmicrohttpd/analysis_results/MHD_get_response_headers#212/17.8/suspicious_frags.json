  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: response (struct MHD_Response *), iterator (function pointer), and iterator_cls (void *). Examining the code: response is only dereferenced to read response->first_header and its fields; there is no assignment to response itself. iterator is only compared against NULL and invoked; it is never assigned or otherwise modified. iterator_cls is only passed as an argument to the iterator call; it is not assigned to or changed. The local variable pos is the only pointer that is assigned and advanced (pos = response->first_header; pos = pos->next) \u2014 pos is local, not a parameter. There are no lvalue uses, pointer arithmetic, or assignments targeting any of the parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to report."
