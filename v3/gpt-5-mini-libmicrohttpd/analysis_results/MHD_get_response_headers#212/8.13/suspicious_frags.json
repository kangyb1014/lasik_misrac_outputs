Other parts of the function (numHeaders variable, the NULL checks, the loop control, the increment of numHeaders, the break, the return statement, and the use of MHD_NO) do not involve pointer type definitions or pointer-to-object passing that would be affected by Rule 8.13, so they need not be investigated for this specific rule."
