  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is speculative and cannot be established from the provided code alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (\u201ca pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d) applies to the declarations of pointer types. The snippet shown only uses pos->header and pos->value in a read-only way (they are passed to an iterator), but the report does not show the declaration of struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header nor the prototype of MHD_KeyValueIterator. A violation exists only if (1) the struct fields are declared as non-const (e.g. char *header) and (2) they are never modified anywhere (so they could have been declared const). Without inspecting the struct definition and all uses, you cannot conclude that Rule 8.13 is violated. It\u2019s entirely possible the fields are intentionally mutable or required by the API (or the iterator expects non-const). To determine a true violation, inspect the declaration of MHD_HTTP_Res_Header and all code that writes to those fields; if they are never modified and intended read-only, change their types (and the iterator prototype if needed) to const-qualified pointers to satisfy MISRA 8.13."
