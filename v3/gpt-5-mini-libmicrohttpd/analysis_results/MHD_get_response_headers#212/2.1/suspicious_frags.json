  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were found in this function. Analysis:\n- Declarations (int numHeaders; struct ... *pos;) are executed on function entry and are reachable.\n- The for loop header (for (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)) may iterate zero or more times depending on runtime data; its body is therefore not statically unreachable.\n- The increment (numHeaders++) is executed whenever the loop body is entered; not unreachable.\n- The iterator call is guarded by a NULL check ((NULL != iterator) && ...), so the call site is reachable when iterator is non-NULL and not executed otherwise; there is no unreachable call due to short-circuiting.\n- The break inside the if is reachable when the iterator returns MHD_NO; it does not create unreachable code elsewhere in the function.\n- The final return is reachable on all control paths of the function; there is no code following the return that would be unreachable.\n- There are no labels, gotos, conditional compilation branches, or other constructs in this snippet that would create statically unreachable code.\n\nNote: Potential runtime issues (e.g., response being NULL leading to undefined dereference) are not examples of unreachable code and should be considered under other MISRA rules, but do not indicate violations of Rule 2.1 in this snippet."
