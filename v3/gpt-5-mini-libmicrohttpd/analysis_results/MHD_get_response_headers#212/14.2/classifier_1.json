  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_headers:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_response_headers (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                          MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator,\n                          void *iterator_cls)\n{\n  int numHeaders = 0;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    numHeaders++;\n    if ((NULL != iterator) &&\n        (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                             pos->kind,\n                             pos->header,\n                             pos->value)))\n      break;\n  }\n  return numHeaders;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ((NULL != iterator) &&\n        (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                             pos->kind,\n                             pos->header,\n                             pos->value)))\n      break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop has a single loop counter (pos) initialized in the first clause, the second clause uses only pos (NULL != pos) and has no persistent side effects, and the third clause modifies only the loop counter (pos = pos->next). The if-body calls the iterator but does not modify the loop counter in this code fragment. (Hypothetical violation would occur if the iterator callback or other called code modified pos or the object(s) accessed by the second/third clauses \u2014 e.g. modified pos or pos->next \u2014 because functions called inside the loop body are considered part of the loop behaviour.)"
