First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-statements are present in the provided function. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops and the three/ four clauses and loop-counter/flag constraints described. The only loop in this code is a while (length-- && ! context->corrupted) which is not a for statement, therefore there are no for-loop fragments to investigate for Rule 14.2 compliance.\n\nNotes on other constructs (not investigated because they are outside Rule 14.2 scope):\n- The while condition uses the post-decrement operator (length--) which has a side effect in the loop condition; this could be relevant to other MISRA rules about side effects in expressions but is not a for-loop Rule 14.2 issue.\n- The loop body modifies multiple objects (context->message_block_index, context->length_low/high, context->corrupted, message_array pointer). If these were part of a for-statement\u2019s clauses they might violate Rule 14.2, but they occur in a while loop and thus are outside the specific Rule 14.2 requirement.\n\nBecause Rule 14.2 targets the structure and clauses of for loops and there are none here, no code fragments need to be reported for investigation under that rule."
