Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the function implements the SHA-1 input processing flow (NULL checks, state checks, the main while loop, pointer increment message_array++, the SHA1ProcessMessageBlock call and the final return). These operations are required for correct streaming/length handling, error reporting and for invoking the block processing routine; removing them would clearly change behaviour. No other lines appear to be plainly redundant or removable without affecting functionality aside from the fragments listed above, so they are not listed for investigation."
