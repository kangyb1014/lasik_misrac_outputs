  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp (or other standard string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) are present in the provided code. The function operates on a byte buffer using an explicit length parameter (unsigned length) and pointer arithmetic; it does not attempt to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any fragment shown. Note: the call to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(context) is to an external routine whose implementation is not provided here; if checking the entire codebase, that routine should be inspected separately for uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings, but there are no such uses in the provided fragment."
