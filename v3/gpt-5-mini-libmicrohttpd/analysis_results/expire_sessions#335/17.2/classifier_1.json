  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code fragment calls the standard library function time(), not expire_sessions, so there is no direct or indirect self-call (recursion). This would only violate Rule 17.2 if the identifier time resolved to a user-defined function that (directly or indirectly) called expire_sessions, which is not the case in the shown code."
