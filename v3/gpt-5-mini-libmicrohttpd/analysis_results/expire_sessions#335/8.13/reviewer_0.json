According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type, e.g. 'const struct Session *next;'. Thus the current declaration violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 asks that pointers be to const-qualified types when it is possible to do so. In this function the local 'next' pointer is not merely used for read-only inspection: its value is assigned into non-const storage (sessions and prev->next) and is later assigned to 'pos' (which is subsequently freed). Declaring 'next' as const struct Session * would make those assignments invalid (it would require discarding const qualification or adding casts). Similarly 'pos' cannot be const because the object it points to is freed. Because the pointer value must be stored in non-const pointer objects and used in operations that require non-const pointers, it is not possible to const-qualify 'next' here, so there is no violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
