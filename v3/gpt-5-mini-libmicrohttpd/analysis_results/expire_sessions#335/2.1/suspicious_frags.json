  "explanation": "The only code fragment in this function that can be statically unreachable (per translation-unit level analysis) is the entire static function itself if it is never referenced in the project (static gives internal linkage). Within the function body there are no obviously unreachable statements: there is no unconditional return, no sequence of statements after an unconditional jump, no mutually exclusive preprocessor condition that removes code, and the while/if constructs are runtime-dependent (their branches may or may not execute depending on data but are not provably unreachable from the code alone). Therefore no other inner statements or branches need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided snippet."
