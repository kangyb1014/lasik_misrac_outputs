Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__poll:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__poll (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.epoll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-e' or '--epoll'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.select)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-s' or '--select'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.poll = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The ternary expression returns one of two enum values based on param_name[1]. This value is used as the function's return and therefore affects program behaviour; removing it would change the return value and thus the program. Consequently this fragment is not dead code. (Note: ensure param_name has at least two characters to avoid out-of-bounds access, but that is a safety/UB concern, not dead code.)"
