  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The three fragments listed are the only controlling expressions in this function (two if conditions and the conditional (?:) operator). Other lines in the function do not introduce control-flow conditions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3: fprintf calls are ordinary function calls, the assignment \"tool_params.poll = ! 0;\" is a simple assignment (not a controlling expression), the function signature/return type and braces are not control expressions, and there are no loops in the function. Consequently, no other fragments need investigation for invariance of controlling expressions."
