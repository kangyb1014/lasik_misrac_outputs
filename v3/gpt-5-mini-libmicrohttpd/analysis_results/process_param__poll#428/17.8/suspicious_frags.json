  "explanation": "No fragments modify the function parameter param_name or the pointer itself. The code only reads from param_name (fprintf uses it and the expression param_name[1] inspects a character). There is no assignment to param_name, no increment/decrement or pointer arithmetic that would alter the pointer, and no call passing the address of param_name that could allow modification. Additionally, param_name is declared as const char *, so the pointed-to object is not modified either. Other statements (checks of tool_params and assignment tool_params.poll = !0) do not involve the function parameter and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
