  "explanation": "I examined the entire function. It uses only standard C constructs: a static function returning a user-defined enum type, standard if statements, calls to fprintf from the C library, assignment to a struct/variable member, the logical-not operator (! 0) which yields 0 or 1 per the C standard, and the conditional (?:) operator with a character literal comparison. There are no compiler-specific extensions present (no asm statements, no __attribute__ or pragma extensions, no typeof, no statement expressions, no GCC/Clang builtin extensions, no inline assembly, no variable-length array extensions, no _Generic or other vendor-only features beyond standard C). Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
