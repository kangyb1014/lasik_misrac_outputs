  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string comparison functions appears in the provided fragment. The code only: checks for NULL, casts the void* data to a struct pointer, calls MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ with param->name, copies param fields (arg and start_routine) and frees data, then calls the thread start routine. None of these statements invoke memcmp or perform comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
