  "scenario": "The declaration itself does not violate Rule 17.2. However, in this function thr_func is later assigned from param->start_routine and called. If param->start_routine were set to named_thread_starter, then thr_func(arg) would call named_thread_starter indirectly (named_thread_starter -> thr_func -> named_thread_starter), creating an indirect recursive call and thus violating Rule 17.2."
