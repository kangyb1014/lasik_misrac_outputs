  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the provided function contains no pointer types or pointer operations. Specifically: the function signature returns an enum (not a pointer) and has no parameters; the body tests scalar flags (force_md5, force_sha256, force_sha512_256) and returns enum constants. There are no pointer declarations, pointer parameters, pointer returns, pointer arithmetic, or pointer casts in the snippet. Therefore Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) is not applicable to any fragment shown."
