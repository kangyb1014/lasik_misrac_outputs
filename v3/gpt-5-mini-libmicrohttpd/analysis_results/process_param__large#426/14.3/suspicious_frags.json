  "explanation": "The selected fragments are the only controlling expressions in this function (the three if statements and the conditional (?:) expression). Other parts of the function do not constitute controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: - The fprintf(...) calls are just function calls (not controlling expressions). - The assignments and return statements (e.g. tool_params.large = ! 0; and the earlier 'return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;') are not controlling expressions. - There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in this function that would create additional controlling expressions. - The use of the constant expression '! 0' is an assignment operand, not a controlling expression, so Rule 14.3 does not apply to it here. Therefore no other code fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
