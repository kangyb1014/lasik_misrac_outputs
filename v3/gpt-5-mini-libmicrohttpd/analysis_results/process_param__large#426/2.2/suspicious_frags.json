Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the listed code fragments are flagged for investigation with respect to possible dead code. The remaining text in the function is structural (the function signature and enclosing braces) and does not contain executed operations that could constitute dead code. All executable statements in the function have been included above: the three conditional blocks that print an error and return, the assignment that sets the large flag, and the final return that selects the return value based on param_name[1]. No other distinct executable statements exist in the provided snippet that could be candidates for dead code."
