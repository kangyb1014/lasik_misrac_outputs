  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The only operations on strings/characters are fprintf (printing param_name) and a single-character comparison ('-' == param_name[1]). Rule 21.14 specifically concerns using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; since memcmp is not used anywhere in this fragment, there are no code fragments to investigate for this rule. (Note: other potential issues such as bounds or null-pointer checks on param_name are unrelated to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and thus were not flagged.)"
