  "explanation": "I selected the function declaration and every conditional block that contains an immediate return, the assignment to tool_params.large, and the final return with the ternary operator. These are the only locations in this snippet that can introduce unreachable code paths (returns that may make later statements unreachable, a possibly redundant assignment, or a return whose branches should be verified). Other parts of the snippet (string literals, braces, whitespace, the fprintf calls' internals, and the overall function closing brace) do not themselves constitute unreachable code and therefore do not need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1. No other return statements or code lines in this function could be unreachable beyond the fragments listed above."
