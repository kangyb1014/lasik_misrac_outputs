  "explanation": "The only uses of the parameter that could relate to out-of-bounds or invalid pointer access are the three fprintf calls that pass param_name as a %s argument and the explicit indexing param_name[1]. No <string.h> functions (memcpy, memset, strlen, strcpy, etc.) are called in this function, and there are no other pointer dereferences or buffer-manipulating operations elsewhere in the snippet. The remaining code (checks of tool_params flags, setting tool_params.large, and returning enum constants) does not involve string handling or pointer arithmetic and therefore does not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
