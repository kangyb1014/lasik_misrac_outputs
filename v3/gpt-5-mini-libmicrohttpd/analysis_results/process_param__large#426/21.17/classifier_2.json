  "scenario": "The code uses fprintf with the \"%s\" format specifier, not any function from <string.h>. Rule 21.17 only applies to the standard string.h functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen). Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: if param_name were not a null\u2011terminated string, the %s conversion could still read out of bounds \u2014 a different safety issue but not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A concrete 21.17 violation would be something like calling strcpy(dest, param_name) when dest is smaller than the length of param_name.)"
