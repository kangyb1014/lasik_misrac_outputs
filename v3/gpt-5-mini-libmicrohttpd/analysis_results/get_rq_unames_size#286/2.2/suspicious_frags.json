The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function need not be investigated for potential dead code because they directly affect the computed return value or are structural/required code: the function signature and local variable declaration are required; the arithmetic additions and the final \"return s;\" are necessary to produce the function result and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the nested conditional structure is used to select the correct size computation for different enum values (the selected conditional fragments cover those branches for investigation). The comment text is non-executable. No other standalone statements remain that could be considered executed yet redundant or removable without changing program behaviour."
