  "explanation": "No other lines in this function perform string handling or pointer-based memory copying, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Specifically:\n- The function signature and return statement only declare/return values and do not access buffers.\n- The mhd_assert call only checks a condition and does not perform any string manipulation or buffer access.\n- The initialisation s = 0 and the if/else branch structure are control flow and scalar operations only.\n- There are no direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) in this function.\nTherefore only the size-computation expressions listed above need investigation because they compute lengths that may be used with string functions elsewhere (risking underflow/overflow or incorrect size calculations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses)."
