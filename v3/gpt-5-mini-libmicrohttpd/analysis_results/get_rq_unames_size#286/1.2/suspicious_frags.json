  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The tokens and constructs used are standard C: the function uses a size_t return, an enum parameter, standard arithmetic and comparisons, if/else, and comments. The leading identifier _MHD_static_inline appears to be a macro name; macros themselves are not language extensions and the code does not show any known compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __inline__ or other vendor-specific keywords). Likewise, there are no GCC/Clang/MSVC specific pragmas or inline asm constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments that explicitly indicate use of documented compiler language extensions to report for Rule 1.2."
