  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp (or any direct string comparison using memcmp) appear in this function. The code only reads length fields (username.value.len and username_ext.value.len), performs integer arithmetic and comparisons of enum values, and returns a size_t. There are no character-buffer comparisons or uses of null-terminated string pointers here that would require memcmp. The two macros/functions called (mhd_assert and get_rq_uname_type) are not expanded here; within this fragment there is no evidence they perform memcmp-based null-terminated string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
