Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 here 'block' should be declared 'const void *block'.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace the parameter block is only inspected (checked for NULL and used as an argument to mp_ptr_diff_ and mp_ptr_le_), it is never used to modify the pointee. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so block should be declared const void *block. (As Agent A noted, if pool->memory is also never used to modify the pointee, the memory member could likewise be const-qualified, but that depends on the struct definition elsewhere.)"
