Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                               void *block,\n                               size_t block_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (block != NULL || block_size == 0);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_size);\n  if (NULL != block)\n  {\n    const size_t block_offset = mp_ptr_diff_ (block, pool->memory);\n    mhd_assert (mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, block));\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset);\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset + block_size);\n    return (pool->pos ==\n            ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (block_offset + block_size));\n  }\n  return false; /* Unallocated blocks cannot be resized in-place */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn false; /* Unallocated blocks cannot be resized in-place */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final `return false;` is executed when the caller passes block == NULL (the earlier if handles block != NULL). Removing it would change program behaviour (the function could fall off the end without returning a value -> undefined behaviour) and therefore it is not dead code. Note also that mhd_assert may be a no-op in production builds, so the NULL case is reachable and the return is required to provide a defined result."
