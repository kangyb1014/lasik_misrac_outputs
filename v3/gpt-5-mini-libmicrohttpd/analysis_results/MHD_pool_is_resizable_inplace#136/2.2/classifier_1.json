  "scenario": "Not necessarily. The statement is an assertion (mhd_assert) and by itself cannot be declared dead-code without knowing the definition of mhd_assert and whether the check is executed or has side\u2011effects. If mhd_assert is compiled out (e.g. expands to ((void)0)) the statement is not executed and therefore not \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 under Rule 2.2. If mhd_assert performs observable actions (logging, abort) its removal would change behaviour and so it is not dead. However, a concrete violation scenario exists: if mhd_assert expands to a runtime-evaluated check that has no side-effects and the condition is provably always true (or its execution never affects program behaviour), then that executed, effectless check would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
