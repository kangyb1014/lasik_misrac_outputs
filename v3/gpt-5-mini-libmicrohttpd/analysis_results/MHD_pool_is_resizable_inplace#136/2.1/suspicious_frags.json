  "explanation": "I selected the if (NULL != block) block and the final return false as primary suspicious fragments because they represent alternate control-flow paths that could be unreachable depending on caller assumptions, macro-expanded assertions, or invariants (e.g. if callers never pass NULL or if assertions are implemented to abort or remove branches). I also included the key mhd_assert lines that constrain block/block_size and pool state because they can affect reachability of the branches (they may be compiled out or implemented to terminate, which can make branches appear unreachable).\n\nOther parts of the function were not included because they are simple computations or single-statement expressions that do not themselves constitute unreachable code (for example, the mp_ptr_diff_ call and the ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE expression are used in the return value and are reachable whenever their containing branch is taken). There is no code after a return or other obvious syntactic dead code in this function beyond the fragments listed above, so no additional lines were flagged."
