  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for use of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), inline assembly, __declspec, GCC/Clang/MSC specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions). None of those appear in the source fragment. Specific checks and reasons:\n\n- No reserved compiler extension identifiers present: there are no tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __declspec, typeof, __inline, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- No GCC/Clang/MSC extensions: no statement expressions ({ ... }), no nested functions, no labels-as-values, no inline assembly, no use of __volatile__ or __thread, etc.\n- Use of backslash at end-of-line to split string literals and adjacent string literal concatenation are standard preprocessing/lexical features of C (not compiler extensions).\n- Use of bool/true/false and enum are standard C (C99 and later) features, not compiler extensions.\n- Function and identifier names that include underscores or the word \"static\" (e.g., MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static) are ordinary identifiers, not language extensions.\n- Macros and functions referenced (mhd_assert, MHD_pool_reset, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, etc.) could expand to implementation-specific code, but within this fragment there is no direct use of compiler-specific extension syntax. (Investigation of macro definitions would be required to be certain, but macros themselves are not evidence of use of a language extension in this fragment.)\n\nBecause the fragment does not contain any explicit compiler extension syntax as documented by compilers, there are no code fragments to report for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
