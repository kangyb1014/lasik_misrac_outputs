  "explanation": "I did not find any constructs in the provided function that are compiler-specific language extensions. The code uses standard C features only: pointer types, structs, enums, function calls, conditional compilation (#ifdef/#endif), and standard preprocessor line continuation (backslash) which is part of the C preprocessor. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC-specific keywords, Microsoft-specific extensions, inline assembler, or other non-standard identifiers. The boolean literals true/false may be macros (from stdbool.h or project headers) but are not language extensions themselves. Note: macros called in this fragment (e.g. mhd_assert, MHD_POOL_DESTROY, MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_) could expand to extension-using code elsewhere, but those expansions are not present in the shown code and therefore are outside the scope of this check. Based on the code shown, no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
