  "scenario": "The single call MHD_pool_destroy(connection->pool) in MHD_connection_close_ is not, by itself, a direct recursive call to MHD_connection_close_. There is no evidence in the provided fragment that MHD_pool_destroy calls MHD_connection_close_ (directly). Hence, based on the code shown, Rule 17.2 is not violated.\n\nHowever, an indirect-recursion scenario that would violate Rule 17.2 is possible if MHD_pool_destroy (or any function it calls) invokes MHD_connection_close_ (or another function that eventually calls MHD_connection_close_). For example, if the pool implementation runs registered destruction callbacks and one such callback calls MHD_connection_close_ (or triggers notify_completed which in turn leads to MHD_connection_close_), this would create an indirect self-call and therefore violate Rule 17.2. To confirm compliance, inspect the implementation of MHD_pool_destroy and any callbacks it invokes; alternatively, nulling connection->pool before calling MHD_pool_destroy or ensuring no callbacks re-enter MHD_connection_close_ would prevent the potential indirect recursion."
