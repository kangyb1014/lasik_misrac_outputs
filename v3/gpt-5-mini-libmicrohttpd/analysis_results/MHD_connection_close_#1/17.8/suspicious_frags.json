  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters themselves; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed. In this function: - There is no assignment to the parameter variable 'connection' (no statements like 'connection = ...', no increments/decrements). - There is no assignment to the parameter 'termination_code'. - All assignments seen (connection->rq.client_aware = false; connection->rp.response = NULL; connection->pool = NULL;) modify members of the object pointed to by 'connection', which is permitted. - Calls that pass 'connection' or addresses of its members do not constitute modification of the parameter variable itself. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
