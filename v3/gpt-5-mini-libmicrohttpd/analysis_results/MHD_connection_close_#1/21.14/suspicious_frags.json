  "explanation": "I inspected the entire MHD_connection_close_ function. There are no calls to memcmp or any other function that compares C-style null-terminated strings. The code only performs: pointer/NULL checks (e.g. NULL != daemon->notify_completed, NULL != resp, NULL != connection->pool), boolean/enum checks and assignments (connection->rq.client_aware, mhd_assert, termination_code), function calls (notify_completed, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_pool_destroy, MHD_connection_mark_closed_), and thread-related assertions. None of these compare character arrays or use memcmp to compare strings, so there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this function."
