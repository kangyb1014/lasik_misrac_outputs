  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are simple local assignments, initializations, or condition checks that do not themselves introduce unreachable code (e.g. declarations, setting local variables, simple assignment to connection->rq.client_aware = false). The selected fragments are places that must be investigated for potential unreachable-code violations: assertions and conditional callbacks which may abort/terminate, and calls to external functions (notify_completed, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_pool_destroy, MHD_connection_mark_closed_) whose implementation could not return (e.g. call exit/longjmp/abort) or otherwise make subsequent statements unreachable. The conditional compilation block is included because assertion behavior under MHD_USE_THREADS needs checking. Other lines do not contain control-flow constructs or calls that could make later code unreachable, so they do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1."
