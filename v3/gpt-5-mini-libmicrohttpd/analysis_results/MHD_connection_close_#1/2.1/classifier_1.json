  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement mhd_assert(! connection->suspended); is a runtime check (a macro that evaluates a condition) and does not itself create unreachable code: when the condition is true execution continues, when false typical assert behavior aborts/terminates at runtime. Only if mhd_assert were defined so that it unconditionally does not return (for every build/configuration) would the subsequent code be unreachable \u2014 but nothing in the fragment proves that to be the case."
