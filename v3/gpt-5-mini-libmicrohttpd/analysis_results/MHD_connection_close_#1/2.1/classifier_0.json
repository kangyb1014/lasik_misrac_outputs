  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the if-statement is reachable when connection->pool != NULL (the body executes to destroy and clear the pool). A Rule 2.1 violation would only occur if it can be proven (statically or by program logic) that connection->pool is always NULL at this point (for example, if all code paths leading here set connection->pool to NULL), making the then-branch unreachable \u2014 but nothing in the provided fragment establishes that, so the rule is not violated."
