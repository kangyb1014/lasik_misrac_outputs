  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment as written: page_content is declared as static const char[] and is passed without cast, so the pointer used refers to a const-qualified object. If, however, the MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static prototype were declared to take a non-const pointer (for example: struct MHD_Response *MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static(size_t size, void *buffer)), then this call would discard const qualification and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. To avoid a violation the API should accept a pointer to const (e.g. const void *buffer) or an explicit, justified cast should be documented."
