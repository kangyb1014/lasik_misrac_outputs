  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens (no __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __typeof__, statement-expression ({ ... }), or other vendor-specific keywords).\n- The backslash used between the two string literal pieces is a standard C line-continuation/concatenation mechanism and not a compiler extension. Adjacent string literal concatenation and backslash-newline removal are standard behavior.\n- The (void) cast to ignore a return value, static storage, enum usage, sizeof, and pointer usage are all standard C constructs.\n- The odd formatting (a semicolon placed on the next line) is purely stylistic and not an extension.\n\nOne caveat: the MHD_* identifiers (functions/macros) come from an external library; if any of those macros expand to compiler-specific extensions, that would be visible only in their definitions (not in this snippet). Based solely on the code shown, there are no explicit compiler-language extensions to report."
