  "explanation": "The remainder of the function consists of local declarations, static string/data definitions, a simple sizeof-based length computation, and return statements \u2014 none of these are function calls and therefore cannot create direct or indirect recursion. The function signature and local variable declarations do not invoke any callable behavior. The only code locations that could introduce indirect recursion are the explicit function calls listed above (creation, header addition, queuing, destruction); these should be investigated to determine whether any of those functions might (directly or indirectly) call reply_with_method_not_supported. No other fragments in this function can cause self-calls or indirect calls and thus do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
