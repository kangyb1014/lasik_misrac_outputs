  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The sole function parameter is the pointer 'c' (struct MHD_Connection *c): it is only passed to MHD_queue_response and never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise altered \u2014 so the pointer variable itself is not modified (passing the pointer to a function that may modify the pointed-to object is permitted by Rule 17.8). All other variables (resp, page_content, page_content_len) are local or static constants, not formal parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation for this rule."
