  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for use of compiler-specific language extensions. No explicit compiler extensions are present in the source text. In particular:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline__ (compiler-specific spelling), __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, __typeof__, __label__, or similar builtins.\n- There are no statement-expression constructs ({ ... }) used as an expression, no nested functions, no labels-as-values (&&label), and no inline assembly.\n- The pointer/const declaration (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;) and enum return usage are standard C (not compiler extensions). The Doxygen-style comment (/**< ... */) is a comment only, not a language extension.\n- The disabled #if 0 blocks contain plain C constructs (one contains return false; which is a standard boolean macro when <stdbool.h> is used) and no compiler extensions; moreover those blocks are inactive to the preprocessor.\n- Macros referenced (mhd_assert, MHD_HTTP_*, RP_BODY_*) are not expanded here; the visible code contains no explicit compiler extensions. If any of those macro expansions use compiler-specific extensions, they are not visible in this fragment and would need to be reviewed where they are defined.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as using compiler language extensions."
