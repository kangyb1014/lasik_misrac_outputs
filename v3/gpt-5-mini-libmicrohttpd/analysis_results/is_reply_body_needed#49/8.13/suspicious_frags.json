  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that should be const-qualified when possible. Other parts of the function do not involve pointer declarations or pointer-target types and thus do not need investigation under this rule: the rcode numeric range checks, mhd_assert() calls, comparisons against integer/enum constants (e.g. MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT, MHD_HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED), and the final returned enum values are not pointer-related. Likewise, simple comments and preprocessor directives that do not contain pointer expressions (other than the listed disabled blocks) are not relevant for Rule 8.13. The fragments above capture all occurrences in the function where pointer types or pointer dereferences appear and therefore warrant review for possible const qualification of the pointed-to types."
