  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The blocks wrapped in #if 0 are excluded by the preprocessor and therefore are not part of the translation unit; they are inactive source text, not code that exists in the compiled program and can never be executed. MISRA Rule 2.1 targets unreachable code in the program (code present in the translation unit that can never be executed, e.g. statements after a return), not text that has been removed by conditional compilation. If you want to avoid any potential scrutiny or static-tool warnings about \u2018dead\u2019 or disabled code, remove the #if 0 sections or convert them to ordinary comments, but as written this does not violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
