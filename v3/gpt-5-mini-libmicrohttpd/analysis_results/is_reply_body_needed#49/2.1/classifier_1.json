  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The block enclosed by `#if 0 ... #endif` is never compiled, so the `if ((MHD_HTTP_MTHD_CONNECT == c->rq.http_mthd) && (2 == rcode / 100)) return false;` path can never be reached. Having such code commented out via `#if 0` leaves unreachable code in the project and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Remove the dead code or document/restore it behind a meaningful feature macro to avoid the violation."
