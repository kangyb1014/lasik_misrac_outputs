  "explanation": "The two code regions wrapped in #if 0 are preprocessor-disabled and therefore unreachable in any build \u2014 they should be investigated as violations of Rule 2.1. No other obvious unreachable code fragments are present: all remaining returns are conditional on runtime values (rcode or c->rq.http_mthd) and therefore potentially reachable; the final return is the normal exit path; the local alias 'c' is used later; the mhd_assert() lines are macros for runtime checks (their presence does not by itself create statically unreachable code). Consequently only the #if 0 blocks require further investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
