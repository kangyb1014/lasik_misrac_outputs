  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies a function parameter. Details:\n- The pointer parameter 'connection' is not assigned to or modified; instead a local alias is created: \"struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;\" \u2014 the alias is a const pointer, so the pointer value cannot be changed via 'c'.\n- The integer parameter 'rcode' is only read (comparisons and arithmetic for tests), never assigned to.\n- All uses of the connection pointer are dereferences to read fields (e.g., c->rq.http_mthd), which is permitted by the rule (modifying the object pointed-to is allowed, though this function does not modify those objects either).\n- Disabled code in #if 0 blocks is not active; it contains no assignments to the parameters either.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
