  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical usage: mhd_assert is a runtime check (like assert) and can abort/log when the condition fails, so its presence affects behaviour in assertion-enabled builds and thus is not dead code. Specific violation scenario: if mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in all build configurations (e.g. #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0)), then the two calls have no effect and are dead code, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
