  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function is_reply_body_needed and found no usage of any string-handling functions from <string.h> (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). There are no other calls or code patterns that perform buffer or string operations (only integer/range checks, enum returns, mhd_assert, comparisons of fields in the connection struct, and code disabled by #if 0). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so nothing needs to be investigated for this rule."
