  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not introduce or pass non-const-qualified pointers and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter 'const char *buf' is already const-qualified. Local variables ('ret', 'off') are non-pointer scalar types. Calls to make_blocking and uses of errno do not involve pointer-to-object types that could/should be const-qualified. The only location that takes the address of an object (\"&buf[off]\") and passes it to an external API is the send() call (shown above); that call is potentially problematic only if the platform's send prototype expects a non-const pointer, which would discard the const qualifier. No other lines create or pass pointers that could be further const-qualified."
