  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: &buf[off] has type 'const char *' (buf is declared const char *), and it is passed to send which takes a const-qualified pointer (const void * or const char * depending on platform). The pointer is already const-qualified, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is satisfied."
