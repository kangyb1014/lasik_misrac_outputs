First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only constructs that can affect compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 are the for-loop header and any objects used there that are modified in the loop body. The rest of the function does not introduce additional loop counters or loop-control flags: off is the single loop counter (initialized in the first clause and only modified in the third clause), len is read-only in the loop condition, make_blocking(sock) is called before the loop (so it does not affect loop-clauses), the send invocation (aside from producing ret) is a normal function call inside the loop body, and the break conditions (if (0 > ret) ... break; and if (0 == ret) break;) do not introduce additional objects used in the for-clause. Therefore only the for header (third clause using ret) and the statements that assign/modify ret inside the loop body need investigation for Rule 14.2. No other fragments in the function create additional loop counters or use objects in the loop-clause that are modified by the loop body."
