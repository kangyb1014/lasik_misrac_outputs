  "explanation": "No other controlling expressions in this function appear to be invariant. The call to make_blocking(sock) is not a controlling expression and does not itself create an invariant loop condition. The remaining if-statements (e.g. if (0 > ret)) depend on the dynamically returned value ret and so are not statically invariant. The preprocessor branch that changes the type/format of the length argument to send does not by itself create an invariant controlling expression. There are no do-while loops or explicit infinite-loop constructs (e.g. for(;;) or while(1)) that would fall under the admitted exception for intentionally infinite loops."
