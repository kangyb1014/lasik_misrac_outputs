  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is an argument to send (len - off / (int)(len - off)), not a loop/conditional controlling expression. The actual loop controlling expression is 'off < len' which depends on off and len and is not invariant. A violating scenario would be if the loop condition itself were a compile-time constant (for example, for (off = 0; 0; off += (size_t)ret) or a condition that can be proven to be constant), but that is not the case here."
