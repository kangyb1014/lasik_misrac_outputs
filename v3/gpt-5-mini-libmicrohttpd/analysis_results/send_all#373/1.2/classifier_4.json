  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No language extensions are used in the fragment. The code uses standard preprocessor conditionals (#if/#else) and an explicit cast to int to match the Windows send() prototype; these are standard C features. The platform macros (_WIN32, __CYGWIN__) are predefined by compilers/headers, not language extensions, so Rule 1.2 is not violated."
