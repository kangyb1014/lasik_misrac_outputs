  "explanation": "Other code elements do not appear to rely on compiler language extensions. The function signature keywords (static, void), standard types and casts like size_t and (size_t) ret, the for-loop, pointer indexing (&buf[off]), control statements (if, break, continue), and usage of comments and preprocessor directives in general are standard C constructs and not compiler-specific extensions. Comparisons against 0, the use of errno handling flow, and simple arithmetic are also standard. The listed fragments are those that may involve platform- or implementation-specific types/macros or platform-dependent API behavior (ssize_t, MHD_socket, the send call with platform conditional and the use of EAGAIN/_WIN32/__CYGWIN__), and so should be investigated for compliance with Rule 1.2. No other constructs in the snippet exhibit obvious compiler-specific language extensions."
