Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_all:\n```c\nstatic void\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock,\n          const char *buf,\n          size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  make_blocking (sock);\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n    ret = send (sock,\n                &buf[off],\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n                len - off,\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n                (int) (len - off),\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n                0);\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nret = send (sock,\n                &buf[off],\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n                len - off,\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n                (int) (len - off),\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n                0);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation: the conditional-compilation selects one of two expressions at build time (either len - off or (int)(len - off)); the excluded branch is not compiled or executed. Dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour) is not present in this fragment, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
