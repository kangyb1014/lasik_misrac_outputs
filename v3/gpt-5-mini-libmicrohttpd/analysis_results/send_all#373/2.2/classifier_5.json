Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_all:\n```c\nstatic void\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock,\n          const char *buf,\n          size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  make_blocking (sock);\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n    ret = send (sock,\n                &buf[off],\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n                len - off,\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n                (int) (len - off),\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n                0);\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock,\n          const char *buf,\n          size_t len)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not demonstrate dead code. As shown, send_all is a function definition and may be invoked elsewhere; there is no evidence here that it is executed but removable. Therefore no violation can be concluded from this fragment alone. Specific violation scenario: if send_all is declared static and is not referenced anywhere in the same translation unit (i.e. never called), then its body would be dead code \u2014 removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 and that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
