  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect calls to the same function. The send_all implementation contains no direct call to send_all, so the only possible indirect recursion would come through functions it calls. Therefore the calls to make_blocking(sock) and to send(...) should be investigated to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call send_all. Other fragments (function signature, local variable declarations, the for loop control and index update, errno checks, break/continue handling, and the EAGAIN handling) do not perform function calls that could trigger indirect recursion and so do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
