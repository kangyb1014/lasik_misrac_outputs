  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: send_all calls the system/library function 'send' (a different function), so there is no direct or indirect call back to send_all in the shown fragment. (Only in the unusual case that 'send' were redefined to expand/alias to send_all would this become an indirect recursion.)"
