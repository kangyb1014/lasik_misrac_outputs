  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not marked because they are conditional on runtime inputs or compile-time macros and therefore cannot be classified as dead code without further context. Specifically:\n- Branches guarded by bind_options (MHD_DAUTH_BIND_NONCE_*) depend on the runtime value of bind_options and on saddr_size; removing those branches could change behavior.\n- The address-family handling (AF_INET / AF_INET6) depends on saddr->ss_family and the presence of HAVE_INET6; those calls update the digest with client address data and are not evidently removable.\n- Method handling (MHD_HTTP_MTHD_* / method / digest_update_str) depends on mthd_e and method input and thus is behaviorally significant.\n- URI and URI parameter loops depend on uri, uri_len, and the linked list first_header; these are runtime-dependent operations that affect the resulting nonce.\n- The #if / #ifdef blocks and uses of digest_get_size(da), digest_update, digest_calc_hash, and MHD_bin_to_hex rely on compile-time configuration and runtime digest state; their execution is not provably unnecessary.\nBecause dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2 is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, only the explicitly unconditional/peculiar fragments above were flagged for investigation; the rest must be reviewed with knowledge of runtime values and build configuration before concluding they are dead."
