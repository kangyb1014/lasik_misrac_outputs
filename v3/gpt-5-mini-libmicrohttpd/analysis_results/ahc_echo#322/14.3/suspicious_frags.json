  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. There are several conditional statements, but each depends on runtime values or function results and therefore should not be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: - if (0 != strcmp (method, \"GET\")) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of method and the result of strcmp. - if (&aptr != *req_cls) \u2014 depends on the incoming pointer *req_cls. - if (NULL == val) \u2014 depends on the result of MHD_lookup_connection_value at runtime. - if (0 >= resp_len) \u2014 depends on the result of snprintf computed with runtime input. - if (me == NULL) \u2014 depends on the result of malloc at runtime. - if (resp_len != snprintf (me, buf_size, PAGE, \"q\", val)) \u2014 depends on snprintf runtime formatting and inputs. - if (response == NULL) \u2014 depends on the result of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback. None of these are compile-time constant or invariant expressions. There are also no loops (for/while/do-while) with invariant controlling expressions; the allowed exception for invariant expressions forming infinite loops is therefore not applicable. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
