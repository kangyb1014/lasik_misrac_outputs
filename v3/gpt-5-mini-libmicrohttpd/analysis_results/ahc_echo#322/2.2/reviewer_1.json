It solely exists to suppress an unused-parameter compiler warning; therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 unless a documented justification (e.g. deviation) is provided.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour.\u201d The statement \u201c(void) upload_data_size;\u201d is an expression statement that evaluates the identifier and discards the result; it has no observable side\u2011effects (upload_data_size is an ordinary pointer, not volatile), so removing that statement would not change program behaviour. Therefore it meets the rule\u2019s definition of dead code. The same reasoning applies to the other (void) parameter casts in the function that only silence compiler warnings.\n\nIf upload_data_size (or any of the other parameters) were volatile or the expression had other side effects, removal could affect behaviour \u2014 in that case the statement would not be dead code. Absent such side effects, however, the agent A\u2019s report is correct: the cast-to-void statements are dead code under Rule 2.2 and require an approved justification/deviation or an alternative approach to handle unused parameters.\n"
