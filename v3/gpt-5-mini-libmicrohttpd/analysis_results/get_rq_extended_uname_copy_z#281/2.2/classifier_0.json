Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nget_rq_extended_uname_copy_z (const char *uname_ext, size_t uname_ext_len,\n                              char *buf, size_t buf_size)\n{\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n  if ((size_t) SSIZE_MAX < uname_ext_len)\n    return -1; /* Too long input string */\n\n  if (MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN > uname_ext_len)\n    return -1; /* Required prefix is missing */\n\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local variable 'chr' is assigned from uname_ext[r] and immediately used in the subsequent comparisons inside the loop. The assignment has an observable effect on control flow (the if that may return -1), so it is not dead code. Removing the assignment without adjusting the comparisons would be a compile error; replacing uses with uname_ext[r] would preserve behaviour but that would be a code change \u2014 the assignment as written is not an executed operation whose removal would leave program behaviour unchanged."
