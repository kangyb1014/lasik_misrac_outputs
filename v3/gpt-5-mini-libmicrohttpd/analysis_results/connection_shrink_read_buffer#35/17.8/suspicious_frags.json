  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter pointer 'connection' itself. The function immediately creates a const pointer alias: 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;' \u2014 the pointer variable c is const and not reassigned. All subsequent writes are to members of the object pointed to (e.g. c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size, c->read_buffer_offset), which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). There are no assignments to the parameter identifier 'connection'. The calls to MHD_pool_deallocate/MHD_pool_reallocate and the mhd_assert checks operate on members of *c and do not change the pointer parameter. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
