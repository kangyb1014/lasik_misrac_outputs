  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: c->read_buffer is used as a modifiable memory buffer and is passed to a pool reallocation routine that may change the memory (and returns a non-const void *). Rule 8.13 recommends using const-qualified pointed-to types only when the object is not modified \u2014 that is not the case here. A concrete violation scenario would be if the buffer were actually immutable (e.g. declared const void *read_buffer or pointing at a string literal) but code passed it as a plain void * (dropping const), or if the function did not modify the pointed-to data and the pointer type could have been declared const but was not."
