  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only performs a null/size check on c->read_buffer and does not declare or change pointer types. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should use const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified; this check does not constitute such a declaration. (If the struct member 'read_buffer' were declared as a non-const pointer despite never being modified, that declaration \u2014 not this fragment \u2014 would be the location of a potential Rule 8.13 violation.)"
