  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_shrink_read_buffer:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_shrink_read_buffer (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  void *new_buf;\n\n  if ((NULL == c->read_buffer) || (0 == c->read_buffer_size))\n  {\n    mhd_assert (0 == c->read_buffer_size);\n    mhd_assert (0 == c->read_buffer_offset);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  mhd_assert (c->read_buffer_offset <= c->read_buffer_size);\n  if (0 == c->read_buffer_offset)\n  {\n    MHD_pool_deallocate (c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size);\n    c->read_buffer = NULL;\n    c->read_buffer_size = 0;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    mhd_assert (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (c->pool, c->read_buffer, \\\n                                               c->read_buffer_size));\n    new_buf = MHD_pool_reallocate (c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size,\n                                   c->read_buffer_offset);\n    mhd_assert (c->read_buffer == new_buf);\n    c->read_buffer = new_buf;\n    c->read_buffer_size = c->read_buffer_offset;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nc->read_buffer = new_buf;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment c->read_buffer = new_buf; is not dead in general because MHD_pool_reallocate may return a different pointer; removing the assignment would change program behaviour when reallocation moves the buffer. Therefore the rule is not violated. (If, however, it can be proven for all builds and all inputs that MHD_pool_reallocate always returns the original pointer \u2014 as the mhd_assert suggests \u2014 the assignment would be redundant and constitute dead code.)"
