  "explanation": "No calls to any of the string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. All memory operations are via the pool API (MHD_pool_deallocate, MHD_pool_reallocate, MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace) rather than direct standard string/memory functions, so there are no direct uses of the string.h routines to inspect here. The code also performs explicit checks that prevent out-of-bounds adjustments of the read buffer: it guards against NULL or zero-size buffers, asserts that read_buffer_offset <= read_buffer_size, deallocates when offset is zero, and only resizes to read_buffer_offset when nonzero (after asserting the pool can resize in-place). Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
