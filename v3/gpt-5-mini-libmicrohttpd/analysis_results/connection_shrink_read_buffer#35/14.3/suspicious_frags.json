  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions of conditional and loop constructs. In this function the only controlling expressions are the two if-statements listed above, so they must be inspected for invariance. Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: declarations/aliasing (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;), variable definitions (void *new_buf;), return and assignment statements, the else branch and calls to MHD_pool_deallocate / MHD_pool_reallocate, and the mhd_assert() invocations are not controlling expressions (assert macros may evaluate expressions but are not control-flow constructs here). There are no loops in this function, so the loop-related exceptions to the rule do not apply."
