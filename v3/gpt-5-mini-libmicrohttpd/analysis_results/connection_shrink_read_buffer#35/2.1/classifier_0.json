  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The branch is reachable when the function is entered with a non-NULL read_buffer and read_buffer_size > 0 but read_buffer_offset == 0 (for example: c->read_buffer != NULL, c->read_buffer_size = 1024, c->read_buffer_offset = 0). The earlier guard only returns when the buffer is NULL or size == 0, so this branch can be executed and is not unreachable."
