  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided snippet. Specific notes: \n- The pointer declaration 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;' uses standard C const qualification. \n- The block comment '/**< a short alias */' is a standard C comment (/* ... */) form used for documentation and is not a compiler extension. \n- The backslash used to continue the long function-call line (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (c->pool, c->read_buffer, \\<newline> c->read_buffer_size)); is a standard preprocessing line-continuation and not a language extension. \n- All other constructs (static function, NULL comparisons, assignments, function calls, numeric literal comparisons) are standard C.\n\nCaveat: this analysis is limited to the visible source text. Macros or functions referenced here (mhd_assert, MHD_pool_reallocate, MHD_pool_deallocate, MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace) could expand to or be implemented using compiler-specific extensions, but those definitions are not present in the snippet; therefore they are not reported as suspicious in this fragment per the rule requirement to report only explicit uses of language extensions visible in the code shown."
