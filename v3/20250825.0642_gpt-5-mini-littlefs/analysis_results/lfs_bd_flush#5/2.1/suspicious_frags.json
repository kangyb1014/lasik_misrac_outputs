  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not selected because they do not present obvious unreachable-code patterns on their own. Specifically:\n- The outer conditional (if (pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_NULL && pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_INLINE)) is a runtime check using sentinel values; it does not constitute statically unreachable code.\n- Computation of diff (lfs_alignup) and the call to lfs->cfg->prog(...) are normal runtime operations that may legitimately execute and are not syntactically dead code.\n- The final call lfs_cache_zero(lfs, pcache); and the function return (return 0;) are reachable when the outer condition is true/false as designed.\n- The LFS_BLOCK_NULL and LFS_BLOCK_INLINE definitions are sentinels (negative casts) used in comparisons; their presence alone does not prove any branch is statically unreachable.\n\nI selected the fragments above because they can produce unreachable behavior depending on macro expansion or error-handling semantics (for example, assertions that may abort, and conditional branches that immediately return), and therefore warrant investigation for compliance with the MISRA Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code)."
