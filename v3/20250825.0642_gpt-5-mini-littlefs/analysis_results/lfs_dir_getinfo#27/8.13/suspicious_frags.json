  "explanation": "The only pointer targets in this function that could plausibly be const-qualified (because they are not visibly modified here) are the lfs and dir parameters; those are therefore reported for investigation. Other pointer-related fragments in the function do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - info (struct lfs_info *info) is written to (info->name, info->type, info->size), so it cannot be const-qualified. - info->name is used as an output buffer (passed to lfs_dir_get and written via strcpy), so it must be a mutable char array. - The local struct lfs_ctz ctz is modified (lfs_dir_get writes into &ctz and lfs_ctz_fromle32(&ctz) mutates it), so its address cannot be const-qualified. - Non-pointer objects (id, tag, size computations) are not relevant to Rule 8.13. No other pointer variables appear in the function body that would need const-qualification."
