This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- lfs_t (definition): The function dereferences lfs and uses members lookahead and block_count. You need the full definition of lfs_t to know the types and layout of those members.\n\n- lfs_block_t (typedef): The calculation of off uses arithmetic and modulo on values of type lfs_block_t. Knowing its underlying integer type and signedness/width is necessary to determine whether the arithmetic (block - start), the addition of block_count, and the % operation can produce unexpected values or signed-integer undefined behaviour that could lead to out-of-bounds indexing.\n\n- lfs->lookahead (structure definition: fields start, size, buffer): The code uses lookahead.start, lookahead.size and lookahead.buffer. You must know the types of start and size (to reason about ranges and comparisons), and the type of buffer (e.g., uint8_t *, uint8_t[], etc.) to know element size and indexing semantics.\n\n- lookahead.buffer allocation/size symbol(s): To prove the indexing buffer[off/8] is safe you must know how many bytes were actually allocated (or the compile-time size of the array). Specifically, you need the expression or macro that gives the buffer length in bytes (typically ceil(lookahead.size/8)), or the allocation call that set buffer and its length. Without this you cannot determine whether off/8 can exceed the buffer bounds.\n\n- lfs->block_count (field in lfs_t): The computation of off uses block_count in the modulo and as part of range reasoning. Knowing its type and any invariants (e.g., non-zero, maximum value) is required to reason about the range of off and hence valid indices into the buffer.\n\n- initialization/validation code that sets/limits lookahead.start and lookahead.size (functions or asserts): The protection if (off < lookahead.size) is used to avoid writing past tracked blocks; to verify this actually prevents out-of-bounds access you must inspect the code that sets start and size (and any invariants or runtime checks) to ensure lookahead.size and start are within expected ranges and that buffer was sized consistently with lookahead.size.\n\nIn short: to decide whether buffer[off/8] |= 1U << (off % 8) can access beyond the allocated object, you must know the concrete types/widths of the block identifiers and the exact allocation/size of lookahead.buffer and the invariants on lookahead.size/start/block_count. These are the minimal additional symbols needed to perform that MISRA C string-boundary style analysis."
