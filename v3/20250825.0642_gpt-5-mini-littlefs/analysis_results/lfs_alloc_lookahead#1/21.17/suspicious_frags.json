  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring those calls do not access beyond object bounds. The provided function lfs_alloc_lookahead contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. All operations are integer arithmetic, indexing into lfs->lookahead.buffer using a computed index (off / 8), and a bitwise shift using (off % 8). Therefore there are no string.h usages to inspect for Rule 21.17 compliance. (Note: while bounds-checking of the computed index or the correctness of the cast of p to lfs_t* may be relevant to other MISRA rules or general safety reviews, they are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and so are not reported here.)"
