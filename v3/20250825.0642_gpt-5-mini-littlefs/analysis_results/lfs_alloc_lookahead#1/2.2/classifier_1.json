  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_alloc_lookahead:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_alloc_lookahead(void *p, lfs_block_t block) {\n    lfs_t *lfs = (lfs_t*)p;\n    lfs_block_t off = ((block - lfs->lookahead.start)\n            + lfs->block_count) % lfs->block_count;\n\n    if (off < lfs->lookahead.size) {\n        lfs->lookahead.buffer[off / 8] |= 1U << (off % 8);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nlfs_block_t off = ((block - lfs->lookahead.start)\n            + lfs->block_count) % lfs->block_count;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The value 'off' is used in the subsequent test (if (off < lfs->lookahead.size)) and in the bit write (buffer[off/8] |= 1U << (off%8)); removing the computation would change program behaviour. A concrete violation would occur only if it can be proven that the result is never used (for example if lfs->lookahead.size is statically known to be 0 so the conditional is always false), in which case the computation of 'off' would be dead code."
