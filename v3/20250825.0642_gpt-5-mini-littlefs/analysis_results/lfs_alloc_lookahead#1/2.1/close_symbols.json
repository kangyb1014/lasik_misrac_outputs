  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol (needed to decide if any branch/statement is unreachable):\n\n- typedef lfs_block_t: The integer type and signedness/width determine arithmetic, subtraction, modulo and comparison semantics. Whether (block - start) can be negative, and how % behaves, depends on the underlying type.\n\n- struct lfs_t: The layout of lfs_t is required to locate the fields used by the function and to understand their types and relationships.\n\n- lfs_t::block_count: The value and type of block_count determine the modulus operand and the range of off (off is computed modulo block_count). If block_count can be zero the modulo is undefined (possible unreachable or UB). If block_count=1 the if-condition off < size may be trivially true/false.\n\n- type/definition of lfs->lookahead (lookahead struct): Needed to know the types of start, size, buffer and any invariants attached to the lookahead structure.\n\n- lookahead.start: Start participates in (block - start). Its type and range/constraints determine possible values of off.\n\n- lookahead.size: The comparison off < lookahead.size is the conditional that may be unreachable; knowing possible values of size (including if it is always 0 or always > block_count) is essential.\n\n- lookahead.buffer and its allocated length / buffer-size constant: The write uses buffer[off/8]; to judge reachability of that statement you must know whether any off values that satisfy the if can produce an index out of bounds (and whether the if branch is ever taken at all).\n\n- all call sites (callers) of lfs_alloc_lookahead: Callers constrain the argument block and the state of the lfs object when this function is invoked. A branch may be unreachable in practice even if it is reachable syntactically, depending on callers' preconditions.\n\n- functions that initialize or modify lookahead.start and lookahead.size: These routines establish invariants (e.g., size is always zero until initialized, start is within a certain range). Those invariants are necessary to prove whether off < size can ever hold.\n\n- configuration/invariant symbols that constrain block and block_count ranges: Any configuration constants or checks (e.g., maximum blocks, compile-time asserts, runtime checks) that guarantee relationships between block, start, size and block_count are needed to determine if the if-condition or the body are unreachable.\n\nInclude these symbols/definitions in the next-agent prompt so it can determine concrete value ranges and reachability of the conditional and buffer write (MISRA rule about unreachable code)."
