  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp (or any other string-comparison function such as strcmp/strncmp/strcpy) are present in this function. The code only performs: a pointer cast to lfs_t, integer arithmetic on block indices, an integer comparison (off < lfs->lookahead.size), array indexing into lookahead.buffer, and a bitwise OR with a shifted unsigned constant. There are no char arrays, no null-terminated string handling, and no calls to functions from <string.h>. Therefore nothing in this fragment is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings) and no fragments need to be reported for investigation."
