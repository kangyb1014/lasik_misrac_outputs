  "scenario": "The function writes to members of *lfs (lfs->lookahead.buffer[...] |= ...), so the pointed-to object is intentionally mutable. Rule 8.13 asks for const qualification when a pointer does not need to modify the object. Here the pointer is used for modification, so using a non-const lfs_t * is appropriate. This would only be a violation if the function did not modify the object (in which case the parameter should be const void */const lfs_t *) or if a const-qualified object were cast to this non-const pointer (removing const), which is not shown here."
