  "explanation": "I report only constructs that may be implemented as compiler-specific language extensions in some toolchains: the // single-line comment syntax, the designated-initializer style used in the local struct initializer, and the use of the C99 bool type in the struct definition. All other code in the provided snippets uses standard C constructs (function signature, array parameter, pointer dereference, while loop, return statements, macro cast ((lfs_block_t)-1), integer assignments, and ordinary declarations). There are no other obvious compiler-specific extensions in the code (no inline assembly, no __attribute__ or __declspec, no typeof, no statement-expressions, no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific keywords or builtins). Therefore those other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
