  "explanation": "No code fragment violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 in this function. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters (lfs and pdir) themselves are never reassigned in the function; only the object pointed-to by pdir is modified (pdir->tail[0] = 0; pdir->tail[1] = 1;), which is permitted by the rule.\n- The array parameter pair is declared const and is not modified anywhere in the function.\n- There are no assignments to the parameter variables lfs, pair, or pdir. (Local shadowing of the variable err inside the while loop is not a modification of a function parameter and is therefore irrelevant to Rule 17.8.)\nTherefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
