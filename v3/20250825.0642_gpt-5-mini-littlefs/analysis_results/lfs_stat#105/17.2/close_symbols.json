  "explanation": "To determine if lfs_stat violates the MISRA rule against (direct or indirect) recursion you must inspect the functions it calls and their transitive callees:\n- lfs_stat_: directly invoked by lfs_stat; any path from here back to lfs_stat (or to lfs_stat_) would create indirect recursion.\n- lfs_dir_find: callee of lfs_stat_; must be checked for calls (direct or via further callees) that lead back to lfs_stat/lfs_stat_.\n- lfs_tag_type3: callee of lfs_stat_; must be checked for paths that could return to lfs_stat/lfs_stat_.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: callee of lfs_stat_; must be checked for paths that could return to lfs_stat/lfs_stat_.\n- lfs_tag_id: callee of lfs_stat_; must be checked for paths that could return to lfs_stat/lfs_stat_.\n\n(If any of these functions call additional functions, those transitive callees must also be examined for cycles back to lfs_stat.)"
