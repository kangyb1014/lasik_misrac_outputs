  "scenario": "The single statement 'int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);' does not itself declare a pointer and therefore does not by itself violate Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when they are only used for read access. However, a related violation could exist elsewhere: if the lfs_t type declares its configuration pointer as a non-const (for example 'struct lfs_config *cfg;') but the code (including LFS_LOCK and other users) only reads from the config, then that declaration should be 'const struct lfs_config *cfg;' and the current non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13."
