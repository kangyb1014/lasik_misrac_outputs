  "explanation": "I only flagged occurrences that involve the lfs pointer or pass pointer parameters through the function (declaration and all uses), since MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers could/should be to const-qualified types. The path parameter is already const-qualified (const char *), so it does not need investigation. The info parameter is likely an output buffer (struct lfs_info *info) and therefore intentionally non-const; its internal fields are not pointer types needing const qualification (e.g., char name[]), so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13. Other lines (trace return, unlocking trace, return err, braces) do not introduce additional pointer types that could be const-qualified and therefore do not require investigation for this rule."
