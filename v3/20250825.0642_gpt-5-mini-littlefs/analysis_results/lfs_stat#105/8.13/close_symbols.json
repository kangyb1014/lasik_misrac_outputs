  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule about pointers being const-qualified when possible you must know the exact pointer types and where const is or is not used. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_stat_: The target simply forwards work to lfs_stat_. You must see its prototype/definition to know whether it accepts path and info as const-qualified pointers or whether it requires non-const pointers (which would indicate const is being discarded or lost).\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_dir_getinfo, lfs_tag_id: These are the callees of lfs_stat_. Their signatures determine how path, info, or other pointers are propagated/used inside lfs_stat_. If any of these expect non-const pointers or perform writes through pointers, that affects whether the original pointers should be const.\n\n- typedef/definition of lfs_t (including member cfg): lfs_stat uses lfs->cfg as an argument to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. You need the lfs_t layout to know the type of cfg and whether cfg itself is a pointer to const-qualified data or could/should be const.\n\n- typedef/definition of the cfg type (the type of lfs->cfg): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK operate on this object. Their prototypes and the cfg type determine whether these APIs require mutable pointers (preventing const qualification) or could accept const pointers.\n\n- struct lfs_info definition: lfs_stat takes struct lfs_info *info. To decide if info could be const, you must know whether info is written to by lfs_stat_ or downstream callees (fields mutated), so you need the type and its usage in called functions.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Their parameter types show whether they accept const-qualified cfg pointers. If they require a non-const pointer, that forces lfs->cfg (and possibly lfs_t definition) to be non-const.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/definition): lfs_stat calls LFS_TRACE with path and (void*)info. You need the macro signature to see whether it forces casts that drop const (e.g., expects void* or char*), which can create const-qualification violations (casting away const is relevant to the MISRA rule).\n\nProviding these symbols (prototypes/definitions) allows a precise determination whether any pointer parameters or members in lfs_stat should/should not be const-qualified, and whether the function or its callees discard const qualifications in violation of the MISRA rule."
