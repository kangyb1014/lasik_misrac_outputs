  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- LFS_LOCK: The controlling expression in the target is if (err) where err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must inspect LFS_LOCK (macro or function) to determine whether it returns an invariant value (constant/always-zero/always-nonzero) or whether it has side effects that change err. If LFS_LOCK is a macro that expands to a constant or to a do/while(0) pattern, that affects whether the if expression is invariant or whether exceptions apply.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although not used directly in the if controlling expression, LFS_UNLOCK may be a macro that uses a do { ... } while(0) pattern (an MISRA-allowed exception) or may have other macro-control constructs. Inspecting it is necessary to ensure no invariant controlling expressions are introduced by unlock-related macros in the target function.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This tracing macro is invoked twice in the function and may expand to control-flow constructs (commonly do { ... } while(0)). MISRA explicitly permits a do-while with a false integer constant expression as an exception; you must check the exact expansion of LFS_TRACE to confirm it does not introduce a non-allowed invariant controlling expression.\n\n- lfs_stat_: The call result overwrites err and the function call is part of the function flow. To fully determine whether any controlling expression in lfs_stat (including the later return path and any dependence on err) could be invariant or rely on side effects, you need lfs_stat_ implementation (and its use of control constructs) to confirm no hidden invariant controlling expressions propagate into lfs_stat.\n\n- struct lfs_t (and the type of lfs->cfg): LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg. To understand what LFS_LOCK does and whether its behavior depends on cfg (and therefore whether err can vary), you must know the type/layout of lfs_t and the cfg member type used by LFS_LOCK.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyst determine whether any controlling expression in the target function is invariant, or whether expansions/side-effects fall under the MISRA exceptions (infinite loops or do-while false constant)."
