  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_stat violates the MISRA string-bounds rule you must inspect not only lfs_stat (which delegates work to lfs_stat_) but the full implementations and relevant data shapes used by its callees. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_stat_: primary worker called by lfs_stat; it may call string/memory operations on 'path' or 'info' and must be examined for out-of-bounds uses.\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_dir_getinfo, lfs_tag_id: these are the callees of lfs_stat_. Any use of string.h functions (memcmp/memcpy/strcpy/strlen etc.) inside them could produce out-of-bounds accesses. Their bodies and call-sites must be inspected.\n- struct lfs_t: the layout (especially pointers and buffer members) is required to know the valid object sizes and lifetimes referenced by lfs_stat and its callees.\n- struct lfs_info: fields (for example a name buffer or size fields) determine whether copies/reads into info overflow; you need its definition to reason about bounds.\n- lfs->cfg type / lfs_config: configuration fields often contain size limits (e.g. name or block sizes) that the code relies on to bound string/memory operations.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their definitions may access cfg or perform operations that influence buffer access/ordering; include to ensure no hidden string operations or side effects.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing/logging macros often format strings (snprintf/strcpy) and may use path/info without length checks; include to check for unsafe uses in tracing.\n- LFS_NAME_MAX / any name/path-size constants/macros: these constants define the intended maximum sizes used in bounds checks; needed to verify correct comparisons against buffer sizes.\n- Any helper/wrapper functions called by the above: those helpers may contain string.h calls; include them so no call-site that manipulates buffers is missed.\n- The standard <string.h> functions (memcmp, memcpy, memmove, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): include these as symbols to locate all call sites in the implementations above so each use can be audited for potential out-of-bounds access.\n\nCollecting these symbols (implementations and definitions) allows a precise analysis of pointer targets, buffer sizes, and each string/memory operation to determine whether accesses can exceed object bounds in accordance with the MISRA rule."
