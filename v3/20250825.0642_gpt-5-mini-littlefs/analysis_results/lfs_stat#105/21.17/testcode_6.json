  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nYes. The call strcspn(name, \"/\") assumes that 'name' points to a valid, NUL-terminated character array. There is no check that 'path' (and therefore 'name') is non-NULL or that a terminating '\\0' exists within the bounds of the object. If the caller supplies a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffer (or an invalid/NULL pointer), strcspn will scan past the object\u2019s bounds searching for '/' or '\\0', causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses and undefined behavior. Therefore Rule 21.17 is violated.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_stat code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1059.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_stat as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_stat:\n```c\nint lfs_stat(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path, struct lfs_info *info) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_stat(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %p)\", (void*)lfs, path, (void*)info);\n\n    err = lfs_stat_(lfs, path, info);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_stat -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_stat code.\n",
