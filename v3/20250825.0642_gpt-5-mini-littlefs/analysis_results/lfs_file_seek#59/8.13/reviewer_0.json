True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes (struct lfs_mlist*)file to lfs_mlist_isopen which is declared as taking non-const pointers, but lfs_mlist_isopen only inspects the list and does not modify *head or *node. Therefore the parameters (and the argument) could and should be const-qualified (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *). By using a non-const pointer/cast here the code fails to qualify pointers as const where possible, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A fix is to change lfs_mlist_isopen to take const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node and call it with (const struct lfs_mlist*)file (or avoid the cast if types permit).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_seek:\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        lfs_soff_t off, int whence) {\n    // find new pos\n    //\n    // fortunately for us, littlefs is limited to 31-bit file sizes, so we\n    // don't have to worry too much about integer overflow\n    lfs_off_t npos = file->pos;\n    if (whence == LFS_SEEK_SET) {\n        npos = off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_CUR) {\n        npos = file->pos + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_END) {\n        npos = (lfs_off_t)lfs_file_size_(lfs, file) + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    }\n\n    if (npos > lfs->file_max) {\n        // file position out of range\n        return LFS_ERR_INVAL;\n    }\n\n    if (file->pos == npos) {\n        // noop - position has not changed\n        return npos;\n    }\n\n    // if we're only reading and our new offset is still in the file's cache\n    // we can avoid flushing and needing to reread the data\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_READING)\n            && file->off != lfs->cfg->block_size) {\n        int oindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){file->pos});\n        lfs_off_t noff = npos;\n        int nindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &noff);\n        if (oindex == nindex\n                && noff >= file->cache.off\n                && noff < file->cache.off + file->cache.size) {\n            file->pos = npos;\n            file->off = noff;\n            return npos;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // write out everything beforehand, may be noop if rdonly\n    int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // update pos\n    file->pos = npos;\n    return npos;\n}\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. lfs_mlist_isopen takes non-const struct lfs_mlist * parameters but only inspects the list and does not modify the pointed-to objects. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible. The current implementation (and the call which casts to (struct lfs_mlist*)file) therefore fails to qualify the parameters as const. Note that the function body currently uses a pointer-to-pointer idiom (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head) which is not directly compatible with changing the parameters to const without adjusting the loop. A simple, safe fix is to change the prototype to static bool lfs_mlist_isopen(const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node) and iterate with a const pointer (for (const struct lfs_mlist *p = head; p; p = p->next) ...) so no cast is needed at the call site. If the function actually needs to modify nodes or use pointer-to-pointer semantics elsewhere, then const cannot be applied; but given the shown implementation it can and should be const-qualified."
