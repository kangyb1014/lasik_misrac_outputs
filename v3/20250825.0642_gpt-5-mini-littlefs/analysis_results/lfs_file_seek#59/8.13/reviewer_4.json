According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, these should be const-qualified. The current implementation also takes the address of the parameter (&head) into a struct lfs_mlist **, which prevents simply making head const; the loop should instead iterate with a (const) pointer to the nodes. Example fix: change the signature to 'static bool lfs_mlist_isopen(const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node)' and loop with 'for (const struct lfs_mlist *p = head; p; p = p->next) { if (p == node) return true; }'.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_seek:\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        lfs_soff_t off, int whence) {\n    // find new pos\n    //\n    // fortunately for us, littlefs is limited to 31-bit file sizes, so we\n    // don't have to worry too much about integer overflow\n    lfs_off_t npos = file->pos;\n    if (whence == LFS_SEEK_SET) {\n        npos = off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_CUR) {\n        npos = file->pos + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_END) {\n        npos = (lfs_off_t)lfs_file_size_(lfs, file) + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    }\n\n    if (npos > lfs->file_max) {\n        // file position out of range\n        return LFS_ERR_INVAL;\n    }\n\n    if (file->pos == npos) {\n        // noop - position has not changed\n        return npos;\n    }\n\n    // if we're only reading and our new offset is still in the file's cache\n    // we can avoid flushing and needing to reread the data\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_READING)\n            && file->off != lfs->cfg->block_size) {\n        int oindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){file->pos});\n        lfs_off_t noff = npos;\n        int nindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &noff);\n        if (oindex == nindex\n                && noff >= file->cache.off\n                && noff < file->cache.off + file->cache.size) {\n            file->pos = npos;\n            file->off = noff;\n            return npos;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // write out everything beforehand, may be noop if rdonly\n    int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // update pos\n    file->pos = npos;\n    return npos;\n}\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. The implementation of lfs_mlist_isopen neither modifies the list nodes nor the node pointer; it only tests for identity. Therefore both parameters could and should be const-qualified (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node). The current implementation uses the &head / struct lfs_mlist ** trick to traverse pointer-to-pointer locations, which forces non-const pointer types; that is an implementation choice that prevents applying const but is not required. Changing the loop to iterate with a const pointer (for (const struct lfs_mlist *p = head; p; p = p->next) ...) and updating the signature to accept const pointers fixes the issue and conforms to Rule 8.13. Thus the agent A's report is correct."
