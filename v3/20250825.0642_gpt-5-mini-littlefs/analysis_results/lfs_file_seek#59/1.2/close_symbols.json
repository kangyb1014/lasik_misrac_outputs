  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule 'Language extensions should not be used' you must inspect any macro/typedef/function declarations used directly by lfs_file_seek, because extensions commonly hide in macro expansions, typedef attributes, or function declarations. Reasons per symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: macro used for locking. Its definition may expand to compiler-specific builtins, inline asm, __attribute__ annotations, or other extensions. Inspect to ensure only standard C is used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (may hide compiler builtins or attributes).\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro; may be a variadic macro, call a function with GCC attributes, or use compiler-specific features (e.g. __attribute__((format)), __func__, or inline asm). Need its definition/expansion.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may use extensions (typeof, statement expressions, __extension__, or compiler attributes). Inspect expansion for non-standard constructs.\n- PRId32: format macro from inttypes.h used in the format string. Confirm it is the standard macro and not a project/compiler-specific redefinition that uses extensions.\n- lfs_soff_t: return type of the function. Its typedef/definition could use implementation- or compiler-specific integer types (e.g. __int128) or attributes (aligned, packed) that are language extensions.\n- lfs_t: opaque filesystem type used in parameter list. Its struct/typedef may contain compiler-specific extensions or attributes; inspect declaration.\n- lfs_file_t: file handle type. Its declaration could use extensions (anonymous unions/structs, attributes, compiler-specific storage class qualifiers, etc.).\n- struct lfs_mlist: used in the cast to call lfs_mlist_isopen. The struct definition may contain non-standard members or extension keywords (anonymous structs/unions can be extension in some C versions), so inspect it.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: prototype must be inspected for any function attributes (e.g. __attribute__ or inline asm) or non-standard parameter types/macros.\n- lfs_file_seek_: the internal seek implementation called here; its declaration/definition might carry attributes (inline, noreturn, format) or use non-standard constructs that affect the call.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions/decls allows the next analyzer to expand macros and review typedefs/declarations for any compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
