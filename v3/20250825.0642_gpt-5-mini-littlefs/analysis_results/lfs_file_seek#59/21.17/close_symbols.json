  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis:\n\n- lfs_file_seek_: This is the direct worker called by lfs_file_seek. Any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* that could produce out-of-bounds accesses will be inside this function, so its body must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_file_size_: Called by lfs_file_seek_. It may examine or compute file sizes and buffer lengths and may itself call string/memory functions; its index/length calculations affect bounds reasoning in the seek logic.\n\n- lfs_ctz_index: Used by lfs_file_seek_ to compute indexes/offsets. Correct index computations are critical to determine whether subsequent memory/string operations touch out-of-bounds memory.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called by lfs_file_seek_ (flush may copy or clear buffers). It could use memcpy/memset or similar operations that must be inspected for bounds safety.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called via LFS_ASSERT in lfs_file_seek. Even though it has no callees in the provided graph, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call string.h functions or perform out-of-bounds accesses on the file/list structures.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions affect control flow and return values (err). They may access configuration or lock buffers; include them to ensure no hidden string/memory ops or pointer dereferences that impact bounds.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Expands into code that evaluates the condition; the expansion may include helpers or diagnostics that use string/memory functions or dereference pointers, so it must be checked.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/logging macros can invoke formatting or buffer-copy routines (snprintf/strcpy/strlen) that use string functions; ensure those uses do not create out-of-bounds writes/reads.\n\n- lfs_soff_t, lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist, lfs->cfg: The concrete types and configuration fields determine sizes, valid ranges, and buffer pointers used by the functions above. Accurate bounds analysis of any string/memory calls requires knowledge of these types and the layout/limits of the referenced objects.\n\nNote: The listed symbols cover the direct callees and macros visible from lfs_file_seek plus the types needed to reason about buffer sizes and indices. Any further callees discovered inside these functions should also be inspected for string.h usage."
