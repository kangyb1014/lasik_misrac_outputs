  "explanation": "- lfs_mkdir_: The only direct callee. You must inspect its prototype and body to ensure that nothing in the call (or its prototype) causes modification of the lfs or path parameter variables in lfs_mkdir (e.g. signature mismatches that discard const, or unusual macros/inline wrappers). Even though modifications inside lfs_mkdir_ do not directly change the caller's parameter variables, its prototype or wrapper could reveal casts/side-effects relevant to MISRA checks (e.g. passing a non-const char* parameter from a const char* argument). \n\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro (or wrapper) used at the start. A macro expansion can contain arbitrary code; you must verify the expansion does not assign to or otherwise modify the local parameter identifiers lfs or path (for example, by using them as lvalues via macro abuse). Also check if it expands to calls that take the address of the parameter variable (very unlikely but must be ruled out).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 inspect its definition/expansion to ensure it cannot modify the function parameters.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace macro is passed both parameters (and may expand to code or function calls). Verify its expansion does not perform assignments to parameter identifiers or otherwise modify them (formatting/varargs use is typically safe, but the macro could be more complex).\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): To confirm that \"lfs\" is a plain parameter name (not a macro), to inspect members (like cfg) used in the macros, and to ensure there are no strange typedefs/overloads that could permit modification of the parameter variable via member access or macro interaction. This helps confirm whether accesses like lfs->cfg are safe w.r.t. the MISRA rule (modifying members is allowed; modifying the pointer parameter is not)."
