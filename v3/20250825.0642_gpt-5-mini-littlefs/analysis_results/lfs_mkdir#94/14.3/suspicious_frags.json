The calls and statements that remain (LFS_TRACE invocations, the call to lfs_mkdir_(lfs, path), the final LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg), and return err;) are not loop/branch controlling expressions or their controlling expressions are not constant invariants. No do-while or intentionally infinite-loop constructs are present that would fall under the exceptions to Rule 14.3."
