  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'buffer' is already declared const and 'data' is a const-qualified pointer to that buffer; the local array 'uint8_t dat[8]' is written to (so it must be non-const); memcmp is called with a const-qualified second argument and accepts a non-const first argument by conversion to const void*; all other parameters (hint, block, off, size) are non-pointer scalar types. Therefore only the non-const pointer usages shown above warrant further inspection."
