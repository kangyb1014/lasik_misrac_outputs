  "explanation": "I only flagged calls to the standard string handling functions (memcmp and memcpy) because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns these functions and whether their size/pointer arguments can cause out-of-bounds accesses. Other code fragments do not call functions from <string.h> and therefore are not relevant to this rule. Additionally, many surrounding operations provide bounds-related checks and constraints (e.g. diff is computed with lfs_min and limited by sizeof(dat) in lfs_bd_cmp; lfs_bd_read performs checks such as off+size <= block_size and conditional adjustments using pcache/rcache offsets and sizes) which are not string.h usages and so do not need to be investigated under Rule 21.17."
