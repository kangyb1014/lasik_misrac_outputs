  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies a function parameter variable itself. There are no assignments to the pointer parameters (no statements like \"dir = ...\" or \"lfs = ...\"). The places that write through pointers (dir->id = 0; dir->pos = 0;) modify the objects referred to by the pointer parameter, which is permitted by Rule 17.8. Passing &dir->m and dir->head to lfs_dir_fetch only passes addresses/values and does not reassign the parameter variables. The macros LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, and LFS_TRACE expand to no-ops or expressions that do not modify the pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of Rule 17.8."
