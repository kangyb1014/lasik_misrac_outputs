  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro or function that may not return (e.g. longjmp/abort) or may modify control flow; need its definition/behaviour to decide if the early 'if (err) return err;' or subsequent code is reachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: May be a macro/function that does not return or alters control flow; if it does not return then the final 'return err;' would be unreachable. Include its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: Although typically a logging macro, it could expand to code that affects control flow (e.g. asserts, returns). Include its definition to ensure the trace calls do not make surrounding code unreachable.\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: The target calls this function and assigns its return to err; if lfs_dir_rewind_ does not return (or always returns a fixed way) that affects reachability of the TRACE/LFS_UNLOCK/return that follow. Include its full implementation or prototype.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: lfs_dir_rewind_ calls this function (per call graph); to determine whether lfs_dir_rewind_ can return normally you may need the behaviour/definition of lfs_dir_fetch as it may cause non-returning control flow.\n- lfs_t (definition): The struct type and its members (notably 'cfg') are needed to understand what is passed into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and whether those accesses could have side-effects impacting reachability.\n- lfs_dir_t (definition): The directory object type is an argument; its contents may be referenced by called functions and affect control flow \u2014 include its definition for completeness.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg type / definition): The exact type of the cfg member (e.g. lfs_cfg_t or struct) is needed because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take it as an argument; their behaviour may depend on this type and its state.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions so the next analysis can determine whether any path in lfs_dir_rewind is statically unreachable under the real macro/function implementations."
