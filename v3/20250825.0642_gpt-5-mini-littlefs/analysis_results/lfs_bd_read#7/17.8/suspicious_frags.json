  "explanation": "The reported fragments are the only places in this function where function parameters are modified (the parameters 'off' and 'size' are assigned to via \"off += diff;\" and \"size -= diff;\"). These must be investigated for Rule 17.8. Other assignments in the function do not violate the rule: writes to rcache->... modify the object referred to by the pointer parameter rcache (allowed by the rule), pcache is const and not modified, the local variable data is derived from the pointer parameter buffer but is a separate local variable (modifying data does not modify the parameter 'buffer'), and diff is a local variable initialized from size (reading a parameter is allowed). No other occurrences of assignments to parameter variables exist in the function, so no additional fragments need investigation."
