  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: \n- pcache is already declared as const lfs_cache_t *pcache, satisfying the rule.\n- rcache is intentionally a non-const lfs_cache_t * because the function modifies its members (rcache->block, rcache->off, rcache->size, and its buffer is written by read), so it cannot be made a pointer-to-const.\n- buffer (void *buffer) and the derived uint8_t *data are destinations for data written by memcpy() and the cfg->read() callback; they must remain non-const so the function can store data into them.\n- The memcpy() calls use appropriate source/destination semantics (pcache is const-qualified, rcache is a writable cache), so they do not indicate missing const-qualification.\n- Local integer and size variables are non-pointer types and not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n\nTherefore the only places that warrant checking for possible const-qualification are the function parameter lfs_t *lfs (it appears not to be modified in this function and could potentially be const-qualified) and the calls that pass lfs->cfg as an argument to cfg->read (to ensure the pointed-to configuration object and the read callback signatures align with const-correctness)."
