  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The argument path is a const char * (preserving const qualification) and dir is an output/modifyable lfs_dir_t * (non-const appropriately, since the function will initialize/modify it). This call therefore does not violate Rule 8.13. (Note: a violation would occur if the callee lfs_dir_open_ were declared to take a non-const char * for path despite not needing to modify the string, but that declaration is not present in the fragment.)"
