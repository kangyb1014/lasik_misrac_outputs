  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The call site alone does not establish a MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (and function parameter types) being const-qualified where possible \u2014 you must look at the declaration/definition of LFS_UNLOCK and the type of lfs->cfg. From the snippet we only see a call LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); we do not see the prototype of LFS_UNLOCK nor the type of lfs->cfg, nor whether LFS_UNLOCK actually modifies the object. Therefore you cannot conclude a violation just from this call. If LFS_UNLOCK is declared to take a non-const pointer but does not (and cannot) modify the pointed-to object, then the correct fix would be to change the LFS_UNLOCK parameter to a pointer to const (and similarly adjust the cfg member type as appropriate) \u2014 in that case the violation would be in the LFS_UNLOCK declaration/definition, not in this call site. Given the available information, the agent A report is not supported."
