  "scenario": "No violation: the code casts non-const pointers (lfs_t *lfs and lfs_dir_t *dir) to (void*) solely for printing and passes the const char *path unchanged. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types where possible; here lfs and dir are non-const because they are (presumably) intended to be modified, and path is already const-qualified. A true violation would be if a pointer to a const-qualified object were cast to a non-const pointer (e.g., casting a const char * to (void *) and then using it to modify the pointee), which is not happening in this fragment."
