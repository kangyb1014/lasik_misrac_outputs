Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether any of the controlling expressions in lfs_alloc are invariant (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know which variables/expressions can change while a loop is executing and which cannot. The listed symbols are required for that reasoning:\n\n- lfs_t (definition): The function indexes fields through the lfs pointer. Knowing the full structure is required to see types and whether fields are part of the same object, their signedness/width, and possible aliasing.\n\n- lfs->lookahead (lookahead sub-struct definition and field types): The controlling expressions reference lookahead.next, lookahead.size, lookahead.ckpoint, lookahead.start, and lookahead.buffer. You must know each field's type and layout to determine (a) whether increments/assignments in the function actually change the controlling expressions, (b) wrap/overflow semantics, and (c) whether any field is declared volatile/atomic (affects invariance reasoning).\n\n- lfs_block_t (typedef): The function writes to *block; the analyzer needs the type to reason about aliasing/updates that might affect lookahead fields or other loop controls (and to check side effects if block aliases lookahead memory).\n\n- lfs->block_count (type and mutability): Used in the computed block value (modulo operation). Its type and whether it can change (e.g., modified by other functions) affect whether that expression can be considered invariant.\n\n- lfs_alloc_scan: The function is invoked from inside lfs_alloc when the lookahead buffer is exhausted. lfs_alloc_scan may update lookahead.start/size/ckpoint/buffer (and thus change the controlling expressions of subsequent loops). You must inspect its implementation/semantics to determine whether the outer/inner loops' controlling expressions can change across iterations or are invariant.\n\n- lfs_alloc_drop: Called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_alloc_scan in the call graph. It may modify lookahead state or buffer contents that the loops test; include it to see side effects that affect invariance.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: Also called by lfs_alloc_scan; it likely inspects/traverses filesystem blocks and may set/clear bits in lookahead.buffer. Its behavior determines whether buffer bit tests inside the loops can change as the scan proceeds.\n\n- lfs_min: A helper called by lfs_alloc_scan; include to fully understand any size/limit computations that lfs_alloc_scan uses to update lookahead.size or related fields.\n\n- definitions/qualifiers of lookahead fields and buffer element type (e.g., uint8_t*): You need to know whether buffer elements are plain memory, volatile, or can be modified concurrently/indirectly (aliasing), and the underlying integer width to reason about bit-shift and mask operations in the controlling expressions.\n\nNotes: LFS_ERROR and LFS_ERR_NOSPC are not relevant to whether controlling expressions are invariant (they affect diagnostics/return values only). The callers of lfs_alloc are not required to assess invariance inside lfs_alloc, except insofar as they might alias or concurrently modify lfs state; if the codebase has concurrent access, include synchronization/aliasing specs as well."
