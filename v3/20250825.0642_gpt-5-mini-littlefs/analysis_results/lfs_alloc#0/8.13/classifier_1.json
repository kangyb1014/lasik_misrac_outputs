  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Violation if lfs->lookahead.buffer is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. uint8_t *buffer) but is only read here. In the fragment the code only reads from lookahead.buffer (no writes), so according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer type should be const (e.g. const uint8_t *buffer). If, however, lookahead.buffer is mutated elsewhere (written to), then making it const is not possible and there is no violation."
