  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 14.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe for loop uses a loop counter id (first and third clauses are fine) but its second clause is id < dir.count. Functions called in the loop body (notably lfs_dir_get(lfs, &dir, ...), and potentially lfs_ctz_traverse or the cb callback) are passed &dir or could otherwise modify the dir object. If any of these calls modify dir.count (or dir) during the loop body, the loop condition depends on an object that is modified in the body, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. For example, if lfs_dir_get updates dir.count, the second clause uses an object that is modified in the loop body, so the rule is violated.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_alloc code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/4.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_alloc as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_alloc:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_alloc(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_block_t *block) {\n    while (true) {\n        // scan our lookahead buffer for free blocks\n        while (lfs->lookahead.next < lfs->lookahead.size) {\n            if (!(lfs->lookahead.buffer[lfs->lookahead.next / 8]\n                    & (1U << (lfs->lookahead.next % 8)))) {\n                // found a free block\n                *block = (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next)\n                        % lfs->block_count;\n\n                // eagerly find next free block to maximize how many blocks\n                // lfs_alloc_ckpoint makes available for scanning\n                while (true) {\n                    lfs->lookahead.next += 1;\n                    lfs->lookahead.ckpoint -= 1;\n\n                    if (lfs->lookahead.next >= lfs->lookahead.size\n                            || !(lfs->lookahead.buffer[lfs->lookahead.next / 8]\n                                & (1U << (lfs->lookahead.next % 8)))) {\n                        return 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            lfs->lookahead.next += 1;\n            lfs->lookahead.ckpoint -= 1;\n        }\n\n        // In order to keep our block allocator from spinning forever when our\n        // filesystem is full, we mark points where there are no in-flight\n        // allocations with a checkpoint before starting a set of allocations.\n        //\n        // If we've looked at all blocks since the last checkpoint, we report\n        // the filesystem as out of storage.\n        //\n        if (lfs->lookahead.ckpoint <= 0) {\n            LFS_ERROR(\"No more free space 0x%\"PRIx32,\n                    (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next)\n                        % lfs->block_count);\n            return LFS_ERR_NOSPC;\n        }\n\n        // No blocks in our lookahead buffer, we need to scan the filesystem for\n        // unused blocks in the next lookahead window.\n        int err = lfs_alloc_scan(lfs);\n        if(err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_alloc code.\n",
