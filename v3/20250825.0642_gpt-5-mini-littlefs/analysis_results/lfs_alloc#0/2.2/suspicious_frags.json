  "explanation": "I found no operations that appear to be dead code. Every assignment and side-effect in lfs_alloc is observable or can affect subsequent behaviour:\n\n- The assignment to *block is the function\u2019s primary output; removing it would change behaviour.\n- The increments of lfs->lookahead.next and decrements of lfs->lookahead.ckpoint (both inside the main scan loop and inside the eager inner loop) update allocator state used by subsequent iterations and by the ckpoint check (if removed, allocator progress and out-of-space detection would change).\n- The bit tests on lfs->lookahead.buffer determine control flow (finding a free block) and are not removable.\n- The inner eager while(true) loop updates state to \u201cpre-find\u201d the next free block; its early return and state updates affect later scanning/allocations.\n- The LFS_ERROR(...) call produces an observable diagnostic side-effect and the following return LFS_ERR_NOSPC is required to signal the error; removing these would alter program behaviour.\n- The call to lfs_alloc_scan(lfs) and its error handling are required to progress the lookahead window and to propagate errors; they are not dead.\n- There is no unreachable code in the function (all loops either return or continue depending on runtime conditions), so nothing falls under the separate category of unreachable code (which per the rule note is not considered dead code).\n\nGiven the above, I do not identify any code fragment in lfs_alloc that is executed yet removable without affecting program behaviour; therefore no fragments are reported for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
