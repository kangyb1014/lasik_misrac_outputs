  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not change program behaviour (i.e. dead code). The statement LFS_ASSERT((bool)0x80000000) evaluates a constant expression that is always true on any conforming C implementation that provides _Bool, and the assert handler is only invoked on failure. In other words the evaluation has no observable effect at runtime in a conforming build (the assert cannot fail), so removing that assertion would not change program behaviour \u2014 it therefore meets the definition of dead code and falls afoul of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Caveat: if the LFS_ASSERT macro has observable side effects even when the condition is true (for example it logs every check or otherwise alters program state), then the statement would not be dead; given the provided execution log and the usual semantics of assert-like macros, there are no such side effects here, so the agent A report is correct."
