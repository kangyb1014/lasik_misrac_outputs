  "explanation": "I flagged every controlling expression (all if/else-if/if statements) in the function because MISRA C Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions. There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) in this function, and none of the other non-control statements (variable declarations, assignments, casts, comments, function calls, or return statements) are relevant to Rule 14.3, so they were not included. The listed fragments cover all points where execution is selected by a controlling expression; other code lines are either simple data operations or function calls and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 14.3. The rule exceptions for deliberately invariant infinite loops or a do-while with a constant-false controlling expression do not apply in this function."
