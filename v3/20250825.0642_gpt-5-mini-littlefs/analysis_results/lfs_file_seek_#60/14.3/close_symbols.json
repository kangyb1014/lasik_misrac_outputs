  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d we must determine whether each conditional expression in lfs_file_seek_ can ever be a compile-time or effectively invariant (constant) controlling expression. Each listed symbol is necessary to decide that:\n\n- LFS_SEEK_SET, LFS_SEEK_CUR, LFS_SEEK_END: these constants are used in the whence comparisons. If any are defined in a way that makes the comparisons constant (e.g. equal to each other or to a single value), the controlling expressions could be invariant.\n\n- LFS_ERR_INVAL: used as a returned error code when npos > lfs->file_max. Knowing its definition is needed to reason about whether an early return is a constant branch target (less critical but relevant for understanding control flow semantics).\n\n- LFS_F_READING: the flag mask used in (file->flags & LFS_F_READING). If this macro is zero or otherwise causes the expression to be identically false/true for all possible file->flags, the combined controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- lfs_t (struct) and member file_max: the test npos > lfs->file_max depends on file_max. We need the type and typical mutability/initialization of file_max (and whether it can be a compile-time constant) to decide if the comparison can be invariant.\n\n- struct pointed to by lfs->cfg (e.g. lfs_config) and member block_size: the condition file->off != lfs->cfg->block_size depends on cfg->block_size. If block_size is a compile-time constant macro or fixed immutable value, that might make the comparison invariant for all calls; we need its definition.\n\n- lfs_file_t (struct) and members pos, off, flags, cache.off, cache.size: many controlling expressions refer to these members (file->pos == npos, file->off != ..., file->cache.off, file->cache.size). Knowing their types and whether they can change or are initialized to invariant values is required to judge if the tests are non-invariant.\n\n- lfs_off_t and lfs_soff_t typedefs: used for types of npos, off and return type; needed to understand ranges, signedness and whether certain comparisons / casts can fold to constants.\n\n- lfs_ctz_index (declaration/semantics): oindex and nindex are computed by calls to lfs_ctz_index inside the conditional. To decide whether the controlling comparison (oindex == nindex && ...) is invariant we must know the prototype, whether it mutates its lfs_off_t* argument, and whether it can return a non-varying value for the passed inputs.\n\n- lfs_file_size_ (declaration/semantics): used when whence == LFS_SEEK_END to compute npos. We must know if lfs_file_size_ can return a constant value (or has side effects) that would make the branch/condition behavior invariant.\n\n- lfs_file_flush (declaration/semantics): its return value is tested (if (err)). To determine if that controlling expression could be invariant (always false/true) we need its specification/implementation (or at least documentation of possible return values).\n\nIn short: the rule requires proving that each controlling expression is not an invariant. That proof needs the definitions of the constants used in comparisons, the types and mutable members read by the expressions, and the callees whose return values feed those expressions."
