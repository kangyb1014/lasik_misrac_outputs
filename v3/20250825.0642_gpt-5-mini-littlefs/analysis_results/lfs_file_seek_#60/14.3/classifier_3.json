  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expressions (whence == LFS_SEEK_SET, whence == LFS_SEEK_CUR, whence == LFS_SEEK_END) depend on the function parameter 'whence' so they are not invariant. A violation would occur if a controlling expression were a compile-time constant (for example if it were 'if (1)' or if 'whence' were a constant macro), which is not the case here."
