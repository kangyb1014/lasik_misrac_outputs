True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code passes the address of a non-const local (lfs_off_t noff) to lfs_ctz_index via &noff. If lfs_ctz_index only reads the value (as implied by usage, e.g. also called with &(lfs_off_t){file->pos}), its parameter should be a pointer-to-const (const lfs_off_t *). As written this passes a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer would be sufficient, violating Rule 8.13. Change the callee signature to accept const lfs_off_t * (and update calls) to comply.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s concern is plausible but not provable from the snippet alone. MISRA 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer parameter should be const-qualified if the pointed-to object is not modified. In this function we only see calls lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){file->pos}) and lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &noff). Whether there is a MISRA violation depends on the declaration/implementation of lfs_ctz_index. If lfs_ctz_index is currently declared as taking lfs_off_t * but only reads the value, then that declaration should be changed to const lfs_off_t * and the agent\u2019s report is correct. If lfs_ctz_index legitimately modifies the pointed value, then the current signature is appropriate and there is no violation. Thus the provided evidence is insufficient to conclude a definite violation \u2014 you must inspect the lfs_ctz_index prototype/definition to decide. As a remediation: if ctz does not modify the argument, change its parameter to const lfs_off_t * (call sites are compatible via implicit conversion)."
