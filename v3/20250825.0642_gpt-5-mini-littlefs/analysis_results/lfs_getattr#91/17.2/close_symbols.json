  "explanation": "You must inspect the transitive call graph starting at lfs_getattr to prove absence of direct or indirect self-calls. Specifically:\n- lfs_getattr_: direct callee of lfs_getattr; its body must be inspected for any call back to lfs_getattr (direct recursion) or calls that eventually lead back (indirect recursion).\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_min, lfs_tag_size: direct callees of lfs_getattr_. Each of these functions (and their transitive callees) must be examined to ensure none call lfs_getattr or lfs_getattr_ (which would create indirect recursion).\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: these are invoked in lfs_getattr (macros or wrapper functions). If they expand to or call functions, those functions must be checked as well for any path back to lfs_getattr or lfs_getattr_.\nIn short, to verify MISRA rule (no direct or indirect self-calls) you need the definitions of lfs_getattr_ and all functions it calls (and their callees), plus any functions invoked by the lock/trace macros, so you can prove there is no path that returns to lfs_getattr or lfs_getattr_."
