  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is: Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\nHere are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 14.3.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe controlling expression is invariant because err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), and LFS_LOCK is defined as ((void)cfg,0). Thus err is always 0 and the test if (err) is always false (invariant). This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The listed exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the specific do-while false constant exception) do not apply here.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_getattr code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/915.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_getattr as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_getattr:\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_getattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_getattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_getattr_(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_getattr -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_getattr code.\n",
