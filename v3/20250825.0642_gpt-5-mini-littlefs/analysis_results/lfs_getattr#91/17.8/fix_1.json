  "explanation": "The original snippet was truncated inside fprintf. I completed the lfs_probe_log implementation: finished the format string using the PRId32 macro for printing int32_t, added a safe 32-character snapshot of the path, and closed the file with fclose. I also provided a minimal, compilable lfs_getattr function that preserves the original structure (input validation, result code, and probe logging at entry/exit) so the code compiles and is executable without adding main(), macros, or mock functions."
