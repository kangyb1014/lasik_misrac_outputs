In the provided project LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) expands to ((void)cfg), which performs no action or side-effect. The call is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although LFS_UNLOCK expands to ((void)cfg) in the posted configuration (i.e. it is a no-op in terms of producing a value or performing a visible state change), that does not automatically make the statement \"dead code\" under MISRA 2.2 for the following reasons:\n\n- MISRA Note 1 explicitly calls out that timing can be part of observable behaviour in embedded systems. Removing an executed statement can change timing and therefore may change program behaviour. You cannot assume removal has no effect solely because the expansion does not write state.\n\n- The expression ((void)cfg) still accesses the operand syntactically (the member access lfs->cfg is evaluated). If cfg were volatile or its evaluation has side-effects in some build, the expression is not removable. Even if cfg is non-volatile in the current build, the macro is commonly used to keep a stable API across builds; other builds/configurations may define LFS_UNLOCK to perform real unlocking, so the source must remain.\n\n- MISRA Rule 2.2 applies to the whole project as built. The presence of a macro that is a no-op in one configuration but performs work in another is a normal, acceptable pattern; the call is not necessarily dead code in the project context. Also ((void)x) is a standard idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings and is not generally treated as a violation on its own.\n\nIf, in a concrete review of a single final build of the project you can prove that removing the LFS_UNLOCK call neither (a) changes timing in any way that matters for the system, (b) removes any side-effect (e.g. volatile reads), nor (c) affects other observable behaviour, then it could be considered dead code in that very specific build. Based on the information provided (macro, trace logs, and typical intent), the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not justified."
