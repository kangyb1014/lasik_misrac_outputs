  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function. Each construct is standard C:\n- The function is declared with standard storage-class specifier 'static'.\n- Local variable declaration 'int err = ...' is standard C (C99 and later allow declarations within blocks); this is not a compiler extension.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or builtins (for example, no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or pragmas).\n- Bitwise operations and macro usage (e.g. LFS_F_INLINE) are standard C; the identifier LFS_F_INLINE is a macro/constant name, not the language 'inline' specifier.\n- No inline assembly, no platform-specific pointer casts, no variable-length arrays, and no other documented compiler extensions appear.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
