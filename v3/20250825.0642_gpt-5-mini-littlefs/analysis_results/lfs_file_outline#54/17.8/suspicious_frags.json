  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the pointer parameters themselves. The statements file->off = file->pos; and file->flags &= ~LFS_F_INLINE; modify the objects pointed to by the parameter file, which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The calls lfs_alloc_ckpoint(lfs) and lfs_file_relocate(lfs, file) pass the pointer parameters but do not reassign the parameter variables in this function. There are no assignments to lfs or file (the pointer variables) and no rebinds of those parameters, so no fragments here violate the rule."
