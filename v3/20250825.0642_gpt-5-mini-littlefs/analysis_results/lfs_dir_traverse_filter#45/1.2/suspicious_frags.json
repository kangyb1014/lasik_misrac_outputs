  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. I inspected for common compiler-specific extensions and constructs and found none of the following: __attribute__ or __declspec, __asm__/asm statements or inline assembly, typeof (GCC extension), statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions (GCC), label-as-value (&&label), compiler builtins or __builtin_ identifiers, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or other vendor-specific keywords. The code uses standard C features: static/inline functions (C99), stdint types (uint32_t/int32_t), the bool/true/false Boolean type (C99 stdbool), // comments (C99), void* to typed pointer assignment (standard C), and ordinary macros and bit-shifts. Note: there is an implementation-defined signed right-shift in lfs_tag_isdelete (shifting a signed value right), but that is implementation-defined behavior, not a compiler language extension; it should be reviewed for portability but does not violate Rule 1.2 (language extensions). Therefore there are no fragments to report under Rule 1.2."
