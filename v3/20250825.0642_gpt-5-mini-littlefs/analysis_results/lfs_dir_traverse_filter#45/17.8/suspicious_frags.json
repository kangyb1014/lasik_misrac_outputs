  "explanation": "Other fragments do not modify function parameters themselves. The local pointer initialization (lfs_tag_t *filtertag = p;) only creates a local pointer and does not assign to the parameter variable p. The scalar parameter tag is only read (bitwise ops, comparisons, and being passed to helper functions) and never assigned to. The buffer parameter is explicitly unused via (void)buffer. All other operations create or use local variables (e.g., mask) or perform reads; therefore they do not violate Rule 17.8, which disallows modifying the parameter object itself (the pointer value or non\u2011pointer parameter). The two listed fragments write through the pointer parameter (modify the object pointed to), which is allowed by the Rule in principle but should be reviewed to ensure the intended semantics and that the pointer parameter itself is not reassigned elsewhere."
