  "explanation": "You must inspect any macros or inlined symbols that appear in the target function because MISRA\u2019s rule concerns modification of the function parameter identifiers inside the function body \u2014 and macros expand inline and can contain assignments to those identifiers. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or inline function call in the function prologue (err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to or rebinds local identifiers (including the parameter variable or expressions involving it). Provide its definition to confirm it does not modify the parameter variable 'lfs' (or the expression 'lfs->cfg') itself.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK. It is invoked at the end (LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);). Inspect its definition to ensure it does not perform assignments that modify the parameter variable 'lfs' or rebind 'lfs->cfg'.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is invoked twice and uses the parameter identifiers (lfs, cb, data) as arguments. Macros with variadic/formatting behavior can expand into code that mutates their arguments or introduce temporary assignments. Provide its definition to confirm it does not modify the parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: Although shown as a callee, confirm whether it is an ordinary function or a macro/inline function. If it is a macro it could expand at the call site and modify the local parameter identifiers. If it is a normal function, it cannot reassign the caller\u2019s parameter variables, but you should still supply its declaration/definition to verify its nature.\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition): The function uses the parameter lfs and the member lfs->cfg. Provide the lfs_t structure definition so that any macro expansions (LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK) that reference members can be interpreted correctly and to confirm that accessing lfs->cfg does not hide any macro that modifies the parameter identifier.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg/member type): Because LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg, include the cfg type definition to inspect how the macros/functions operate on that argument and whether macro expansion could produce assignments that affect the parameter variable 'lfs'.\n\n(You generally do not need standard typedefs like uintptr_t or the cb signature itself to check whether the parameter identifiers are reassigned; the critical pieces are macro/inline definitions and the lfs_t/cfg definitions that could appear in those expansions.)"
