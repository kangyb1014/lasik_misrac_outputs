  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_traverse (or anything it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect the implementation of lfs_fs_traverse_ (the direct callee) and all functions it calls (per the static call graph) because any of them might call memcmp or otherwise perform string comparisons. The listed symbols are needed for these reasons:\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: The direct implementation called by lfs_fs_traverse; must be examined for any use of memcmp or passing of string pointers to callees.\n- lfs_pair_isnull: Callee of lfs_fs_traverse_; may perform comparisons (including memcmp) on data that could be NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n- lfs_tortoise_detectcycles: Callee; cycle detection routines sometimes compare values \u2014 must be checked for memcmp use.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Callee; directory fetch code often deals with names/strings and could use memcmp/strncmp/strcmp.\n- lfs_dir_get: Callee; likely inspects directory entries / names and is a high\u2011risk site for memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n- lfs_ctz_fromle32: Callee; included because it is called by lfs_fs_traverse_ and must be checked even if unlikely to use memcmp.\n- lfs_tag_type3: Callee; tag parsing may compare byte sequences \u2014 needs inspection for memcmp usage.\n- lfs_ctz_traverse: Callee; traversal helpers may perform comparisons and should be inspected.\n- memcmp: The standard library symbol itself (and its prototype) must be considered so the analyzer can identify direct calls and determine whether the arguments are pointers into NUL\u2011terminated strings (the MISRA violation condition).\n\nIf any of the above functions contain calls to memcmp (or macros expanding to memcmp) where one or both arguments are pointers to NUL\u2011terminated strings, that would indicate a potential MISRA violation. Inspecting these symbols lets the next agent trace argument origins and types to decide compliance."
