  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule about language extensions you must examine any macro or type/identifier used by the target function that could hide compiler-specific extensions. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: macro/inline function could use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, __attribute__, asm, builtin intrinsics). Need its definition to determine if an extension is used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (may hide extensions in its implementation).\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro is the most likely place to use variadic macros, GCC/clang extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, __attribute__((format)), __builtin_* or __VA_OPT__/##__VA_ARGS__ tricks). Its definition is required to determine whether any non\u2011standard extension is used.\n- lfs_t: the type of the first parameter may itself be declared with compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit\u2011field extensions, anonymous structs/unions, __extension__ markers). Need its definition to check for extensions.\n- lfs_block_t: type used in the callback signature; its underlying typedef could use non\u2011standard integer types or attributes (e.g. wider integer via compiler extension). Inspecting it is necessary.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: the called function\u2019s prototype/definition should be checked because attributes on the function (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn)), calling\u2011convention attributes) or use of extensions in its declaration could propagate non\u2011standard usage into the call site analysis.\n- uintptr_t: the code casts the callback to (void*)(uintptr_t)cb \u2014 uintptr_t is a standard C99 type if <stdint.h> is used, but could be provided as an implementation extension. You must confirm its origin/definition to ensure no extension is involved.\n- true: the literal 'true' (used as a parameter) may come from <stdbool.h> or a custom macro; verify its definition to ensure no extension or non\u2011standard macro is used.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next agent inspect all macros, typedefs and declarations that could hide compiler-specific extensions. Only after examining these definitions can one determine whether the target function itself (including the casts and macro uses) relies on language extensions."
