  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), which is not a standard <string.h> function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, memset, etc.). This line does not invoke any of those functions, so it does not by itself cause a Rule 21.17 breach. (Note: if the LFS_LOCK macro/function expands to or calls a string.h routine that misuses pointer bounds, that expansion would need separate review.)"
