  "scenario": "No. The fragment itself does not call any functions from <string.h> and does not perform any buffer copies \u2014 it merely passes a format string and pointer arguments to the LFS_TRACE macro. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated by this code fragment as written. A specific violation scenario would be if LFS_TRACE were implemented unsafely using <string.h> routines to assemble the log into a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking (for example: char buf[16]; strcpy(buf, formatted_message); or using memcpy/strcat with incorrect sizes), which could result in out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses and would violate Rule 21.17."
