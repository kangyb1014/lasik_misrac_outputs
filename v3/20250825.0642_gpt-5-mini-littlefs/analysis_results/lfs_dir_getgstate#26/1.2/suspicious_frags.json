  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. I checked for common vendor/extension constructs that are explicitly reported as extensions in compiler documentation, including: __attribute__ / __declspec, __builtin_* or __sync_* intrinsics, inline assembler (asm), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }) used as expressions, nested functions, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, GCC/Clang __extension__ markers, and other non\u2011standard keywords. The code uses standard C constructs and standard integer types (uint32_t, int32_t), standard boolean (bool), normal function definitions, macros, array members, and preprocessor conditionals. The LFS_MKTAG macro uses plain casts and bit shifts (standard C), and the // single-line comments and C99 types are standard in modern C (not compiler-specific extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that, based on the provided sources, require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
