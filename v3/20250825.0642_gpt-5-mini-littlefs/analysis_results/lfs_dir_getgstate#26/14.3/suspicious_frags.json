  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions found. The only control expressions are: (1) if (res < 0 && res != LFS_ERR_NOENT) and (2) if (res != LFS_ERR_NOENT). Both depend on the variable res which is assigned the return value of lfs_dir_get(...) immediately before; therefore their values are not compile-time or program-invariant and must be evaluated at runtime. There are no loops or other conditional constructs with constant/always-true/always-false conditions in the provided code. The constant tags passed to lfs_dir_get are arguments, not controlling expressions. Consequently, there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the shown code."
