  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about pointer declarations: a pointer type should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. The code shown for lfs_dir_getgstate does not itself declare any pointer that should be const; it simply passes &temp to lfs_gstate_xor. If lfs_gstate_xor really does not modify its second-argument pointee, then the violation is in the declaration of lfs_gstate_xor (its second parameter should be const lfs_gstate_t *src). If, however, lfs_gstate_xor legitimately modifies that argument, then the non-const parameter is correct and there is no violation. The execution log shows temp is not modified by lfs_gstate_xor, which suggests the xor function could accept a const pointer, but that is a defect in lfs_gstate_xor\u2019s prototype, not in lfs_dir_getgstate itself. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim that lfs_dir_getgstate violates Rule 8.13 is not correct (the potential violation would be in lfs_gstate_xor\u2019s declaration)."
