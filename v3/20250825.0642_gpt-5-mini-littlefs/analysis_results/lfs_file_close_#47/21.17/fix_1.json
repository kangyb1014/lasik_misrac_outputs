  "explanation": "The compile errors were caused by references to file->cfg->cache_size, but the struct lfs_file_config in this build does not have that member. To fix the compile errors without changing the surrounding logic, I removed references to that non-existent member. The first diagnostic fprintf now logs 0 for cfg_cache_size (with a comment explaining why), and I removed the conditional block that compared file->ctz.size against cfg->cache_size to avoid referencing the missing member. All other logic and logging were preserved."
