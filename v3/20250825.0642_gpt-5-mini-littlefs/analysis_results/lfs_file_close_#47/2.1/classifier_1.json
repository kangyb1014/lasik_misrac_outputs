  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement is conditionally compiled with #ifndef LFS_READONLY. When LFS_READONLY is not defined the statement int err = lfs_file_sync_(lfs, file); is present in the translation unit and is reachable at runtime; when LFS_READONLY is defined that statement is not compiled (so it is not unreachable code present in the project). A Rule 2.1 violation would only occur if the statement were present in the compiled translation unit but could never be executed (for example code after an unconditional return, or inside an if (0) block), which is not the case here."
