  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. In this fragment file->cache.buffer is being freed (lfs_free takes a void *), so the buffer must be a modifiable object and cannot reasonably be const. The surrounding check (if (!file->cfg->buffer)) indicates that an external buffer in cfg is not present, so the implementation frees its internal cache buffer. Rule 8.13 would only be violated if a pointer was declared non-const even though the pointed data is never modified; there is no evidence here of that. (A hypothetical violation would occur if file->cache.buffer were declared as a non-const pointer but the code never modified the pointee \u2014 or conversely if a const-qualified buffer were cast away to call lfs_free.)"
