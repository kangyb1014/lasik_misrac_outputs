  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: the code only reads an integer member (lfs->cfg->lookahead_size) and assigns a computed value to lfs->lookahead.size. There is no pointer declaration or pointer-to-pointer usage here that should be const-qualified. To determine any real Rule 8.13 issue you would need to inspect the declaration of lfs->cfg (e.g. whether it could be const lfs_config_t *). If lfs->cfg is never modified, consider making it a pointer-to-const, but the shown line itself does not violate Rule 8.13."
