  "explanation": "Other code fragments in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they clearly modify data or are simple control-flow statements, so the pointer types are intentionally mutable: the assignments to lfs->lookahead.start and lfs->lookahead.next modify members of the object (so lfs cannot be a pointer-to-const here), the call to lfs_alloc_drop(lfs) is passing the same modifiable object for cleanup, and the final return/if/error handling are control-flow only. The comments and simple arithmetic using lfs->block_count are not pointer-declaration issues. Therefore only the three fragments above \u2014 which involve reading from lfs->cfg (a nested pointer/member used only for read operations) and passing lfs and a callback to another function \u2014 warrant further inspection to determine whether any pointers (e.g. cfg or callback/context parameter types) could/should be const-qualified per MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
