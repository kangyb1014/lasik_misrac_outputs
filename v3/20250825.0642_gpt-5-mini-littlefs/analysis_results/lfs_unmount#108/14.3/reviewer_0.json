The controlling expression if (err) is therefore an invariant (constant false) expression, which is not one of the permitted exceptions for Rule 14.3 (the exceptions only allow invariants for infinite loops or a do-while false constant).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_unmount:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the translation unit shown LFS_LOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg,0) so err is initialized to the constant 0 and the controlling expression if (err) is therefore invariant (always false). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions except for the two narrow exceptions (infinite loops and the specific do-while false case), neither of which applies to an if statement. (One caveat: if LFS_LOCK is intentionally redefined in other translation units, the rule must be assessed per translation unit; given the provided macro definition the code in this TU violates Rule 14.3.)"
