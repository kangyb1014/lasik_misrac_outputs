  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in lfs_unmount is provably unreachable, the analyser must know the actual control-flow and return/non\u2011return behaviour of called macros/functions and the callee(s):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is used in the initial call and its result controls the early return. If LFS_LOCK is a macro or function that always returns a particular value, never returns, loops forever, or performs a longjmp/exit, that would make subsequent code unreachable. You must inspect its definition/semantics.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called just before returning; its definition could influence control flow (e.g. non-returning behavior, longjmp, abort). Ensure it does not make later code unreachable or insert hidden returns.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros can expand to complex code (including conditionally compiled returns, asserts aborting, or longjmps). Its expansion must be checked for non\u2011local control flow that could make following statements unreachable.\n\n- lfs_unmount_: The direct callee; it could itself not return (e.g. call exit/longjmp) or always set err to a fixed value causing a deterministic branch outcome. Its body is required to determine reachability of the lines after its call.\n\n- lfs_deinit: lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit (per the call graph). If lfs_deinit or other downstream callees perform non\u2011local control flow, that can make code after lfs_unmount_ unreachable; thus their definitions should be examined.\n\n- lfs_t (struct definition, including the type of its cfg member): The type of lfs (and its cfg member) is needed because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; macro expansions or inline functions may reference fields or function pointers in the cfg that affect control flow. Knowing the structure lets you resolve how the lock/unlock calls are dispatched.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the config/ops structure used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK): If LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK dispatch via function pointers in cfg, you must resolve those targets to know if they can return normally.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser determine whether the early return always happens, whether any called routine never returns, or whether macros expand to constructs that render code unreachable \u2014 all necessary to check MISRA's \"no unreachable code\" requirement for lfs_unmount."
