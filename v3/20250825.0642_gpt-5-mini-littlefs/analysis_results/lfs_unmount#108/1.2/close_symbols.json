  "explanation": "LFS_LOCK: The call in the target function is a macro or wrapper; its definition must be inspected because macros can hide compiler-specific language extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline assembly, __attribute__, __builtin_* usage). Any such extension in LFS_LOCK would make the target function effectively use a language extension.\n\nLFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock operation may be a macro or inline wrapper that uses compiler-specific extensions. Inspecting its definition is required to determine if the target function relies on an extension.\n\nLFS_TRACE: This is almost certainly a macro (logging/trace) and frequently implemented with variadic macros, GCC/Clang token-pasting tricks (##__VA_ARGS__), __attribute__((format(...))) or other compiler builtins. The exact macro expansion must be checked for compiler-specific extensions that would make the target function violate the MISRA rule.\n\nlfs_unmount_: Although it is only called, its declaration/definition should be checked if it is an inline function or macro that uses extensions (attributes, inline-assembly, statement-expressions, typeof, etc.). If the callee is implemented using an extension, the call from lfs_unmount means the target function depends on that extension.\n\nlfs_t: The type definition of lfs_t must be inspected for use of language extensions in its declaration (anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific bitfield extensions, attributes on the type, flexible-array usage that may rely on extensions, or other non-standard constructs) because accessing members (lfs->cfg) could be affected.\n\ntype of lfs->cfg (configuration object): The actual type of the cfg member (e.g. lfs_cfg_t or similar) must be examined for any language extensions in its definition (attributes, compiler-specific qualifiers, anonymous members, etc.) because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg and any extension in that type or in operations on it could make the target function use an extension.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to expand macros and inspect types used directly by lfs_unmount to determine whether any compiler-documented language extensions are used in code that the target function depends on."
