  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (e.g. the local integer declaration/initialization combining with the LFS_LOCK call, the final trace that prints the integer error value, the return statement, and the closing brace) do not involve pointer types or casting that would be affected by recommending additional const qualifications. Statements that only handle non-pointer scalars (err, return err) or formatting of non-pointer values do not bear on Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need further investigation. The listed fragments are those in this function that reference pointer objects or perform a cast that could be affected by adding const qualifiers and thus should be examined."
