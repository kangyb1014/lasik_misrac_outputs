  "scenario": "No violation shown in this fragment. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when the pointee is not modified. Calling lfs_unmount_(lfs) with a non-const lfs_t * is appropriate if the unmount operation modifies the lfs object. This fragment does not show a breach. A violation would occur if the prototype/definition of lfs_unmount_ were int lfs_unmount_(lfs_t *lfs) but the function only reads from *lfs (in which case it should accept const lfs_t *), or if the caller unnecessarily uses a non-const pointer when only read access is required."
