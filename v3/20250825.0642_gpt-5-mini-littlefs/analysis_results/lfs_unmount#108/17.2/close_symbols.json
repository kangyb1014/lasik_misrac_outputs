  "explanation": "- lfs_unmount_: directly called by the target (lfs_unmount). Must be inspected to see whether it (or anything it calls) calls back to lfs_unmount (directly or indirectly).\n- lfs_deinit: called by lfs_unmount_. If lfs_deinit calls lfs_unmount or calls other functions that eventually call lfs_unmount, that would create an indirect recursion; therefore its body and its callees must be analyzed.\n- lfs_mount_: appears in the static graph as a caller of lfs_unmount_. Although not directly invoked here, it can participate in cycles (e.g., lfs_unmount -> lfs_unmount_ -> lfs_deinit -> lfs_mount_ -> lfs_unmount). To rule out indirect recursion you must inspect lfs_mount_ and any functions it calls. \n\nNote: to fully determine compliance with the MISRA rule you should examine the full transitive call graph of these symbols (i.e., all functions called by lfs_unmount_, lfs_deinit, and lfs_mount_) to detect any path that returns to lfs_unmount (directly or indirectly)."
