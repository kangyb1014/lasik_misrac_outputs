  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The fragment calls lfs_free(lfs->pcache.buffer), which is a deallocation call and does not invoke any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Therefore, based on the shown code there is no direct use of string.h functions and no violation of Rule 21.17. (If lfs_free\u2019s implementation internally used a <string.h> routine incorrectly, that internal use would need separate review, but nothing in the provided fragment violates Rule 21.17.)"
