  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code fragments (lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_alloc, lfs_alloc_scan, lfs_bd_read and related helpers). There are no calls to the standard library function memcmp anywhere in these fragments. The code uses memcpy and memset, and performs integer/offset checks, but it does not perform any comparisons of null-terminated strings via memcmp. Because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and no memcmp usage is present in the supplied code, there are no suspicious fragments to report. If there are other source files or symbols not included here, please provide them so they can be checked for memcmp usage."
