  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The following points explain why other fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions):\n\n- Declaration in the for-loop (for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)): This is a standard C99 feature (block-scoped declaration) and is not a compiler-specific extension.\n- Use of // single-line comments: These are part of standard C99 and later, not an extension.\n- Use of bool, true, false: These are standard since C99 via _Bool and stdbool.h; their use is not a compiler extension (assuming standard headers are used in the project).\n- Type casts and constant macro LFS_BLOCK_NULL ((lfs_block_t)-1): Standard C cast usage, not an extension.\n- Bitwise and arithmetic operations (e.g., ((lfs->cfg->block_cycles+1)|1), lfs_alignup, etc.): Plain standard C expressions.\n- Pointer usage, struct and typedef declarations, conditional compilation (#ifdef LFS_MIGRATE): All are standard preprocessor and language features.\n\nNo constructs such as compiler-specific keywords or attributes (e.g., __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__), inline assembly, nonstandard calling conventions, variable-length arrays used as GCC/clang extensions, Microsoft-specific extensions, or other documented compiler-only extensions are present in the snippets provided. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for potential use of language extensions under Rule 1.2."
