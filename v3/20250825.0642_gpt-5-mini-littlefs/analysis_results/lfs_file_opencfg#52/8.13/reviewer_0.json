To conform, the member should be declared with a const-qualified pointee (for example: const void *buffer) or otherwise ensure the pointer type is const where possible. If, instead, 'buffer' is already declared as a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *buffer), there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations \u2014 pointers should be declared to point to const-qualified pointees where appropriate. In the snippet shown, the function parameter cfg is declared as const struct lfs_file_config *cfg, so the function is not declaring any non-const pointer to the configuration object. Accessing cfg->buffer is a use of a member of a const-qualified object, not a new pointer declaration in this function. If the struct member itself were declared as void *buffer (non-const), that would be a concern in the struct definition (the member declaration might be non-conforming if the pointer could and should be to const), but that is not a violation introduced by the code shown here. Conversely, if the member is declared as const void *buffer then there is clearly no issue. In short: the potential violation would be in the lfs_file_config member declaration, not in this call-site; therefore the agent A claim that this function as shown violates Rule 8.13 is not correct."
