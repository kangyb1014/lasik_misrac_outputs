  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C pointer const-qualification you must know the exact declarations and prototypes that determine whether const is required, preserved, or deliberately discarded:\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): shows the types of lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist fields. Knowing these field types is necessary to see whether pointers passed into LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, and lfs_mlist_isopen should be const-qualified.\n\n- lfs_file_t (type/struct definition): establishes the true type of the 'file' parameter and whether it should be const in calls or casts (the code casts it to struct lfs_mlist*). This affects whether any cast discards const.\n\n- struct lfs_file_config (definition): contains the declarations of buffer, attrs, attr_count and their pointer qualifications. The function takes 'const struct lfs_file_config *cfg' \u2014 you must confirm the field types to see if any further const qualification is possible or if fields are non-const pointers.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): needed because the code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*) and calls lfs_mlist_isopen; you must inspect whether lfs_mlist_isopen expects a const pointer or not to determine if the cast/usage discards const.\n\n- lfs_file_opencfg_ (declaration/prototype): the target forwards cfg to this helper. If lfs_file_opencfg_ takes a non-const struct lfs_file_config*, passing a const pointer from this function would be a const-discarding conversion and relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/prototype): the function is called with (lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file). Its parameter const-qualification determines whether the cast/usage removes constness and thus whether the call violates the rule.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function signature): the code explicitly casts (void*)cfg when calling LFS_TRACE. You must inspect the LFS_TRACE signature to see whether it requires non-const pointers or forces casts; the explicit cast here is a potential const-discard and must be judged against MISRA.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function signatures): these are invoked with lfs->cfg. Knowing their expected parameter types (const or non-const) and whether they perform casts is necessary to determine if any const qualification is discarded.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT (macro/function signature): used with lfs_mlist_isopen; while usually a diagnostic, its signature could force casts or take non-const pointers. Include to ensure no implicit const-discarding occurs inside the assertion macro.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine where const is declared, where const pointers are passed to functions expecting non-const, and where explicit casts (e.g., (void*)cfg) remove const qualification \u2014 all needed to decide compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer types."
