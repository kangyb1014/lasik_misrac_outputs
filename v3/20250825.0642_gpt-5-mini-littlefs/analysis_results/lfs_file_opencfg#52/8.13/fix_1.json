  "explanation": "I removed the duplicate definition of struct lfs_mlist (it was already defined in lfs.h), which caused many member-related errors. I also renamed the helper macros/functions LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_ASSERT, and LFS_TRACE to lfs_lock_probe, lfs_unlock_probe, probe_assert, and lfs_trace_probe to avoid collisions with existing macros or identifiers from included headers. All calls inside lfs_file_opencfg were updated accordingly. These changes preserve the original logic while preventing redefinition and macro-collision compilation errors."
