  "scenario": "The LFS_TRACE call sits in a reachable part of lfs_dir_close (executed when LFS_LOCK succeeds). As written it does not introduce any code that can never be executed. If LFS_TRACE is compiled out (macro expands to nothing) the source line disappears but that does not create unreachable code. Only if LFS_TRACE were defined to expand to an unconditional return, infinite loop, or other construct that makes subsequent code unreachable would Rule 2.1 be violated \u2014 there is no evidence of that here."
