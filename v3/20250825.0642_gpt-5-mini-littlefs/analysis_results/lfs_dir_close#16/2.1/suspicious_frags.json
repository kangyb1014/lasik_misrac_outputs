  "explanation": "No code in this function is intrinsically unreachable: the early return (if (err) { return err; }) and the subsequent statements are conditionally reachable depending on the result of LFS_LOCK and the behavior of lfs_dir_close_. The reason the listed fragments are flagged for investigation is that they contain calls to macros or external functions (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, lfs_dir_close_) that may alter control flow (for example, by expanding to return/goto/longjmp/exit in their definitions). Such expansions could render later statements unreachable even though, from this function alone, every statement can be reached on some execution path. All other textual parts of the function (the signature, braces, and local variable declaration) do not introduce unreachable code and therefore do not need further inspection for Rule 2.1 violations."
