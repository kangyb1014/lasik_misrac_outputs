  "explanation": "No code fragment in lfs_dir_close modifies the function parameters lfs or dir themselves. The function only:  - dereferences lfs to access lfs->cfg (allowed: the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified),  - casts the pointer values to void* for tracing (casting does not modify the pointer),  - passes lfs and dir to lfs_dir_close_ (passing parameters unchanged),  - uses LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK with lfs->cfg (these operate on the pointed-to object, not on the parameter variables). There are no assignments to lfs or dir, no pointer arithmetic on them, and no rebindings of those parameter names in this code. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
