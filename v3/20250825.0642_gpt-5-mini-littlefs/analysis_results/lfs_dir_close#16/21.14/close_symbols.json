  "explanation": "lfs_dir_close_: The target directly delegates work to this internal close routine; any use of memcmp to compare strings will appear in this function (or its callees). You must inspect its body to find memcmp uses and how arguments are derived.\nlfs_mlist_remove: Shown in the static call graph as a callee of lfs_dir_close_. If memcmp is used to compare names/keys it may be inside this routine; include it to follow comparisons transitively.\nmemcmp: The MISRA rule concerns the standard library memcmp. You need the memcmp symbol to (a) detect its use, (b) confirm it is the standard function (prototype), and (c) examine the actual arguments passed to determine whether they are null-terminated strings.\nlfs_dir_t: The dir structure is an argument to lfs_dir_close and likely contains name/buffer fields that could be passed to memcmp in callees. You need its definition to determine whether buffers/fields are null-terminated strings.\nlfs_t: The filesystem/context object passed to lfs_dir_close may carry configuration or buffer types (cfg, pointers) that are forwarded into deeper calls. Its definition is needed to trace how data flow produces the memcmp arguments.\n\nNotes: To determine a MISRA violation you must inspect the bodies of the listed functions and the definitions of the data structures they manipulate to see whether memcmp is invoked with operands that are null-terminated C-strings (instead of using strcmp/strcoll or explicit length-safe comparison). If lfs_dir_close_ or lfs_mlist_remove call other functions that use memcmp, include those symbols as well during the next analysis step."
