  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.14 forbids using the standard memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided snippet contains no direct calls to the standard memcmp, strncpy, strcmp, or similar string-library functions. The only expressions that could hide such a memcmp call are calls to helper/library functions, so those calls are flagged for inspection: lfs_dir_rewind_, lfs_pair_cmp, and lfs_dir_fetch may internally use memcmp to compare data (potentially strings). Other fragments in the function are plain integer arithmetic, assignments, control flow, or use of lfs_min (numeric min), and do not involve string data or standard-library string comparison \u2014 therefore they do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.14."
