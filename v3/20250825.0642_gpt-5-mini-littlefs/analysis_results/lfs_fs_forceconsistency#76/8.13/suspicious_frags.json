  "explanation": "Only the above fragments contain pointer usage that could be subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-valued expressions in this function (no local pointers, no pointer arithmetic, no other pointer parameters). The remaining lines (returns, boolean literal, error handling) do not involve pointer types and thus do not need investigation for const-qualification. To determine whether the lfs_t * parameter should be const requires inspection of the implementations/signatures of the called functions; those call sites are included above for that reason."
