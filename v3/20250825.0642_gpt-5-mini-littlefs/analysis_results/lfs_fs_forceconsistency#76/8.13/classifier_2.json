  "scenario": "This call would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 if the callee lfs_fs_desuperblock has a prototype taking a non-const lfs_t * but does not modify the pointed-to object. In that case the parameter should be declared as const lfs_t * and the pointer should point to a const-qualified type. With only this call-site (and given the function name suggests it likely modifies filesystem state), there is insufficient information to prove a violation \u2014 if lfs_fs_desuperblock legitimately modifies lfs then a non-const lfs_t * is appropriate and no rule violation occurs."
