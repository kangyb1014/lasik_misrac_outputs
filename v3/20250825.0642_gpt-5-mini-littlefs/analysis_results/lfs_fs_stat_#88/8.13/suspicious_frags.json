  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters and pointer-typed members that are only read and therefore could be qualified as pointing to const. I selected fragments that involve pointers (the function parameter lfs, taking the address of members, and reading fields through pointer members) because these are the places where const-qualification might be appropriate. I did NOT include fragments that are clearly non-pointer declarations or operations that write into objects (for example local variables 'dir' and 'superblock' themselves, uses of '&dir' and '&superblock' as outputs, the call to lfs_superblock_fromle32 which transforms/writes the superblock, or assignments to fsinfo which are deliberate outputs). Those cases require non-const pointers because the callee or the code modifies the pointed-to objects, so they are not suitable for const-qualification and therefore do not need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
