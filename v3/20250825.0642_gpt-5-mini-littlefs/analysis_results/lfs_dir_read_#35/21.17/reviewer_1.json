True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call strcpy(info->name, \"..\") will copy three bytes ('.' '.' '\\0') into info->name. If the destination array in struct lfs_info is not large enough to hold 3 bytes (for example, if it were declared as char name[2] or any size < 3), this call will write beyond the bounds of info->name and thus violate the rule. No bounds check is shown in the fragment, so the use is potentially unsafe.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA\u2011C:2023 Rule 21.17 forbids uses of the <string.h> functions that can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The agent\u2019s scenario is correct in principle: strcpy(info->name, \"..\") will copy three bytes ('.','.', '\\0'), so it would overflow if info->name were declared with length < 3.\n\nHowever, the fragment shown does not prove that such an overflow occurs. Whether the call actually violates Rule 21.17 depends on the declaration of struct lfs_info::name elsewhere in the codebase. If name is declared with sufficient storage (e.g. char name[3] or, more likely, a larger LFS_NAME_MAX+1), then the strcpy calls shown do not access beyond bounds and thus do not violate the rule. The reported violation is therefore not demonstrably correct from the fragment alone.\n\nRecommendation: make the guarantee explicit (documented/encoded in the type) or replace the call with a bounded-copy idiom (or add a compile-time/static assertion about sizeof(info->name) >= 3) so that compliance with Rule 21.17 is unambiguous.\n"
