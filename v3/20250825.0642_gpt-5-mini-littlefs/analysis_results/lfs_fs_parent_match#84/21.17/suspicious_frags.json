  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions that can access memory beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. In the provided snippets the only uses of <string.h> functions are the two memcpy calls inside lfs_bd_read, and the call site in lfs_fs_parent_match that requests a buffered read into the local array child (which triggers the memcpy behavior). No other calls to standard string functions (memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the supplied code, so there are no other direct candidates for Rule 21.17 investigation. Other helper functions shown (lfs_pair_fromle32, lfs_pair_cmp) operate on scalar values and do not use <string.h> functions. The device/read callbacks (lfs->cfg->read) are not standard <string.h> functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 for this analysis (they could be reviewed separately if their implementations use string.h functions). Finally, remaining pointer arithmetic and array accesses in the snippets are either simple scalar operations or protected by the conditional checks present in lfs_bd_read, so no additional string.h related fragments were found that require investigation under Rule 21.17."
