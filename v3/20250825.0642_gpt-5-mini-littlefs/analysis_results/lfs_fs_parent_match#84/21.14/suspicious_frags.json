  "explanation": "There are no explicit calls to memcmp in this function; the only comparison that could internally use memcmp (and thereby possibly compare NUL-terminated strings) is the call to lfs_pair_cmp in the return statement, so that line should be investigated. Other fragments do not warrant investigation for Rule 21.14: variable declarations and (void)tag are inert; lfs_bd_read only reads raw bytes (no string comparison); lfs_pair_fromle32 performs endianness conversion on binary data (not a string comparison). No other code in this function performs string comparisons or calls functions that are likely to compare null-terminated strings."
