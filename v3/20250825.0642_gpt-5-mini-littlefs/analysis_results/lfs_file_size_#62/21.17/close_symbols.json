  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking MISRA C string.h usage:\n\n- lfs_max (definition/implementation or macro): lfs_file_size_ calls lfs_max when the write flag branch is taken. To determine whether any string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/etc.) could be invoked through that call (and thus whether the rule could be violated), the actual implementation or macro expansion of lfs_max must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_file_t (complete struct definition, including flags, pos, ctz): The target function reads fields from the file object (flags, pos, ctz.size). To be sure these fields are scalar integer offsets and not pointers or structures that could lead to string.h calls or out-of-bounds accesses, the full struct layout and types are required.\n\n- lfs_ctz_t or whatever type provides file->ctz (definition, showing size field): The code returns file->ctz.size. Knowing the exact type of ctz.size (integer vs pointer or a type that may trigger pointer dereferences or string operations) is necessary to rule out any indirect use of string.h functions.\n\n- lfs_soff_t (typedef): lfs_file_size_ returns lfs_soff_t and passes values to lfs_max. Knowing whether lfs_soff_t is an integer type (signed/unsigned) or an alias for a pointer-like type is necessary to confirm no string.h functions are involved or no pointer arithmetic leads to out-of-bounds pointer parameters to string functions.\n\n- LFS_F_WRITING (macro/enum value): The branch that calls lfs_max is predicated on this flag. Understanding its definition (bitmask vs other) confirms how the branch is used and whether any unusual semantics could cause invocation of string.h functions.\n\n- LFS_READONLY (preprocessor macro): The presence/absence of this macro controls whether the branch containing lfs_max is even compiled. To determine whether any string.h usage via that branch is possible in the build under analysis, the macro value/configuration is required.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition): lfs is explicitly cast to void in the function, but providing the lfs_t definition ensures there are no hidden macros or inline behavior (via that type) that could alter the function or introduce string.h calls through inlining or macros referencing lfs.\n\nNotes: The target function itself contains no direct calls to string.h functions; the main risk is via the callee lfs_max or unexpected types inside file/ctz. Inspecting the listed symbols is sufficient to determine whether any call from this function could cause use of the string.h APIs and thus potentially violate the MISRA rule."
