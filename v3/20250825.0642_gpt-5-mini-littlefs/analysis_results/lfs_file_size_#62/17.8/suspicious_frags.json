  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the pointer parameters themselves (e.g., assigning to lfs or file, incrementing them, or otherwise changing the pointer value). In this function there are no assignments or operations that modify the parameter variables lfs or file. The line (void)lfs; merely suppresses an unused-parameter warning and does not modify lfs. All uses of file are field reads (file->flags, file->pos, file->ctz.size) which access or may read the object pointed to (allowed by the rule); there are no writes such as file = ..., file += ..., or file->field = ... in this function. The conditional block is read-only and the return expressions only evaluate values \u2014 they do not modify the pointer parameters. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
