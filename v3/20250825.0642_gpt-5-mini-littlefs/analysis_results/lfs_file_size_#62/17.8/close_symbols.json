  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_size_ violates the MISRA rule forbidding modification of function parameters you must be able to tell (1) whether the formal parameters themselves are ever assigned to, and (2) whether any called macro/function or conditional compilation could cause such an assignment. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- lfs_max: Provide the function or macro definition. If lfs_max is a macro it might expand in ways that evaluate or modify its arguments; we must confirm it does not assign to the function's formal parameters (or expand into code that refers to them by name).\n\n- lfs_file_t (full struct): The target parameter 'file' is of this type*. The struct definition (members flags, pos, ctz and the type of ctz.size) is needed to verify that accesses like file->flags, file->pos and file->ctz.size are simple reads (not invoking overloaded macros or unusual accessor side-effects) and to confirm 'file' is indeed a pointer to a struct (so the rule allows modification of the pointed object but forbids assigning to the pointer itself).\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/definition): Provide the type of parameter 'lfs' so we can confirm (void)lfs is not modifying the parameter and that 'lfs' is a pointer (or other type) subject to the same interpretation.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: The return type; its typedef/definition is useful to see if any implicit conversions or macros are involved in the return expressions that could hide assignments to parameters.\n\n- LFS_READONLY: The preprocessor symbol controls which code is compiled. We must inspect both branches (defined/undefined) to ensure no branch assigns to the formal parameters.\n\n- LFS_F_WRITING: The flag macro/value used in the conditional. Its definition could reveal unusual side-effects if implemented as a macro (rare but worth checking) or indicate that the conditional expands differently.\n\n(*) Also ensure there are no hidden macros/inline functions naming 'file' or 'lfs' that would be expanded here. If such macros exist, include their definitions as well."
