First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 were found because the provided function contains no for statements to assess. Rule 14.2 concerns the three clauses of a for loop (initialization, condition, and iteration) and the use/modification of the single loop counter and any loop control flags. The code shown only has: a function signature, a cast-to-void of lfs, a preprocessor guarded if-statement, and return statements (including a call to lfs_max). None of these are for loops, nor do they contain loop counters or loop clauses to evaluate against the rule.\n\nNotes for completeness: if lfs_max were a macro that expanded elsewhere into a for loop, that expansion is not present in the supplied fragment and thus is out of scope for this analysis. Also, the presence of the preprocessor guard (#ifndef LFS_READONLY) does not introduce any for loops in either branch of the provided code. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation under Rule 14.2."
