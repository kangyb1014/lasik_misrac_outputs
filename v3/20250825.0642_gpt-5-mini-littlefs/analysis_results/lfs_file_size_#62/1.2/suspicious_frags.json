  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: a static function, typedef\u2019d/project types (lfs_soff_t, lfs_t, lfs_file_t), a cast-to-void to suppress unused-variable warnings ((void)lfs;), a preprocessor conditional (#ifndef ...), bitwise flag test, member access (file->ctz.size), and a function or macro call (lfs_max). None of these are compiler extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, anonymous structs/unions, GCC/clang builtins, or other documented compiler-specific extensions are present). The use of lfs_max or custom types/macros is project-specific but not inherently a language extension, so they do not warrant reporting under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
