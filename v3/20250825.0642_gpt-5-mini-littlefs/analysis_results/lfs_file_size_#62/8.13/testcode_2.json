  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe parameter 'file' is declared as 'lfs_file_t *file' but the function only reads from the pointed-to object (file->flags, file->pos, file->ctz.size) and never modifies it. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should be const-qualified when possible. The signature should be e.g. 'const lfs_file_t *file' (and possibly 'const lfs_t *lfs') to avoid this violation.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_size_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/623.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_size_ as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_size_:\n```c\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_size_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n\n#ifndef LFS_READONLY\n    if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) {\n        return lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size);\n    }\n#endif\n\n    return file->ctz.size;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_file_size_ code.\n",
