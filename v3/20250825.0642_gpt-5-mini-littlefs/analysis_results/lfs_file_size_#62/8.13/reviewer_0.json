  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The parameter lfs is declared as lfs_t * but is not used or modified in the function (the code even does (void)lfs;). Under MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer parameter that does not modify the pointed-to object should be declared to point to a const-qualified type when possible. In this function the pointer could and should be declared const lfs_t *lfs. (The file parameter is appropriately non-const because its members are read.) Note: there may be pragmatic reasons to keep the non-const signature (e.g. to match other function prototypes or callbacks), but strictly speaking the current declaration violates Rule 8.13 and changing it to const lfs_t *lfs would resolve the violation."
