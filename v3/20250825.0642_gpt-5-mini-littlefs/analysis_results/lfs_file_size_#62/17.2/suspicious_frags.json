  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size);",
    "static lfs_soff_t lfs_file_size_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The only potential recursion points in this snippet are the function itself (its declaration/definition) and the call to lfs_max. All other parts of the code are simple, non-calling operations and therefore do not introduce direct or indirect self-calls: (void)lfs; is just a cast to suppress unused-parameter warnings; the #ifndef/#endif block only controls compilation of the enclosed code; the if condition (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) is a bitwise test and not a function call; accesses like file->pos and file->ctz.size are data reads; and the final statement return file->ctz.size; is a direct return of a field, not a function call. No function pointers, callbacks, or other call expressions appear in the fragment aside from the lfs_max call, so investigating the function header (to detect self-reference) and the lfs_max call (to see whether it might invoke lfs_file_size_ indirectly) is sufficient."
