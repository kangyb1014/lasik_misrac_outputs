  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment lfs_off_t b = lfs->cfg->block_size - 2*4; is an ordinary computation and does not create code that can never be executed. It does not make any following statements unreachable, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is not violated by this fragment. (Note: this line can still lead to runtime/UB issues\u2014e.g. b == 0 causing a division by zero later or signed/unsigned underflow depending on types\u2014but those are not instances of unreachable code.)"
