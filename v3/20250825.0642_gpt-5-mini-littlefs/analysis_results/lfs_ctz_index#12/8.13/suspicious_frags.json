  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they are not candidates for const qualification: the parameter off is dereferenced and assigned to (*off = ...), so it must remain a pointer to a non-const lfs_off_t; local variables (size, b, i) are not pointers; there are no other pointer declarations in the function body to consider. Any pointer-like accesses inside the function (e.g. members accessed via lfs) are covered by investigating the function parameter lfs itself."
