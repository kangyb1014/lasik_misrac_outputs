  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are obviously invariant in this function. The only control statement is:\n\nif (i == 0) {\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHere, i is calculated from runtime values (size = *off and b = lfs->cfg->block_size - 2*4), so the condition is not a compile-time/invariant expression and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no loops, do-while constructs, or other conditional controls with constant/invariant controlling expressions in the provided code. \n\n(Notes: potential issues such as division by zero or other runtime errors are outside the scope of Rule 14.3 and so were not flagged here.)"
