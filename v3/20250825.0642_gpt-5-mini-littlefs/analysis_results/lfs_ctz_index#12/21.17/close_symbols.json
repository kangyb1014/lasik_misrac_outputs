  "explanation": "lfs_popc: lfs_ctz_index calls lfs_popc(i) and lfs_popc(i-1). To determine whether any string.h functions are used (directly or indirectly) you must inspect lfs_popc's prototype and implementation to ensure it does not call memcpy/memmove/memset/etc. Also need its parameter and return types to reason about integer arithmetic here.\n\nlfs_t (type definition): lfs_ctz_index dereferences the lfs pointer (lfs->cfg). The lfs_t definition is required to confirm the type of cfg field (pointer vs inline), to check for any macros/overloaded behavior and to verify there are no hidden uses of string.h via lfs accessor macros.\n\nstruct lfs_config (the cfg type and its member block_size): The code uses lfs->cfg->block_size. You need the exact cfg struct (or typedef) and the type of block_size to (1) verify its type (signed/unsigned width) for correct arithmetic/overflows and (2) confirm that accessing this member cannot expand into any function calls that might use string.h functions.\n\nlfs_off_t (typedef): lfs_ctz_index uses lfs_off_t for arithmetic, division and assignments to *off. The definition (underlying integer type and signedness/width) is necessary to reason about integer division/overflow/underflow and whether any implicit conversions could cause out-of-bounds behavior that might indirectly lead to string.h usage in callees.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to (a) confirm that lfs_ctz_index itself contains no string.h calls and (b) inspect the single callee (lfs_popc) and the involved types/fields to ensure no hidden or indirect use of string.h functions or pointer/indexing that could violate the cited MISRA rule."
