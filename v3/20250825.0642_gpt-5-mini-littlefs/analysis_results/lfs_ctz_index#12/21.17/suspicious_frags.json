  "explanation": "No code fragments in this function invoke any of the standard string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The function only performs integer arithmetic, reads/writes scalar fields (*off, lfs->cfg->block_size) and calls lfs_popc with integer arguments. There are no buffer or array accesses nor any pointer parameters being passed to string-handling routines in this code, so no parts of this function need investigation under Rule 21.17."
