  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or other Standard Library string-comparison functions are present in the provided code. The function performs only integer arithmetic and assignments and calls lfs_popc (an integer operation), and accesses numeric members (lfs->cfg->block_size). There are no char* or null-terminated string manipulations, no includes or calls to <string.h>, and no uses of memcmp to compare strings. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
