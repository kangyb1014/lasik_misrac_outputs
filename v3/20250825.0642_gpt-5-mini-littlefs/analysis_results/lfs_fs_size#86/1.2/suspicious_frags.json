  "explanation": "I examined all code shown (function lfs_fs_size, its helper lfs_fs_size_, and the related macros and typedefs). None of the following are compiler-specific language extensions as used here: the (void) cast in LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK, the comma operator in the LFS_LOCK macro, the empty/variadic macro LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) (variadic macros are standard C99+), the use of PRId32 inside the format string (standard inttypes.h macro and adjacent string literal concatenation), the explicit (void*) pointer cast in the trace call, the typedef of lfs_ssize_t to int32_t, or the ordinary struct and function definitions. I also found no GCC/Clang-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __asm__, or other vendor\u2011specific keywords or builtins that would be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that appear to use compiler language extensions and require investigation for Rule 1.2."
