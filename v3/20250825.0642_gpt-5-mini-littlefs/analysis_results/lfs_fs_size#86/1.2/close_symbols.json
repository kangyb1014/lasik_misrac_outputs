  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked at function entry. Its definition may hide compiler extensions (e.g. inline assembly, __attribute__, statement-expressions, typeof, compiler builtins, or use of compiler-specific keywords). You must inspect it to determine if any language extensions are used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK; check its definition for compiler-specific constructs or extensions used in the unlocking implementation.\n- LFS_TRACE: Almost certainly a macro or wrapper around logging. Its definition can use variadic macros, GCC statement-expressions, __attribute__((format)), __func__, token-pasting, or other compiler-specific extensions. You must see its expansion to decide if the call in the target function uses a language extension.\n- PRId32: This macro (from <inttypes.h>) is used in the format string. Although normally standard, some toolchains may implement format-width macros or related helper macros as extensions. Checking its definition ensures no compiler-specific extension is being relied on.\n- lfs_t: The typedef/struct for lfs_t may use compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, bitfields with implementation-defined widths, or other nonstandard declarations). Its definition is needed to rule out extensions.\n- lfs_ssize_t: The typedef for the return type may be an alias to a compiler-specific integer type (e.g. __int128, compiler-specific sized types) or use extension attributes; inspect it to ensure it is standard C.\n- lfs_fs_size_: Although called from the target, its body is not needed to check the target\u2019s own textual constructs; however it must be examined because it might be a macro (or an inline/extern function defined with compiler-specific extensions) that changes how the call is expanded/compiled. If it is implemented with extensions, the call site could indirectly rely on them.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their definitions/expansions) lets you determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used directly by the target function or indirectly via invoked macros/types."
