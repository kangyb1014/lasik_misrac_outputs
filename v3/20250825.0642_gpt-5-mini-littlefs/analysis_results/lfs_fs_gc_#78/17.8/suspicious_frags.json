  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter variable lfs itself. There are no assignments to lfs (no occurrences of \"lfs = ...\", pointer arithmetic on lfs, or reinitialization of the parameter). The code only accesses and modifies the object pointed to by lfs (e.g., lfs->cfg->..., lfs->lookahead.size, lfs->cfg->compact_thresh), and calls functions with lfs as an argument. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 this is permitted (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified). Therefore no fragments require investigation under this rule."
