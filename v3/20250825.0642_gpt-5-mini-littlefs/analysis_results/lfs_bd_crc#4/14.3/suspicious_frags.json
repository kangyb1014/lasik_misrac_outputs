  "explanation": "Only the loop control and the variables that determine its progress are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (invariant controlling expressions). The listed fragments cover the loop header (the controlling expression and increment) and the initialization/assignment of the variable used to advance the loop; these should be investigated for potential invariant behavior. Other code in the function \u2014 the local array declaration (uint8_t dat[8];), the call to lfs_bd_read(...), the CRC update (*crc = lfs_crc(...);), the error check/return, and the final return 0 \u2014 do not affect the loop's controlling expression and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.3 compliance."
