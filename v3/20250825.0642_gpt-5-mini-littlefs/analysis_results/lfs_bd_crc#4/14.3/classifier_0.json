  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment diff = lfs_min(size - i, sizeof(dat)) depends on i (which is updated each loop iteration), so the loop controlling expression (i < size / i += diff) is not invariant. Although diff may equal sizeof(dat) for many iterations, it changes when size - i becomes smaller (final iteration), so the controlling expression is not invariant and Rule 14.3 is not violated."
