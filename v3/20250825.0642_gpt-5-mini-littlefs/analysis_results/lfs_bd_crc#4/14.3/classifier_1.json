  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression is i < size which is variant because i is updated each iteration (i += diff) and diff is assigned inside the loop to lfs_min(size - i, sizeof(dat)), so i changes and the condition is not invariant. (A violation would occur if diff remained zero so i never changed, making i < size invariant and causing an infinite loop.)"
