  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local array 'uint8_t dat[8];' is a mutable buffer used as the destination for lfs_bd_read, so it must be non-const. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations pointing to const-qualified types where possible; here dat is not a pointer declaration and making it const would prevent the read into it. Passing its address to functions (possibly as a const parameter for read-only APIs) does not create an unnecessary non-const pointer in this fragment."
