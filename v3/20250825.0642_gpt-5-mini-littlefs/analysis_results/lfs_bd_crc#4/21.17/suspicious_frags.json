  "explanation": "Only the fragments that perform or enable memory copies or hand buffers to read routines (memcpy calls, reads into 'data' or cache buffers, and the calls that pass the local dat buffer to lfs_bd_read / lfs_crc) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Those fragments are listed above for investigation because they are the sites where string.h copy operations occur or where a buffer is supplied to a function that writes bytes.\n\nOther code fragments in the provided listing do not call functions from <string.h> and do not directly perform byte-wise copies, so they cannot directly violate Rule 21.17. Boundary checks present in lfs_bd_read (the off+size > block_size check) and the use of lfs_min to limit diff in lfs_bd_crc mitigate many overflow paths; these checks and other control-flow logic are therefore not listed as suspicious themselves. The investigation should focus on the listed memcpy/read invocations and the calls that supply buffers to them to ensure the sizes passed never exceed the actual object bounds."
