Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to assess the MISRA C \"well-formed for loop\" rule for lfs_fs_grow:\n\n1) lfs_fs_grow_\n   - lfs_fs_grow simply calls lfs_fs_grow_. The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including behaviour of any functions called within that statement; therefore the implementation of lfs_fs_grow_ must be inspected for any for-loops (and whether those loops violate the rule).\n\n2) lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32\n   - These are the direct callees of lfs_fs_grow_. Any for-loops inside lfs_fs_grow_ may call these functions (or these functions themselves may contain for-loops). According to the rule, loops must not use or modify objects outside the allowed loop-counter/flag set and functions called inside loop bodies contribute to loop behaviour; therefore you must examine these functions for loops, for-loop counters, side-effects, and any modifications of objects used in loop clauses.\n\n3) LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE\n   - These are macros/operations used by lfs_fs_grow. Macros can expand into code containing loops or modify global/state objects referenced by loop clauses. To be sure no for-loop rule violation is introduced via macro expansion or interactions with locks/state, their definitions must be checked.\n\n4) lfs_t and lfs_size_t\n   - The types used in lfs_fs_grow. Loop counters or loop-control flags in called functions may be of these types or may operate on fields of lfs_t (for example lfs->cfg). To determine whether loop clauses use/modify objects that are changed in loop bodies, the layout and semantics of lfs_t and the definition of lfs_size_t (signed/unsigned width) are required.\n\n5) lfs_config (cfg)\n   - lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. The MISRA rule forbids use of objects that are modified in the loop body in the for-clause; if cfg or lock state is used as a loop control flag or is modified inside loops (directly or via called functions), that can cause a violation. Inspecting the cfg type and any state it carries is therefore necessary.\n\nNotes: The above list is minimal given the provided static call graph. If any of the listed functions call further functions, or if any macros expand to call further functions, those additional symbols must also be examined because the rule counts the behaviour of nested calls as part of the loop body."
