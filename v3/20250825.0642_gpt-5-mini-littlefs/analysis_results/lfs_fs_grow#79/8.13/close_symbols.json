  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_grow_: you must inspect its declaration/definition to see whether it mutates the filesystem through the lfs pointer. If lfs_fs_grow_ requires a non-const lfs_t * (writes through it), then lfs in the wrapper cannot be const. If it is const-correct, the wrapper might be made const.\n- lfs_t: the structure definition is required to know whether the function modifies members of lfs (directly or via macros) and to know the exact type/const-qualification of members (notably cfg).\n- type of lfs->cfg field (e.g. struct lfs_config): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; the const-qualification of that field (and whether it is a pointer and to what) affects whether the pointer types should be const and whether passing it to the lock/unlock macros loses/changes constness.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their prototypes/macros determine whether passing lfs->cfg (and any const-qualified pointer) would require casting away const or accept const pointers. They also show whether these macros modify pointed-to data.\n- LFS_TRACE: the trace call casts lfs to (void*) and forwards it to a logging macro; if lfs were const-qualified this cast could discard const and create a const-violation. You must inspect the macro/signature to see if it causes casting-away-const or if it accepts const arguments safely.\n- lfs_size_t: the typedef of block_count isn't a pointer itself but including it ensures correct interpretation of the PRIu32 use and lets you confirm there are no hidden pointer typedefs or macro expansions that would affect const qualification."
