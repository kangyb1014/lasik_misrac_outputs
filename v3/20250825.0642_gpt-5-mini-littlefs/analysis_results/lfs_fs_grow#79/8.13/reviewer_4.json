  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is plausible in principle (MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed requires pointer types to be const-qualified when they can be), but the supplied code does not prove the violation. The snippet shows the field declared as uint8_t *buffer in struct lfs_lookahead, but there is no evidence here that the pointed-to memory is never modified. To confirm a Rule 8.13 violation you must inspect all uses of lfs->lookahead.buffer across the whole codebase: look for writes through that pointer, calls to functions that take a non-const uint8_t * (or perform writes), or casts that drop const. If every use treats the memory as read-only (only passed to functions taking const uint8_t* or read operations), then the field should be changed to const uint8_t *buffer and Agent A\u2019s report would be correct. Given only the provided code, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a definite violation."
