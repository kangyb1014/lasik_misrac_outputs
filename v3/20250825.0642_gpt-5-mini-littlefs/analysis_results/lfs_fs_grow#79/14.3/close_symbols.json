  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The controlling expression if (err) directly tests the value returned by LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To decide whether that controlling expression is invariant you must inspect the LFS_LOCK macro/function body/definition to see if it always returns a constant or depends on its argument (or has side-effects).\n- lfs_t: The call uses lfs->cfg; the definition of lfs_t is required to determine the type and semantics of the cfg field (e.g. whether cfg is a pointer, volatile, etc.), which affects whether the return value of LFS_LOCK can vary with lfs state.\n- lfs_cfg (the type of lfs->cfg): If LFS_LOCK reads fields of cfg (or is implemented as a macro using cfg fields), you must inspect the cfg type and its fields to see whether different lfs instances or runtime state can change LFS_LOCK\u2019s result (i.e. make the controlling expression non\u2011invariant).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although it appears after the controlling if, its definition is useful to understand locking semantics and whether LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are paired macros/functions that could imply LFS_LOCK is a trivial constant or a real runtime check. It can also indicate if LFS_LOCK is a no\u2011op in some builds (which would make the controlling expression invariant).\n- lfs_fs_grow_ (prototype/definition): Included because it\u2019s the callee whose return value is stored in err later; while it does not affect the initial if (err) check, its prototype/visibility can indicate whether lfs_fs_grow_ might be inlined or macro\u2011expanded into this function in some build configurations (which could introduce additional controlling expressions into this function)."
