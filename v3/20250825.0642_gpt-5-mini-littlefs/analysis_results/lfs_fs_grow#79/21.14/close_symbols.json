  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (why required to decide if memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings):\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_: This is the immediate callee of the target. Its implementation must be examined to see whether it (or its callees) directly uses memcmp on string data.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit: These are the callees of lfs_fs_grow_. Directory functions are the likely places to compare names/strings (e.g. directory entry names). Their bodies must be inspected to find any memcmp usage and to determine what the compared buffers represent (null-terminated C strings vs fixed-length binary fields).\n\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32: These are other callees of lfs_fs_grow_. Although they look like byte-order converters (less likely to use memcmp on strings), their implementations still need checking so no memcmp usage is missed.\n\n- memcmp: The actual Standard Library function to detect. You need the symbol/uses of memcmp in the codebase to find calls and examine the arguments passed. Identifying calls to memcmp and then tracing the argument types/origins is necessary to determine if the rule is violated.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_size_t, lfs_superblock_t: Type definitions used in the signatures and internal data structures. Knowing the types and layout of these structs (especially fields holding names or buffers) is required to decide whether the buffers passed to memcmp are null-terminated strings or not.\n\n- (directory entry / name buffer types used by lfs_dir_* e.g. dir entry struct): The concrete definition of directory entry structures or name buffers used by the lfs_dir_* functions is crucial to determine whether comparisons operate on null-terminated strings (illegal for memcmp) or on fixed-length byte arrays (permitted).\n\nIn short: you must obtain the implementations of lfs_fs_grow_ and all its direct callees (and the type/layout of any data they compare), plus any occurrences of memcmp, to decide whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings."
