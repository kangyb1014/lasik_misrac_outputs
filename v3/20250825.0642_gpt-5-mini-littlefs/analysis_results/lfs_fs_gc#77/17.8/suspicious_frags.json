  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided functions modify the function parameter pointer itself. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameter variable (no occurrences like \"lfs = ...\", \"lfs++\", or \"lfs += ...\") in lfs_fs_gc or lfs_fs_gc_.\n- All uses of lfs access or modify the object it points to (e.g., lfs->cfg, lfs->lookahead, setting fields via functions called with lfs), which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object pointed to may be modified).\n- The LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros, as defined, do not modify their argument (they evaluate ((void)cfg,0) and ((void)cfg) respectively), so the macro calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) do not modify the pointer parameter lfs nor lfs->cfg itself.\n- LFS_TRACE uses a cast (void*)lfs and an empty macro body in the provided definition, so it does not modify the parameter.\n- Local variables (e.g., mdir) are modified, and functions called with lfs (e.g., lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan) may modify the object pointed to by lfs, which is allowed; such calls do not reassign the parameter variable inside the analyzed functions.\n\nBecause none of the code in the provided fragments assigns to or otherwise modifies the pointer parameter itself, there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to report from these snippets."
