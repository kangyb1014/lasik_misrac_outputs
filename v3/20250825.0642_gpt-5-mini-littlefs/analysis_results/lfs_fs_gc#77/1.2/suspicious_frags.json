  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language-extension constructs are present in the provided code fragment. I found no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, typeof, statement-expression syntax ({ ... }), labels-as-values, GCC built-ins (e.g. __builtin_*), or other implementation-specific keywords. The code uses standard C constructs only: function calls, integer return, pointer cast (void*) and macros invoked by name (LFS_LOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK). Note: the macros LFS_LOCK, LFS_TRACE and LFS_UNLOCK as used here might expand to code that uses compiler extensions, but those expansions are not visible in the provided snippet. Per the rule you requested, I report only explicit uses of language extensions appearing in the shown code; therefore no suspicious fragments are reported. If you need confirmation that macro expansions are extension-free, provide their definitions for inspection."
