  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_gc_: Must inspect the full implementation to determine whether it always returns normally, can loop forever, calls exit/longjmp or otherwise does not return; any of those make the code after the call in lfs_fs_gc() unreachable.  \n- LFS_LOCK: The lock expression is tested for an error return; its definition (macro or function) is needed to know whether it can perform non-local control-flow (e.g. longjmp/exit/throw) or have side-effects that affect reachability.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: Similarly, the unlock may be a macro/function that could perform non-local control-flow; verify it does not render subsequent code unreachable or rely on invariants affecting reachability.  \n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing is usually a no-op, but macros can expand to complex code (including returns or goto) in some builds; check its definition to ensure it cannot make code unreachable.  \n- lfs_t: The type definition (and in particular the type of its cfg member) is required to understand how LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are invoked and whether cfg can cause different behavior affecting control flow.  \n- lfs->cfg (configuration type): Explicitly list the cfg type used by LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK to examine any macros or inline functions that operate on it and could affect reachability.  \n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: These are the callees of lfs_fs_gc_. If any of them perform non-local control-flow (exit/longjmp/noreturn) or contain infinite loops, that can make the remainder of lfs_fs_gc (and thus code after the call in the top-level lfs_fs_gc) unreachable. To conclude no unreachable code exists in the target function, you must inspect lfs_fs_gc_ and these functions it calls."
