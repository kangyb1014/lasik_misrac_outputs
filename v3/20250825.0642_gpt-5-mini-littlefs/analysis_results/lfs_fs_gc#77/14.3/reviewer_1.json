True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe controlling expression if (err) is invariant because err is initialized from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), and the provided macro definition #define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0) always yields 0. Thus the if test is effectively if (0) (an invariant false), so the controlling expression is invariant and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The listed exceptions do not apply (not an infinite loop and not the permitted do-while case).\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_fs_gc_ returned 0\nlfs_fs_gc: calling LFS_UNLOCK (about to release lock)\nlfs_fs_gc: returned with err=0\nlfs_fs_gc: after LFS_LOCK -> err=0, lfs=0x7ffc7805f4d8\nlfs_fs_gc: proceeding to lfs_fs_gc_ (err was 0)\nlfs_fs_gc: lfs_\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_gc:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With the provided macro definition LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0) the initialization err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) always yields 0, so the controlling expression if (err) is equivalent to if (0) and is therefore an invariant false expression. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions, and neither of the listed exceptions (infinite loops or the permitted do-while constant-false case) applies here. (If LFS_LOCK is defined differently in other build configurations to return a non-constant value, the expression would not be invariant; but given the supplied macro definition the claim of a violation is correct.)"
