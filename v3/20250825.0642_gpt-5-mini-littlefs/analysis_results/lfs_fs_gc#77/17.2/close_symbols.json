  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_gc violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls you must examine all functions it can reach. lfs_fs_gc_ is the immediate callee and must be inspected for any path back to lfs_fs_gc. Each function called by lfs_fs_gc_ (lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan) must be examined (and their transitive callees) to see if any call back to lfs_fs_gc or form a recursion cycle. In practice you will need the source or call-graph entries for these symbols to trace transitive calls and prove absence (or presence) of indirect recursion."
