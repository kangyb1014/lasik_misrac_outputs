  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the function lfs_fs_gc takes a non-const lfs_t *lfs and calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and lfs_fs_gc_(lfs), which imply modification/side-effects on the filesystem state. Because the pointed-to object is likely modified by these operations, it is appropriate that the parameter is non-const. If the function did not modify *lfs, then the parameter should be const, but given the code, Rule 8.13 is not violated."
