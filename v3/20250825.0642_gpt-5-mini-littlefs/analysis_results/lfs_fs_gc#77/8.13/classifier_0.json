  "scenario": "The fragment itself (err = lfs_fs_gc_(lfs);) does not by itself violate Rule 8.13. A violation would occur if the called function lfs_fs_gc_ is declared/defined to take a non-const pointer (e.g. int lfs_fs_gc_(lfs_t *lfs)) but does not actually modify the object pointed to \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared const (int lfs_fs_gc_(const lfs_t *lfs)). To determine a definite violation you must inspect the prototype/definition of lfs_fs_gc_."
