  "explanation": "- struct lfs_t (full definition): needed to determine whether the parameter lfs and its members (especially members that get passed on) could be const-qualified. You must see member types (e.g. cfg) and whether any fields are modified.\n- type of lfs->cfg (declaration): LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg; to judge whether cfg could be const (and whether passing it requires dropping const) you need the cfg type.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): called with lfs->cfg. Its parameter type determines whether cfg (and therefore lfs) must be non-const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): same reason as LFS_LOCK; its parameter type can force non-const qualification.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function prototype/definition): used with (void*)lfs; the expected parameter types determine whether the cast discards const and thus whether lfs can/should be const-qualified.\n- lfs_fs_gc_ (prototype and definition): the called internal function receives lfs; its signature and implementation determine whether lfs is modified or passed to non-const APIs (which prevents declaring the original parameter const).\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency (prototype/definition): called by lfs_fs_gc_; its parameter types/usages may require a non-const lfs or other non-const members, preventing const qualification upstream.\n- lfs_pair_isnull (prototype/definition): included because it is called by lfs_fs_gc_; its parameter expectations could affect const-qualification decisions.\n- lfs_dir_fetch (prototype/definition): may modify directory state via lfs, so its prototype/definition is needed to see if non-const lfs is required.\n- lfs_dir_commit (prototype/definition): likely mutates state; its parameter types/usage will determine whether lfs (or members) must be non-const.\n- lfs_alloc_scan (prototype/definition): may alter allocation state via lfs; its signature and code determine whether const qualification of lfs is possible.\n\nIn short: to decide whether lfs (and related pointers) can be const-qualified you must inspect the definition of lfs_t/cfg, the lock/trace APIs that take lfs or lfs->cfg, and the full signature/usage of lfs_fs_gc_ and all functions it calls (listed in the call graph) because any of those that require or perform non-const operations will prevent adding const."
