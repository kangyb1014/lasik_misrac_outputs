  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions. The code only uses standard C features (for example, the compound literal &(uint8_t){0} and // comments are standard in C99). No compiler-specific tokens or constructs appear (no __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_* functions, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific extensions). The LFS_ASSERT macro expands to assert (standard), and the integer typedefs use standard <stdint.h> types. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as defined in your instruction."
