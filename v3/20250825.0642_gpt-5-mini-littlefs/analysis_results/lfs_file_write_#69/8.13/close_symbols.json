  "explanation": "- lfs_file_flushedwrite: The target forwards the 'buffer' argument to this function. To check const-correctness you must see its prototype/definition to know whether it accepts a const void * (or other const-qualified pointer). If it takes a non-const pointer (e.g. void *), passing a const-qualified buffer (or passing the buffer into a function that expects a non-const pointer) would be a MISRA concern.\n- lfs_file_flush: Called earlier in this function and may in turn call other routines that take pointers. Its prototype/definition is needed to ensure no pointer constness violations arise from how file or lfs pointers are passed/used and to inspect any casts it performs that could affect constness analysis.\n- lfs_file_write: This wrapper is a caller of lfs_file_write_. Inspecting its prototype/definition and how it forwards its buffer argument is necessary to determine whether callers use non-const pointer types where const could be used (MISRA focuses on declarations across the call chain).\n- struct lfs_file_t: The function manipulates the 'file' parameter and its members. You need the struct definition to discover any pointer-typed members that might be declared non-const but could/should be const, and to confirm whether members modified here legitimately prevent const qualification.\n- struct lfs_t: The 'lfs' parameter is passed through to other functions; its definition is required to check whether any pointer-typed members or functions operating on it should be const-qualified and to verify whether making lfs a pointer-to-const would be possible.\n\nThese symbols allow analysis of the pointer parameter and related call-chain/prototype const qualifications to determine if the target function (or its callers/callees) violate the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
