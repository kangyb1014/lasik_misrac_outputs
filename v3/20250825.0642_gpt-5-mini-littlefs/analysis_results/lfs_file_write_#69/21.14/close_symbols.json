  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_write_ (or any function it invokes transitively) uses the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect all functions that lfs_file_write_ directly calls and their transitive callees (because memcmp could be used anywhere down the call chain or in code paths triggered by lfs_file_write_). In particular:\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: lfs_file_write_ forwards the user buffer and size to this function; it is the most likely place to call memcmp on the provided buffer or to treat the buffer as a C-string.\n- lfs_file_flush: directly called by lfs_file_write_; it itself calls other helpers which may call memcmp or operate on buffers as strings.\n- lfs_cache_drop: called by lfs_file_flush; may contain buffer comparisons or string handling.\n- lfs_file_flushedread: called by lfs_file_flush; could use memcmp on read data.\n- lfs_bd_flush: called by lfs_file_flush; block-device level code might compare buffers.\n- lfs_file_relocate: called by lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite; may manipulate and compare data.\n- lfs_max: listed as a callee (likely a macro/inline) referenced by flush/write paths; include to inspect any wrapper behavior.\n- lfs_file_outline: called by lfs_file_flushedwrite; may perform comparisons on metadata or data buffers.\n- lfs_ctz_find: called by lfs_file_flushedwrite and truncate code paths; may inspect data chunks.\n- lfs_cache_zero: called by lfs_file_flushedwrite; may initialize or compare buffers.\n- lfs_alloc_ckpoint: called by lfs_file_flushedwrite; allocate/checkpoint code could compare structures.\n- lfs_ctz_extend: called by lfs_file_flushedwrite; may operate on ranges and buffers.\n- lfs_min: listed as callee (likely macro/inline) used in write paths; include for completeness.\n- lfs_bd_prog: block-device programming routine called by flushedwrite; may compare blocks.\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function under the MISRA rule \u2014 include its usage sites to detect forbidden comparisons of null-terminated strings.\n\nIncluding these symbols (the direct callees and their transitive callees shown in the static call graph, plus memcmp itself) lets the next analyst inspect every function that could plausibly call memcmp or treat buffers as NUL-terminated strings in the execution paths reachable from lfs_file_write_."
