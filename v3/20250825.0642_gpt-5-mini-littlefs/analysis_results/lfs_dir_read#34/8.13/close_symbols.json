  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201ca pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d you must know whether the function or any callees modify the objects pointed to, or pass them to APIs that require mutable pointers. Reasons for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_dir_read_: the target forwards its pointer parameters to this internal function. You must inspect its signature and body to see whether it writes through lfs, dir, or info (which determines whether those parameters can be const in the wrapper).\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct): the parameter lfs is a pointer to this type. You need the type definition to see if lfs is modified (fields written), and to inspect the type of its member cfg.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (type/struct): the parameter dir points to this type. Its definition is needed to determine whether lfs_dir_read or its callees write into dir (members), so dir can or cannot be const.\n\n- struct lfs_info (definition): same as above for info \u2014 must know whether the function/callees modify the info object (populate results) so it cannot be const.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg struct/typedef): lfs_dir_read invokes LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). The exact type of cfg and whether locking APIs accept a const or non-const pointer determines whether lfs must be non-const (because accessing cfg to pass to a non-const-taking lock would require lfs itself to be mutable).\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): its parameter type/usage determines whether passing lfs->cfg requires a non-const argument (which may force lfs to be non-const). Also macros could modify their argument; inspect to see if they create side effects that require mutability.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): same reasoning as LFS_LOCK for unlocking; both affect whether cfg (and thus lfs) must be non-const.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch (prototype/definition) and lfs_dir_getinfo (prototype/definition): these are called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_dir_read_. Their signatures/bodies reveal whether they modify dir/info or accept non-const pointers. If they modify pointed-to data, the parameters cannot be const.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): even though it typically only logs, it casts pointers to void*. Inspecting it confirms it does not mutate pointed-to objects and whether it requires non-const arguments; this eliminates a false reason to avoid const.\n\nInclude these symbols (signatures and/or definitions/implementations) so the next analyst can determine whether any of the pointer parameters could be const-qualified without violating the code\u2019s usage."
