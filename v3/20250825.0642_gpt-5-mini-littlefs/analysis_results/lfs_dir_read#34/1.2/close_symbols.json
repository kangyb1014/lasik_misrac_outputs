  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_dir_read uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions it directly uses: \n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/definition): The call to LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is a macro invocation. The macro body may contain compiler-specific extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_ functions, __attribute__, typeof, inline assembly). You must see its definition to determine if such extensions are used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/definition): Symmetrically, LFS_UNLOCK may hide extensions; inspect its definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition/implementation): LFS_TRACE is invoked with format strings and casts. It may be a variadic macro, or implemented using compiler extensions (attributes like __attribute__((format)), GCC statement-expr, __builtin_printf, or other non-standard constructs). Its definition/implementation is needed to rule out extensions.\n\n- lfs_dir_read_ (prototype and/or definition): The call to lfs_dir_read_ crosses a function boundary. The prototype/definition may declare non-standard attributes or use compiler-specific keywords (e.g. inline semantics, noreturn, __attribute__, registers, calling-convention attributes). Check its declaration/definition.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): The code accesses lfs->cfg and passes (void*)lfs to LFS_TRACE. The lfs_t definition might include compiler-specific extensions (bit-field extensions, packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, typeof-based members, or other non-standard constructs). Inspect it.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (type/struct definition): The dir object is cast to (void*) and passed to LFS_TRACE; its type definition might use extensions (anonymous/unnamed fields, attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct lfs_info (type/struct definition): The info object is cast and passed; the struct definition might use extensions.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyzer examine all macro expansions and type/function declarations that could hide compiler-specific language extensions; without them you cannot reliably determine compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
