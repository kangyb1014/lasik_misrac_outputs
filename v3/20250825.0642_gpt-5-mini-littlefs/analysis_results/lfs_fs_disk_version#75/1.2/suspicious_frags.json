  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs only: a static function, standard fixed-width type (uint32_t), a cast to void to silence an unused-parameter warning, and standard preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #endif / #else). There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, inline assembly, #pragma with implementation-defined behavior, __extension__, GCC nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords. The placement of the #endif inside the if/else structure is a legal use of the standard C preprocessor and not a compiler extension. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
