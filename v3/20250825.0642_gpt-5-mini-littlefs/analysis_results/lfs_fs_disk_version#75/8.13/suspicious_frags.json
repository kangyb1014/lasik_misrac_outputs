  "explanation": "Fragments not reported do not appear to violate Rule 8.13 in the shown code. The lfs_t member \"const struct lfs_config *cfg;\" is already a pointer to a const-qualified type, so it satisfies the rule. Other members shown are arrays or non-pointer scalar types (e.g. lfs_block_t root[2], uint32_t seed, numeric size fields) and thus are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. The function body only reads lfs->cfg->disk_version (access via the const-qualified cfg), so the remaining code inside the function is not itself a pointer declaration needing const-qualification. The fragments listed should be investigated to determine whether those pointers are only used for read access and therefore should point to const-qualified types."
