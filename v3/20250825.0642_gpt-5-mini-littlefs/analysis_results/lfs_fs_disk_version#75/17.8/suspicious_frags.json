  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function does not modify the parameter or the pointer itself: there are no assignments to lfs (no statements like lfs = ..., ++lfs, or pointer arithmetic), and the only uses of lfs are reads of its members (lfs->cfg->disk_version) and the (void)lfs; discard cast to silence unused-parameter warnings. Reading the object pointed to is permitted by Rule 17.8; the pointer itself is not altered anywhere in the function, so no code here needs further investigation for this rule."
