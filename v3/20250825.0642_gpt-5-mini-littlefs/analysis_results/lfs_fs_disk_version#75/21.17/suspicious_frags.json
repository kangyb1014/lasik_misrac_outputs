  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function lfs_fs_disk_version or in the related definitions. The function merely reads and returns a uint32_t (either lfs->cfg->disk_version or LFS_DISK_VERSION) and contains no pointer arithmetic or buffer manipulations. The provided struct definitions declare fields and function pointer types (e.g. read/prog) but do not invoke any string-handling operations; calls through those function pointers are not present in the shown code. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (bounds safety for <string.h> functions) is not applicable to any fragment shown and there are no suspicious fragments to investigate."
