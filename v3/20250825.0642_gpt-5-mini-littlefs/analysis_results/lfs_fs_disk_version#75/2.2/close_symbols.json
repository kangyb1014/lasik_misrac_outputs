  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_disk_version is dead code we must know whether it can be executed and whether its removal would change program behaviour. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): The function reads from its lfs_t* parameter (via lfs->cfg). You must know the layout and semantics of lfs_t to determine reachability and side-effects related to the object passed in.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg and its disk_version member (configuration struct): The function conditionally reads cfg->disk_version. To know whether that read can return anything other than a compile-time constant (and thus whether the runtime branch is meaningful), you need the definition of the config struct and the disk_version field (its type, valid values, and whether it can be initialized/changed elsewhere).\n\n- LFS_MULTIVERSION (build macro): The function code is controlled by this conditional compilation. If LFS_MULTIVERSION is not defined the cfg->disk_version branch is not compiled in; you must know the build configuration to decide if the code path exists at all.\n\n- LFS_DISK_VERSION (macro): The function may return this constant. To evaluate whether replacing calls with the constant would preserve behaviour (i.e., whether the function is effectively redundant), you must know this macro's value.\n\n- lfs_fs_disk_version_major and lfs_fs_disk_version_minor: These callers use the target function. You need their code to see how they use the returned value (e.g., only for logging vs. for control flow), which is crucial to decide if removing the target function changes behaviour.\n\n- lfs_format_ and lfs_format: lfs_format_ calls the target function; lfs_format is the public wrapper. You must inspect these to determine whether the call is reachable from application code and whether the returned version affects observable behaviour (formatting, persistent state, timing, etc.).\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_ and lfs_fs_stat: lfs_fs_stat_ calls the target function; lfs_fs_stat is likely a public API. Their code shows whether the returned value influences externally visible state or outputs (affects dead-code determination).\n\n- lfs_fs_desuperblock and lfs_fs_forceconsistency: desuperblock calls the target; forceconsistency calls desuperblock. These functions may be part of recovery/consistency logic where timing/state changes matter; you must see whether the returned version influences filesystem state transitions.\n\n- lfs_mount_: Listed as a caller (of the major/minor helpers) and typically initializes runtime state. You must examine it because it is a common entry point; if mount (or its callers) is reachable from application code, then the target function is reachable and likely not dead.\n\n- lfs_init and lfs_deinit: lfs_format_ calls lfs_init / lfs_deinit; lfs_init may set default configuration or mutate cfg->disk_version. To determine whether cfg->disk_version can actually vary (making the runtime branch meaningful) you need these initialization/deinitialization routines.\n\nIn short: you need the type/layout of lfs and cfg (and any code that sets cfg->disk_version), the build macro that gates the branch, the constant macro returned, and the callers (and their callers/public wrappers) to establish reachability and whether the function's return value affects observable behaviour. These symbols provide the minimal context to decide if the function (or parts of it) is dead code under the MISRA definition."
