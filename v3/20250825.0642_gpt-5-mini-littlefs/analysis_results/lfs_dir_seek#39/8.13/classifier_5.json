  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) is passing a pointer to a lock/config object that is being acted on (unlock operation) and thus must be mutable; making it const would prevent the unlock from modifying state. Rule 8.13 requires adding const only when the pointed-to object is used read-only \u2014 that is not the case here."
