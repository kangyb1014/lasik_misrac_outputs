  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce or pass non-const-qualified pointer types: - The local scalar declaration and returns (e.g. \"int err\", \"return err;\") are non-pointer entities. - Format strings and macros like PRIu32 are not pointer objects requiring const qualification. - The trace call arguments that are non-pointer values (e.g. off) are not subject to pointer-to-const qualification. - The LFS_TRACE format string itself is a string literal (already effectively const) and other surrounding statements (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_seek -> %d\", err);) do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. Therefore only the listed fragments involve pointer parameters or pointer uses that should be inspected for possible const-qualification."
