  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment passes a string literal as the format argument to LFS_TRACE. There is no pointer variable declared here that should have been const-qualified. The rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations/definitions pointing to data that should be const; this snippet does not show any such declaration. (If the LFS_TRACE prototype incorrectly takes a non-const char * for a format string, that would be a separate issue, but nothing in the shown fragment itself violates 8.13.)"
