  "explanation": "lfs_dir_seek_: immediate callee of the target. You must inspect its body to see whether it calls lfs_dir_seek (direct recursion) or calls back to itself or other functions that form a cycle (indirect recursion).\n\nlfs_dir_rewind_: called by lfs_dir_seek_. It must be checked in case it (directly or via other calls) calls lfs_dir_seek or lfs_dir_seek_ (creating an indirect recursion).\n\nlfs_min: called by lfs_dir_seek_. Although likely a small utility, its implementation must be checked in case it contains calls (or calls other functions) that could reach lfs_dir_seek or lfs_dir_seek_.\n\nlfs_pair_cmp: called by lfs_dir_seek_. Inspect to ensure it does not call back into lfs_dir_seek or lfs_dir_seek_ (directly or indirectly).\n\nlfs_dir_fetch: called by lfs_dir_seek_. Must be inspected for any calls that could transitively lead back to lfs_dir_seek or lfs_dir_seek_.\n\nNote: after retrieving these definitions, also examine any additional functions they call (their transitive callees). The MISRA rule requires checking the entire reachable call graph from the target for cycles, so include any further callees discovered while inspecting the listed symbols."
