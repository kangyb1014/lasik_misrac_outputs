  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): The call err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) appears at the start. If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand into code that assigns to identifiers in the caller (for example reusing the parameter names). You must inspect its definition to confirm it does not modify the function parameters lfs, dir or off.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Called at the end (LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg)). As with LFS_LOCK, if implemented as a macro it could perform assignments that affect the local parameter variables; its definition is required to rule that out.  \n- LFS_TRACE (macro): The tracing invocations pass (void*)lfs, (void*)dir and off. Trace is commonly a macro that may evaluate or (less commonly) assign its arguments; its expansion must be checked to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameters or the scalar off.  \n- lfs_dir_seek_ (declaration/definition): This is the callee. If it is a macro or an inline function it could expand into code that mutates the caller's parameter variables; its signature/body is needed to determine whether the call could modify lfs, dir, or off in the caller. If it is a normal function, it cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables, but the definition/decl confirms which.  \n- typedef/definition of lfs_t (including member cfg): The type of the first parameter and the member cfg are used by the macros/functions above. Knowing the structure helps determine whether expressions like lfs->cfg could be macros themselves or alias to something that allows parameter modification.  \n- typedef/definition of lfs_dir_t: Needed to check whether dir is truly a pointer type (as declared) or a typedef that could hide a different type; also to confirm whether any casts in macros could change semantics.  \n- typedef/definition of lfs_off_t: The type of off must be known to ensure it is a scalar passed by value (so cannot be used by callees to reassign the caller's local variable) and to detect any typedef-to-pointer oddities.\n\nThese symbols collectively let you determine whether any macro expansions or called/inline code can reassign the parameter variables (lfs, dir, off) inside lfs_dir_seek, which is what the MISRA rule forbids."
