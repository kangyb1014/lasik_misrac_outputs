  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are provably unreachable in the supplied snippets.\n\nReasons:\n- lfs_bd_sync: Control flows naturally. After calling lfs_bd_flush, the function returns early only if err != 0; the subsequent call to lfs->cfg->sync(lfs->cfg) and the final return are reachable whenever lfs_bd_flush returns 0. There is no code following an unconditional return or other construct that would make any statement unreachable.\n\n- lfs_bd_flush: The body that performs programming and validation is guarded by the condition (pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_NULL && pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_INLINE). That block is reachable whenever pcache->block has a value that satisfies the condition. The function ends with return 0; which is reachable when the guarded block is skipped or completes without errors. The early returns (on err or on validation mismatch) are normal control-flow exits, not unreachable code.\n\n- lfs_cache_drop: The function simply sets rcache->block = LFS_BLOCK_NULL. There is no further code or unreachable statements.\n\n- Use of LFS_ASSERT: Assertions may expand to no-ops in some builds, but that does not by itself introduce unreachable code in these fragments; the following statements are still reachable at runtime and the code does not contain code after an unconditional return or after constructs that always transfer control elsewhere.\n\nGiven the provided code, there are no visible dead/unreachable statements to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If additional macros (e.g., LFS_ASSERT) or external configuration change control flow in non-obvious ways (for example, if LFS_ASSERT contains a call to exit() or longjmp in some builds), please provide their definitions so they can be re-evaluated."
