  "explanation": "The primary potential unreachable-code issue is the use of goto/label inside the inner write-retry loop: the \"while (true)\" block contains an unconditional break for the normal path, and a goto that jumps to the relocate label. This control flow is non-linear and should be inspected to ensure no path makes parts of the loop body unreachable (or creates compiler/analysis surprises). The lfs_ctz_find block is included because it takes the address of a compound literal (&(lfs_off_t){0}) and contains early returns; its control-flow and lifetime semantics should be reviewed to ensure no unreachable statements result. The initial inline->outline conversion block is included because it performs an early return on error and changes flags that affect later branches; verify it does not make subsequent code unreachable.\n\nOther fragments in the function do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the remaining if/while structures have clear, conditional entry/exit points; returns are conditional and terminate the function as intended; assignments and calls after those conditionals are reachable through the documented conditions. The label \"relocate\" is reachable via the explicit goto; no unconditional jump or return precedes code that would render it unreachable in all paths. Therefore only the above fragments warrant further inspection for potential Rule 2.1 violations."
