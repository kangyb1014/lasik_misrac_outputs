  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call passes the address of a compound literal &(lfs_off_t){0} as the out-parameter for 'off'. In lfs_ctz_find() there is a case 'if (size == 0) { *block = LFS_BLOCK_NULL; *off = 0; return 0; }'. If file->ctz.size == 0 that assignment '*off = 0' is executed but only writes into the temporary compound literal whose value is never used by the caller, so the write has no effect on program behaviour. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_flushedwrite code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/502.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_flushedwrite as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_flushedwrite:\n```c\nstatic lfs_ssize_t lfs_file_flushedwrite(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    const uint8_t *data = buffer;\n    lfs_size_t nsize = size;\n\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE) &&\n            lfs_max(file->pos+nsize, file->ctz.size) > lfs->inline_max) {\n        // inline file doesn't fit anymore\n        int err = lfs_file_outline(lfs, file);\n        if (err) {\n            file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    while (nsize > 0) {\n        // check if we need a new block\n        if (!(file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) ||\n                file->off == lfs->cfg->block_size) {\n            if (!(file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE)) {\n                if (!(file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) && file->pos > 0) {\n                    // find out which block we're extending from\n                    int err = lfs_ctz_find(lfs, NULL, &file->cache,\n                            file->ctz.head, file->ctz.size,\n                            file->pos-1, &file->block, &(lfs_off_t){0});\n                    if (err) {\n                        file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n                        return err;\n                    }\n\n                    // mark cache as dirty since we may have read data into it\n                    lfs_cache_zero(lfs, &file->cache);\n                }\n\n                // extend file with new blocks\n                lfs_alloc_ckpoint(lfs);\n                int err = lfs_ctz_extend(lfs, &file->cache, &lfs->rcache,\n                        file->block, file->pos,\n                        &file->block, &file->off);\n                if (err) {\n                    file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n                    return err;\n                }\n            } else {\n                file->block = LFS_BLOCK_INLINE;\n                file->off = file->pos;\n            }\n\n            file->flags |= LFS_F_WRITING;\n        }\n\n        // program as much as we can in current block\n        lfs_size_t diff = lfs_min(nsize, lfs->cfg->block_size - file->off);\n        while (true) {\n            int err = lfs_bd_prog(lfs, &file->cache, &lfs->rcache, true,\n                    file->block, file->off, data, diff);\n            if (err) {\n                if (err == LFS_ERR_CORRUPT) {\n                    goto relocate;\n                }\n                file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n                return err;\n            }\n\n            break;\nrelocate:\n            err = lfs_file_relocate(lfs, file);\n            if (err) {\n                file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n                return err;\n            }\n        }\n\n        file->pos += diff;\n        file->off += diff;\n        data += diff;\n        nsize -= diff;\n\n        lfs_alloc_ckpoint(lfs);\n    }\n\n    return size;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_file_flushedwrite code.\n",
