  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: static functions, standard integer types (uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t from <stdint.h>), bitwise operations, goto/labels (standard C), and a compound literal (&(lfs_off_t){0}) which is a standard C99 feature (not a compiler extension). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler, or other vendor-specific built-ins. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
