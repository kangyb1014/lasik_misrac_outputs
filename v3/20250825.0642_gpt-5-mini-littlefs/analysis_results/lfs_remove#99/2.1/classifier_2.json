  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the LFS_TRACE call is placed on a reachable path and does not itself create unreachable code. A violation would occur if the LFS_TRACE macro were defined so that it always prevents subsequent code from executing (for example, if it expanded to a return or if it wrapped its arguments in an if(0) { ... } block). In that case the subsequent call to lfs_remove_ and the unlock/return would be unreachable, violating Rule 2.1."
