  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the sense of MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 and thus requiring investigation. Specific reasoning:\n\n- if (commit->off + dsize > commit->end): This controlling expression depends on commit->off, dsize and commit->end, which are runtime values (dsize is computed from the function parameter tag). It is not an invariant constant expression.\n\n- if (!(tag & 0x80000000)): Although tag is not modified inside the function, it is a runtime parameter (not a compile-time constant). An if-statement is evaluated once; MISRA 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions that cause loops or selections to be constant at runtime (e.g., while(1) or if(1)). This check is a normal runtime branch and is not an invariant controlling expression violation.\n\n- for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < dsize-sizeof(tag); i++): The loop condition uses the loop variable i, so the controlling expression changes as the loop iterates. While the upper bound dsize - sizeof(tag) is invariant for the loop body, the overall controlling expression is not invariant (its truth value changes with i), so it does not violate Rule 14.3. The usage of sizeof(tag) and unsigned types does not by itself make the controlling expression invariant.\n\n- No do-while or while loops with constant controlling expressions are present.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3; therefore I report no suspicious fragments."
