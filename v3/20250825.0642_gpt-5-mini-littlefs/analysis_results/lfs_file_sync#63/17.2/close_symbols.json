  "explanation": "- lfs_mlist_isopen: Direct callee of lfs_file_sync. Must be inspected to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call back to lfs_file_sync, which would create recursion.\n- lfs_file_sync_: Direct callee of lfs_file_sync. This is the primary candidate for an indirect recursion path; its body must be examined.\n- lfs_file_flush: Listed as a callee of lfs_file_sync_. Any callee of lfs_file_sync_ can participate in an indirect cycle back to lfs_file_sync and therefore must be checked.\n- lfs_pair_isnull: Callee of lfs_file_sync_. Included for the same transitive-cycle reason.\n- lfs_bd_sync: Callee of lfs_file_sync_. Included because it could call back (directly or via other functions) to lfs_file_sync.\n- lfs_ctz_tole32: Callee of lfs_file_sync_. Included to rule out any path from here back to lfs_file_sync.\n- lfs_dir_commit: Callee of lfs_file_sync_. Included because it could be part of an indirect call chain leading back to lfs_file_sync.\n- lfs_file_close_: Known caller of lfs_file_sync_. It must be checked because a cycle could be formed like lfs_file_sync -> lfs_file_sync_ -> ... -> lfs_file_close_ -> lfs_file_sync, which would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nIn short: include all direct callees of lfs_file_sync and all transitive callees of lfs_file_sync_ plus any functions that call lfs_file_sync_ (here lfs_file_close_) so the next analyzer can determine whether any path leads back to lfs_file_sync (directly or indirectly)."
