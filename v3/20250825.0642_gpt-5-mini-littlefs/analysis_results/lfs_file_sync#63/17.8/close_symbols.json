  "explanation": "To check MISRA rule (function parameter shall not be modified) we must inspect any called macros/functions or types that could (a) expand to assignments to the parameter identifiers (lfs or file) or (b) are macros that have side-effects. Explanations:\n- LFS_LOCK: a macro (or inline) used with lfs->cfg; macro expansion could assign to or rebind the parameter identifier(s). Verify its definition has no assignments to the function parameters.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (may be a macro with side-effects or assignments).\n- LFS_TRACE: typically a logging macro \u2014 could be defined to evaluate or even modify arguments in strange builds. Need its definition to ensure it does not assign to parameter names.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macros can expand into code with side-effects; inspect to confirm it doesn't modify parameters.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called with (struct lfs_mlist*)file. If this is a macro (or inline), its expansion could modify the local parameter variable; inspect its definition/expansion. Also needed to confirm it does not rely on or mutate the parameter identifier.\n- lfs_file_sync_: although normally a separate function (cannot reassign caller parameters), confirm it is not a macro/inline that expands into code modifying the parameter identifiers in this translation unit.\n- lfs_t: definition of the lfs_t type (and its fields like cfg, mlist) may be used inside macros; needed to understand how macros access fields and whether they might modify pointer parameters.\n- lfs_file_t: definition of the file type \u2014 needed for the same reasons as lfs_t (and to check whether file is a macro or typedef that could hide side-effects).\n- struct lfs_mlist: the cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file is used; need its definition in case macros access members that could cause side-effects tied to the parameter identifier.\n\nIn short, verify macro definitions and type declarations to ensure no macro expansion or hidden inline code assigns to the parameter variables 'lfs' or 'file' inside lfs_file_sync."
