The second parameter should be const-qualified (const lfs_gstate_t *src) to indicate it is not modified. Note: the call site alone cannot prove the violation \u2014 the violation depends on the function\u2019s parameter declarations/behavior.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not provably correct from the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 wants pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible \u2014 that means a function parameter that points to data it does not modify should be declared with a const-qualified pointee. If lfs_gstate_xor is declared as void lfs_gstate_xor(lfs_gstate_t *dst, lfs_gstate_t *src) but the implementation does not modify *src, then that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should instead be void lfs_gstate_xor(lfs_gstate_t *dst, const lfs_gstate_t *src). However, the call sites in lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (lfs_gstate_xor(&delta, &lfs->gdisk) and lfs_gstate_xor(&delta, &lfs->gstate)) do not by themselves prove a violation \u2014 the violation depends on the function's prototype/implementation. Therefore Agent A\u2019s reasoning about the potential violation is correct, but the report that this code (by itself) violates Rule 8.13 is not proven."
