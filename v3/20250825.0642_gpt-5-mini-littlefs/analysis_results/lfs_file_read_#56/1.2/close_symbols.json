  "explanation": "For checking language-extension usage you must inspect any macros, typedefs, struct definitions and called functions that the target function uses or expands to. Specifically:\n- LFS_ASSERT: It is a macro and may expand to compiler extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, __builtin_*, or compound literals). Must see its definition to detect such extensions.\n- LFS_O_RDONLY: The flag macro value/definition may use non\u2011standard token pasting or attributes; also needed to confirm it is a plain integer constant (no extension).\n- LFS_F_WRITING: Same reason as LFS_O_RDONLY (ensure no extension in definition or use of compiler-specific constructs).\n- LFS_READONLY: Conditional compilation symbol; its definition/usage may rely on compiler-specific pragmas or extension-specific conditionals. Need to see how it is defined/used in headers.\n- lfs_ssize_t and lfs_size_t: Typedefs may be defined using compiler-specific integer types (e.g. __int128, long long in non\u2011standard ways) or via macros that use extensions. Inspect typedefs to ensure only standard C types are used.\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: The structures may contain anonymous unions/structs, bit\u2011fields with implementation-defined widths, packed/aligned attributes, or other compiler extensions. Must inspect their definitions.\n- (lfs_file_t).flags (member): The code accesses file->flags; need the exact type/definition of this member (macro, enum, bitfield) to ensure no extension (e.g. bit\u2011field using implementation\u2011specific types or unusual attributes).\n- lfs_file_flush (prototype + implementation): The call appears inside the target under conditional compilation and its prototype/implementation may use GCC/clang extensions (attributes, statement expressions, builtins) or return types that are compiler\u2011specific. Inspect to ensure no extension is being pulled into the target by inlining/macros.\n- lfs_file_flushedread (prototype + implementation): The return of the target simply forwards to this function; its prototype/implementation could contain extensions (attributes, inline asm, macros) that affect the target or the build.\n- relevant public header(s) (e.g. lfs.h): The header(s) that define the above symbols often contain macro helpers, compiler detection blocks, or portability shims that introduce extensions (e.g. macro wrappers around __attribute__, inline, packed, section). Inspect those headers to find any use of language extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations where applicable) lets the next analyzer determine whether any of the macros, typedefs, struct members or called functions introduce compiler-specific language extensions that would cause the target function to violate the MISRA rule."
