Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for MISRA for-loop well-formedness analysis:\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Direct callee from the target. We must inspect its body for any for-loops and check their 3 clauses, loop counters, and whether the target\u2019s calls to it create loop-body side effects.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: Direct callee and the function returned by the target. Its implementation must be inspected for for-loops (including nested calls it makes) because the behaviour of any for-loop in called functions counts toward compliance.\n\n- lfs_cache_drop, lfs_file_flushedwrite, lfs_bd_flush, lfs_file_relocate, lfs_max: Callees of lfs_file_flush (from the static call graph). Each may contain for-loops or modify objects that could be used as loop counters in enclosing loops; their bodies must be checked.\n\n- lfs_min, lfs_ctz_find, lfs_dir_getread, lfs_bd_read: Callees of lfs_file_flushedread (from the static call graph). These must be examined for for-loops and for modifications to objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\n- LFS_READONLY: Conditional compilation macro used in the target; whether the flush branch exists depends on this macro. To know which callees are actually in the compiled code and which loops must be analyzed, the macro value is required.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Macro used in the target. Its expansion could contain expressions or statements (rarely loops, but could affect side effects); include to confirm it does not introduce a for-loop or persistent side-effects relevant to loop counters.\n\n- LFS_O_RDONLY, LFS_F_WRITING: Flag macros/enum values tested in the target. They determine control flow into the flush branch; needed to know if that branch (and its loops) is active and whether flag variables are used or modified by loops.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t: Type definitions for the lfs context and file handle. Needed to understand fields (e.g., file->flags) that are tested/modified and to determine whether any for-loop in callees uses these objects as loop counters or modifies them.\n\n- lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: Integer typedefs used for buffer/size and function return types. Loop counters and their types must be checked against MISRA rules (single counter type, no side effects); knowing these typedefs helps determine if loops use appropriate scalar types or aliasing.\n\nNotes: The static-call subtree rooted at the target must be fully inspected for any for-statements (including in nested callees). The listed symbols cover the direct callees and one-level callees shown in the static call graph plus macros and types that affect control flow and object usage relevant to loop counters and side-effects. If further recursion (additional callees reachable from these functions) exists in the codebase, those functions should also be added and inspected similarly."
