  "explanation": "You must inspect all functions reachable from lfs_file_read_ to determine whether any of them (directly or indirectly) call the C library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. For each symbol:\n- lfs_file_flush: direct callee of lfs_file_read_. Must be checked for any memcmp usage or for calls to other helpers that might use memcmp.\n- lfs_file_flushedread: direct callee/return target. Inspect for memcmp usage in its implementation.\n- lfs_cache_drop: callee of lfs_file_flush. Could contain memcmp calls comparing cached keys/strings.\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: callee of lfs_file_flush. May perform comparisons when writing metadata/names.\n- lfs_bd_flush: callee of lfs_file_flush. Block-device level routines sometimes compare buffers.\n- lfs_file_relocate: callee of lfs_file_flush. Relocation code may compare directory or name fields.\n- lfs_max: callee listed by lfs_file_flush (likely macro/inline). Include to ensure any inline comparison is examined.\n- lfs_min: callee of lfs_file_flushedread (likely macro/inline). Include to check for inline use of memcmp.\n- lfs_ctz_find: callee of lfs_file_flushedread. Include because it may manipulate bitmaps or keys and could use memcmp.\n- lfs_dir_getread: callee of lfs_file_flushedread. Directory-reading routines are the most likely place to compare filenames (potential null\u2011terminated strings) with memcmp \u2014 must be inspected closely.\n- lfs_bd_read: callee of lfs_file_flushedread. Block read routines may compare buffers or keys; include to be safe.\n- memcmp: the standard library function the MISRA rule targets. You must search for uses of memcmp in the above functions (and inspect the arguments at each call site) to determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nInspecting the source (and any inline definitions/macros) of these symbols lets you locate any memcmp calls reachable from lfs_file_read_ and determine whether the arguments are null\u2011terminated strings, which is required to decide MISRA compliance."
