  "explanation": "To decide whether the 'buffer' parameter in lfs_file_read_ should be const (MISRA: pointers should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) we must determine whether data is written into that buffer. The following symbols are required:\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: Direct callee of lfs_file_read_. Its prototype and implementation will show whether 'buffer' is used as an output destination (written to) or only read. If it writes into buffer, the pointer must not be const.\n\n- lfs_bd_read: Low-level block device read routine that flushedread normally calls to read bytes into memory. Its signature (e.g. whether it takes void *buffer or const void *) and implementation confirm whether it writes into the supplied buffer.\n\n- lfs_dir_getread: Helper function used by lfs_file_flushedread (per the call graph). It may perform reads into an application buffer or into an internal buffer then copy; its prototype/behavior can affect whether the original buffer is modified.\n\n- lfs_ctz_find and lfs_min: Utility functions/macros used in lfs_file_flushedread's control flow and size calculations. While they do not themselves write to user buffers, seeing their usage in flushedread helps understand code paths that lead to calls that write into 'buffer' (e.g. computed chunk sizes and offsets). Including them prevents missing a code path where buffer is passed to a writer.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: Type definitions for the parameters and return types. These are needed to fully interpret function prototypes (e.g. whether buffer is declared as void * or const void *, and sizes/offsets used when writing).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser trace whether 'buffer' is passed to routines that modify memory (thus must remain non-const) or is only read (in which case it should be declared const)."
