  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is syntactically invariant (i.e. a compile-time constant) and thus none need further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Details:\n\n- LFS_ASSERT((file->flags & LFS_O_RDONLY) == LFS_O_RDONLY): The expression depends on the runtime value file->flags; it is not a constant controlling an if/while/do/switch in the source. The assert macro expands to a runtime check (and may be omitted when NDEBUG is defined), so it does not represent an invariant controlling statement in the sense of Rule 14.3.\n\n- #ifndef LFS_READONLY / conditional compilation: Preprocessor conditionals are outside the scope of C controlling expressions checked by Rule 14.3 (which concerns runtime controlling expressions like if/while/for/do/switch), so this is not relevant.\n\n- if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING): This depends on the runtime value of file->flags and is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- if (err) { return err; }: err is assigned from lfs_file_flush at runtime immediately before the if; the controlling expression is not a compile-time constant.\n\nNo other if/while/do/switch controlling expressions exist in the function. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation under Rule 14.3."
