  "explanation": "I found no statements in lfs_file_read_ that assign to or otherwise modify the function parameters (lfs, file, buffer, size) themselves. Specific reasoning:\n\n- LFS_ASSERT((file->flags & LFS_O_RDONLY) == LFS_O_RDONLY): This reads file->flags for the test only; it does not assign to file or file->flags. The macro expands to assert(test), which does not modify the parameter.\n- if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING): This uses a bitwise read of file->flags to decide the branch; no modification of the parameter occurs.\n- int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file); and return lfs_file_flushedread(lfs, file, buffer, size);: These are function calls that pass the pointer parameters to other functions. Per the rule, the objects pointed to by pointer parameters may be modified by called functions, but the pointer variables in the current function must not be changed. In the shown code there are no assignments that change the pointer variables (no statements like file = ..., buffer = ..., lfs = ..., size = ...).\n- return err; and other local variable usage: these are local and do not modify parameters.\n\nBecause there are no assignments or other operations that alter the parameter variables in this function, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
