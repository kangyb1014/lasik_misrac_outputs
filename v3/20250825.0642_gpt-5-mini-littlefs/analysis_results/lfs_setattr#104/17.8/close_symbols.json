  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_setattr itself violates the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified, the analyzer must see any code that could write to the parameter identifiers (lfs, path, type, buffer, size) within the body. The following symbols are required for that verification:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked at the start as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or an inline function) it might expand to code that assigns to local identifiers or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (for example via side-effecting macros). The exact definition is required to confirm it does not assign to lfs (or any other parameter) or otherwise modify parameter variables.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Similar to LFS_LOCK, this macro/function is called later. Its definition is needed to ensure it does not modify any of the function's parameter variables when expanded or called.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro takes the parameters (including (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size). As a macro it could conceivably evaluate or assign to those arguments (or shadow/modify parameter names). The definition is needed to confirm it does not perform assignments to the parameter identifiers.\n\n- lfs_setattr_: Although this is a normal callee (per the call graph), the analyzer should see its declaration/definition to rule out that the name is actually a macro or inline expansion that could modify the caller's parameter variables (macros can). Also seeing its prototype confirms that the call passes values (not addresses of the caller's parameter variables) so the callee cannot change the caller's parameter objects.\n\n- lfs_t: The type definition (struct lfs_t) is required so the analyzer can reason about the expression lfs->cfg used in LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). While reading a member does not normally modify the pointer, the struct definition helps confirm there are no unusual macros/overloads or member-access tricks that could have side effects and ensures correct parsing of LFS_LOCK argument.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer inspect any macro expansions or inline code reachable from lfs_setattr that might write to the parameter names (or take their addresses and allow modification). Without them you cannot be certain that a macro or inlined callee doesn't modify the parameters, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
