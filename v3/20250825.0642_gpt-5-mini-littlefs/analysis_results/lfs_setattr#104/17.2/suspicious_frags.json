  "explanation": "I did not find any direct self-calls (no function body contains a call to the same function name). The remaining code fragments that are not listed are simple operations (size checks, assignments, tag/id handling, return statements, and trace/logging macros) and do not introduce recursion by themselves. The duplicate lfs_commitattr block is identical and likewise contains only calls that are already listed above. The listed fragments are the call sites where an indirect recursive cycle could originate (i.e., calls from one function into another); those call sites should be inspected because the definitions of the called functions (not provided here) could potentially call back into these functions and create indirect recursion. Other fragments are purely non-calling logic and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
