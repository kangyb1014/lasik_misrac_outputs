  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- No GCC/clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm, __extension__, __typeof__, or statement-expressions ({ ... }) are present.\n- No inline assembly or compiler-specific pragmas are used.\n- The variadic macro LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) and use of __VA_ARGS__ are standard C99 features (not a compiler extension). The empty replacement for LFS_TRACE (when tracing is disabled) is also valid in C99/C11.\n- The comma operator used in LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0) is standard C, not an extension.\n- Use of fixed-width integer types (uint8_t, uint32_t) and the inttypes macros (PRIu8, PRIu32) are standard C99/C11 functionality, not compiler-specific extensions.\n\nGiven the absence of any compiler-specific tokens or constructs, there are no fragments that warrant further investigation for Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you target a pre-C99 compiler, note that variadic macros and inttypes/stdint features require C99; if that is a concern, specify the exact compiler/standard so I can re-evaluate against that constraint."
