  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is \"if (err)\", where err is assigned from the call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) immediately beforehand, so the controlling expression depends on a variable value and is not a compile-time or loop-invariant constant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or other control statements with constant expressions. The LFS_TRACE and LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_LOCK macros do not introduce controlling expressions in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
