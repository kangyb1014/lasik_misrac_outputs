  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Reasons why other fragments do not need investigation: \n\n- The fixed-width integer types (uint32_t, uint8_t) and size_t are standard C types provided by the C standard headers (stdint.h, stddef.h) \u2014 their use is not an extension.  \n- The static const array defined inside the function is standard C (local static objects are allowed).  \n- The implicit conversion from void* (buffer) to pointer to object type (const uint8_t *) is standard C and does not require a cast.  \n- Bitwise operations, shifts, XOR, array indexing, and the for-loop with size_t are standard C constructs.  \n- The trailing comma in the initializer list is permitted by the C standard.  \n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, inline variants that are non-standard, or other vendor-specific tokens).  \n\nGiven the absence of any of the above extension constructs, there are no code fragments that need to be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions)."
