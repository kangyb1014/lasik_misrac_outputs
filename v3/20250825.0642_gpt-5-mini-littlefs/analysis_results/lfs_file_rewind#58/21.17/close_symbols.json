  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: The direct helper called by the target. You must inspect its body to see whether it calls any string.h functions and how it computes buffer pointers/lengths that might cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n- lfs_file_seek_: Shown in the static call graph as called by lfs_file_rewind_. Seek/position logic commonly manipulates buffer pointers and lengths; its implementation may call string.h functions or compute sizes/offsets that affect their arguments.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type. Its members (e.g. config pointers, block/cache sizes) can determine buffer sizes and limits used when manipulating memory \u2014 needed to verify bounds passed to string functions.\n- lfs_file_t: The file object type. You need the exact members (position, size, internal buffer pointers, available lengths, flags) to determine whether any memory/string operations use valid ranges.\n- lfs_config (type of lfs->cfg) and filesystem internals: Configuration parameters (buffer sizes, block size, read/write cache size) affect maximum/valid memory ranges; macros or functions may read these to compute lengths passed to string.h functions.\n- definitions of file internals (members of lfs_file_t used by the called functions): To check that pointers/lengths passed into memcpy/strncpy/etc. are within the bounds of the referenced objects you must know the object layouts and capacity fields.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros: While these are synchronization helpers, they can expand to code (or wrappers) that reference configuration or buffer objects; include them to ensure no hidden string.h usage or side effects change buffer lifetimes/validity.\n- LFS_TRACE macro: Logging macros can expand to string handling (snprintf/strcat/strlen) or create temporary buffers; include their definitions to rule out indirect string.h use or unintended uses of object pointers in logging.\n- Any standard <string.h> functions or wrappers used inside lfs_file_rewind_ / lfs_file_seek_ (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): To apply the MISRA rule you must find all occurrences of these functions (or thin wrappers) in the implementations and examine the pointer/length arguments to verify they cannot access out-of-bounds memory.\n- Any other callees of lfs_file_seek_ (transitive callees): String/buffer manipulation may occur deeper in the call chain. Include the bodies/prototypes of any transitive callees so the full dataflow of pointers and lengths can be analyzed for potential out-of-bounds uses.\n\nProvide the full source (or prototypes and struct definitions) for each listed symbol so the analyzer can trace pointer/length computation and every use of <string.h> functions to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
