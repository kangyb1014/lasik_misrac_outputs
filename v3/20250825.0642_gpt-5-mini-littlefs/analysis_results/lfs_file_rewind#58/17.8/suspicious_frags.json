  "explanation": "No code in the provided lfs_file_rewind function modifies the formal parameters lfs or file. There are no assignments, increments/decrements, or re-bindings of those parameters. The macros used are defined as no-ops that do not perform assignments (LFS_LOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg,0), LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) to ((void)cfg), and LFS_TRACE is empty), so their expansions do not modify the parameter pointers. The call to lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file) passes the pointers by value \u2014 any modifications inside that callee affect only its own parameters, not the caller\u2019s lfs or file variables. Dereferencing lfs (e.g., lfs->cfg) only accesses members and, as shown, is not assigned to. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
