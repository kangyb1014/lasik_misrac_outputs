  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: The target directly forwards work to this internal implementation; any use of memcmp that could violate the MISRA rule is likely to appear here. Inspecting its body is required.\n- lfs_file_seek_: The static call graph shows lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_. memcmp usage that compares strings may be in this callee (or passed-through data), so its body must be analyzed.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is about use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. You must locate direct calls to memcmp (or obvious aliases) to determine whether the arguments are C strings \u2014 include the memcmp symbol to search for and inspect call sites.\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: Definitions of these types are needed to determine the nature of buffers/fields passed into memcmp (e.g., whether a pointer refers to a null-terminated string). Knowing field types and semantics is necessary to decide if a memcmp call violates the rule.\n\nNote: If lfs_file_rewind_ or lfs_file_seek_ call additional functions (or use macros) that might wrap memcmp, include those symbols as well when discovered; they are also relevant to deciding a violation."
