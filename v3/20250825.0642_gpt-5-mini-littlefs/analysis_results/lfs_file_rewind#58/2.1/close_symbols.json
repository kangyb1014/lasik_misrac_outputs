  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function governs the early-return path (err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). Its definition may itself contain a return, longjmp, infinite loop, or other control-flow effects that would make the subsequent code unreachable, so its expansion/implementation must be inspected.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although called at the end, its definition could also affect control flow (e.g. non-returning behavior). To determine reachability of the final return and any code after calls, include its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro may be a no-op, but it could also expand to code that affects flow (e.g. abort, longjmp, or return). Its expansion must be checked to be sure the trace calls do not render later lines unreachable.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: The called helper produces the central path through the function. If lfs_file_rewind_ never returns (exit/longjmp/infinite loop) or always returns before certain points, that will change whether the code after the call is reachable; therefore its implementation is required.\n- lfs_file_seek_: lfs_file_rewind_ statically calls lfs_file_seek_. If lfs_file_rewind_\u2019s reachable behavior depends on callees that may not return or may alter control flow, those implementations must be inspected as well (starting with lfs_file_seek_)."
