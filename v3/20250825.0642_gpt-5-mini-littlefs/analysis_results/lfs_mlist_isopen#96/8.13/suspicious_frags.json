  "explanation": "Only pointer-related constructs can violate MISRA C:8.13. The rest of the function contains simple control flow and boolean returns with no additional pointer usage. The three reported fragments cover (a) the function parameters (pointer types passed in), (b) the pointer-to-pointer loop control (declaration and update expression), and (c) the explicit cast in the comparison which can remove const qualification. There are no other pointer declarations or operations in the function that would be relevant to Rule 8.13, so no other fragments need investigation."
