  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Both parameters (head and node) are only read: head is not assigned to (only its address is taken to initialize a local pointer-to-pointer p), and node is only compared against *p. The loop updates the local variable p (and then takes addresses of next fields), but there are no assignments to head or node, nor any writes through &head that would alter the parameter. The cast (struct lfs_mlist*)node is a harmless redundant cast. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
