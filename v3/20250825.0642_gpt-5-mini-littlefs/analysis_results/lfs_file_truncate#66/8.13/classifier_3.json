  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment only passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK; there is no pointer declaration here that should be const-qualified. In this context cfg is likely a mutable object used for locking/unlocking, so it must be non-const. (A violation would only be present if the cfg object is never modified by any operation and could have been declared as a pointer to const, but that cannot be determined from this fragment.)"
