  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: both parameters lfs and file are non-const (lfs_t * and lfs_file_t *), so casting them to (void*) does not remove const-qualification. However, a violation would occur if the pointers were const-qualified and this cast removed the qualifier. Example violating scenario: if the function had const lfs_t *lfs or const lfs_file_t *file and the code did LFS_TRACE(\"...\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file) \u2014 that cast would drop const and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
