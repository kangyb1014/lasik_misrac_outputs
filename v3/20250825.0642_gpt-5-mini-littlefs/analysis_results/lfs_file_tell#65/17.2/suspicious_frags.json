  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that exhibit direct or indirect self-calls (recursion) and therefore nothing to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Specific checks performed:\n\n- lfs_file_tell: calls lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file). This is a distinct function, not a recursive call. The called function is defined below and does not call lfs_file_tell or any other function that would call back into lfs_file_tell.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_: static function body is \"(void)lfs; return file->pos;\" \u2014 it makes no function calls at all, so no recursion (direct or indirect) can occur through it.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: implemented as an iterative for-loop that walks the list via pointer updates. It does not call itself (no recursive call) and does not call any function that could call back into it.\n\n- Macros and other symbols (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_ASSERT) either expand to no-ops, simple expressions, or assert(), none of which introduce calls back into the functions under review. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other indirect call mechanisms in the provided code that could create indirect recursion.\n\n- The cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file used in the assert is a type cast only and does not imply any call or recursion.\n\nGiven these points, there are no suspicious fragments related to Rule 17.2 in the provided code."
