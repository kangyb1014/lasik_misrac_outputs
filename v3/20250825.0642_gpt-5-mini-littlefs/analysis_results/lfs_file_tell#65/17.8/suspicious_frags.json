  "explanation": "I inspected all provided fragments: lfs_file_tell, lfs_file_tell_, lfs_mlist_isopen, and the related macros (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_ASSERT). None of these assign to any function parameter identifier (no occurrences of \"lfs =\", \"file =\", \"head =\", or \"node =\"), so no pointer parameter itself is being modified. The code only: - dereferences pointer parameters to read members (e.g., file->pos, lfs->mlist), which is permitted (the pointed-to object may be modified, but here it is only read), - casts parameters to void to silence unused warnings, - passes parameters to other functions or macros, - and in lfs_mlist_isopen takes the address of the local parameter head to create a local pointer-to-pointer (p) but never writes through p to modify head or node. The macros expand to expressions that do not alter their cfg/parameter arguments. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the supplied code."
