  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function lfs_file_tell and all related code fragments. There are no calls to the C standard library function memcmp anywhere in the supplied code. The routines and macros shown perform pointer checks, return a stored file position, or expand to no-ops/void expressions: \n- lfs_mlist_isopen compares pointers in a linked list (no string operations).\n- lfs_file_tell_ simply returns file->pos (no string operations).\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_ASSERT, and LFS_TRACE expand to simple expressions or macros that do not call memcmp or perform string comparisons.\n- The only formatted output use is the PRId32 macro inside LFS_TRACE (which is a numeric format macro, not a string comparison).\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings). If there are other source files or omitted functions, those should be searched for memcmp (or strcmp/strncmp used inappropriately) \u2014 but within the supplied code there are no suspicious fragments."
