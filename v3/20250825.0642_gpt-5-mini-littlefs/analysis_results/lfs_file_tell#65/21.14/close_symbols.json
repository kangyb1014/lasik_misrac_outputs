  "explanation": "- lfs_mlist_isopen: This is a direct callee of lfs_file_tell. If memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings it is most likely to appear in this helper (e.g., comparing file names or identifiers). Provide the full function body so the analyser can detect any memcmp usage or string comparisons.\n- lfs_file_tell_: This is the other direct callee whose implementation determines the returned value. Although unlikely to use memcmp for NUL\u2011terminated strings, its definition must be inspected for any indirect memcmp usage.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These macros or functions wrap locking semantics (used at the start/end of the function). They may expand to helper functions or macros that could contain/introduce calls to memcmp or other standard library usage; include their definitions to be sure no memcmp is hidden there.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros sometimes evaluate expressions or call debug helpers; its expansion could contain code that uses memcmp (or diagnostics that compare strings). Include its macro expansion/definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/logging macros may format or compare strings internally; include its definition to ensure no memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings is invoked via logging.\n\nProvide the full source (or preprocessor expansions) for each listed symbol so the next agent can reliably determine whether memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in the target call chain."
