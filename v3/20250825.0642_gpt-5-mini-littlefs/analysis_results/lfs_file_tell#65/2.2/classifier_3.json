  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_tell:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_tell:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n    return file->pos;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The LFS_TRACE macro is defined as an empty macro, so the statement LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res); expands to nothing and generates no executable code. Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour; since this trace call does not produce an executed operation, it is not dead code. (If LFS_TRACE were defined to produce executed code with no effect, that would violate Rule 2.2.)"
