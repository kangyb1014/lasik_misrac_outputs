  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_open calls itself (directly or indirectly) you must inspect all functions (and macros that expand to calls) reachable from it:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called directly by lfs_file_open; it must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call back to lfs_file_open.\n- lfs_file_open_: called directly by lfs_file_open; its entire call chain must be inspected for any path back to lfs_file_open.\n- lfs_file_opencfg_: called by lfs_file_open_ (per the static graph). It and its transitive callees must be checked for any path returning to lfs_file_open.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: invoked at start/end of lfs_file_open (likely macros or wrappers). They could expand to or call functions that (indirectly) call lfs_file_open, so they must be inspected.\n- LFS_TRACE and LFS_ASSERT: logging/assertion macros/functions used in lfs_file_open. Although unlikely, they could expand to code that calls functions which lead back to lfs_file_open; include them to be safe.\n\nIn short, any symbol that lfs_file_open invokes directly (and the transitive closure of their callees) must be examined to prove absence of direct or indirect recursion; the list above is the immediate set required to start that analysis."
