  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The value assigned to err comes from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To decide whether the controlling expression if (err) can be invariant we must inspect the LFS_LOCK implementation/macro (return value, side-effects, dependence on lfs->cfg).\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although not used as a controlling expression here, its macro/implementation must be checked for any hidden control statements introduced by the macro expansion that could contain invariant controlling expressions.\\n- LFS_ASSERT: This macro may expand to an if/conditional or other control construct. MISRA checks require examining the expansion to see whether it introduces a controlling expression and whether that expression is invariant.\\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace macros often expand to conditional calls (e.g. if (TRACE_ENABLED) ...). The macro expansion must be inspected for any controlling expressions and whether they are invariant.\\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: This function is the operand of LFS_ASSERT(!lfs_mlist_isopen(...)). To determine whether that asserted condition is an invariant (and whether the ASSERT expansion yields an invariant controlling expression) we must know what lfs_mlist_isopen returns and whether its result can vary.\\n- lfs_t (definition / members, specifically cfg): The argument passed into LFS_LOCK is lfs->cfg; the type and semantics of lfs->cfg (and any constness or compile-time-constant properties of lfs_t) are needed to determine if LFS_LOCK can legitimately produce a non-varying result.\n\nProvide these macro/function definitions and the lfs_t structure to the next analyzer so it can expand macros and reason about whether any controlling expressions in this function are effectively invariant."
