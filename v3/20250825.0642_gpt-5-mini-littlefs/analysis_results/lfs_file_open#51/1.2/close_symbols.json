  "explanation": "You must inspect the listed symbols because the target function itself is thin and delegates behavior to macros, types and called functions; any compiler-specific language extensions used by those symbols would cause the target to violate the MISRA rule. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are invoked directly in the function. They are frequently macros that can expand to compiler builtins, inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__ annotations, or compiler-specific synchronization primitives. Inspecting their definitions is necessary to detect any explicit compiler extensions.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: A logging macro that may be variadic or expand to helper functions/macros that use compiler extensions (e.g. __FUNCTION__, __builtin_* calls, statement-expressions, attributes). Its definition must be checked for extension usage.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros commonly expand to compiler intrinsics (e.g. __builtin_trap), attributes, or statement-expressions. Verify its expansion to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: The typedefs/structs may include compiler-specific extensions (packed attributes, alignment attributes, flexible-array/zero-length-array usage in non-standard ways, or __attribute__ annotations). You need their definitions to check for such extensions.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: The code casts to (struct lfs_mlist*) before calling lfs_mlist_isopen. The struct definition is needed to ensure the cast and use do not rely on non-standard extension types or attributes.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen and lfs_file_open_: Their declarations or definitions must be inspected for function-level extensions (e.g. GCC __attribute__ annotations, use of typeof in parameter lists, nested functions, or other compiler-specific syntax). Even if the target function calls them, extensions in their declarations/definitions can mean the overall codebase uses extensions.\n\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg: LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg; the cfg type definition may itself use compiler extensions or macros that expand with extensions. It must be checked because the macros operating on it may hide extension usage.\n\nIn short, examine the expansions/definitions of the above macros, the involved types, and the called-function declarations/definitions to determine if any language/compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expression ({...}), inline assembler, nested functions, nonstandard keywords) are used. Only by checking these symbols can you reliably decide whether the target function violates the MISRA rule against language extensions."
