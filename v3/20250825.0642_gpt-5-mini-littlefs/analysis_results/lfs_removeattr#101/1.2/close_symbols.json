  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_removeattr uses any compiler language extensions, the next analyzer must see the actual definitions/decls of all macros, types and called functions that could hide extensions. Provide:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: could be a macro or inline function that uses compiler extensions (__attribute__, __builtin_*, inline asm, statement-expressions, GCC label-as-value, etc.) or nonstandard semantics. Inspecting its definition is required to decide if an extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK (may use extensions in its implementation/definition).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: likely a macro wrapping printf-style tracing. Its definition must be checked for variadic-macro idioms (##__VA_ARGS__), use of compiler-specific builtin/attributes, nonstandard format handling, or other extensions.\n\n- lfs_removeattr_: the callee implementation/declaration may be declared with compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn)), __attribute__((format(...))) or use extensions that affect how the call is generated; include it to ensure no extension is implicitly used via the call.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): to inspect whether the type uses compiler extensions (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, packed/aligned attributes, typeof, anonymous structs/unions, or other nonstandard declarations).\n\n- type of lfs->cfg: the cfg member's type (lock/config object) definition is needed because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; the cfg type might itself be an extension or the macros may rely on extension-only members.\n\n- PRIu8 macro (from <inttypes.h>): the format uses \"%'\"PRIu8\"'\" token concatenation \u2014 check the exact macro expansion to confirm only standard macros are used and no compiler-specific format specifiers or concatenation tricks that rely on extensions.\n\n- uint8_t typedef (from <stdint.h>): ensure the fixed-width integer typedef is a standard typedef and that there are no typedefs/aliases or nonstandard width definitions introduced via extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macro definitions, typedefs and the callee) allows the next agent to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used directly in the target function or indirectly via macros/types it relies on."
