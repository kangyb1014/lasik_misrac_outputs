  "explanation": "I fixed the unterminated string literal that caused the compilation error by moving and concatenating the format pieces so the preprocessor concatenates the literal with PRIu8 correctly:\n- Changed the __probe_log ENTER call to use: \"... type=%\" PRIu8, so the string is valid.\n\nI also removed an unused local variable in __probe_dump_cfg_bytes (replaced it with (void)lfs_ptr;) to silence the unused-variable warning. No other logic was changed; all original logging, locking, tracing, and call sequence are preserved."
