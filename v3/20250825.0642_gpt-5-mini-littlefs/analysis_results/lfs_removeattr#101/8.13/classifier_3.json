  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: lfs->cfg is declared as const struct lfs_file_config *cfg, so the pointer already points to a const\u2011qualified type and Rule 8.13 is satisfied. (Note: if the LFS_LOCK macro/procedure were to accept a non\u2011const pointer or cast away the const and modify the pointed object, that would create a violation \u2014 but that is not evident from the shown fragment.)"
