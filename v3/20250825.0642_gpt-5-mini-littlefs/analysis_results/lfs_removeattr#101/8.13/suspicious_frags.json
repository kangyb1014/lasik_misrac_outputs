  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'path' is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const char *), so it complies with the rule; 'type' is a non-pointer scalar (uint8_t) and not relevant; local variable 'err' and the return statement do not involve pointer types. The only pointer-bearing expressions in the function are the lfs pointer and the use of lfs->cfg; these are included above because they may require const-qualification review (note: the provided additional code shows cfg has type 'const struct lfs_file_config *cfg'). All other lines are either non-pointer operations or already const-qualified and therefore not suspicious under Rule 8.13."
