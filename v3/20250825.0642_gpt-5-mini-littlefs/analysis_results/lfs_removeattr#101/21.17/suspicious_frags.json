  "explanation": "I found no uses of the string-handling functions from <string.h> in the provided code fragments. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically targets calls such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn. None of these (or other <string.h> functions) appear in: - lfs_removeattr (only calls LFS_LOCK, LFS_TRACE, lfs_removeattr_, LFS_UNLOCK) - lfs_removeattr_ (calls lfs_commitattr) - lfs_commitattr (calls lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit and uses macros LFS_MKATTRS/LFS_MKTAG but does not call any <string.h> functions) Notes: - The LFS_TRACE invocation uses a \"%s\" format to print path. That invokes formatted output, not any function from <string.h>, so it is outside the scope of Rule 21.17. If concern exists about reading beyond a non-terminated path string, that is a different class of issue (formatted output/termination), not this specific MISRA rule. - Passing path (const char *) through lfs_dir_find/other helpers may involve pointer manipulation, but no <string.h> calls are present here. - The buffer/size parameters passed to lfs_dir_commit do not indicate any direct use of the <string.h> API in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA Rule 21.17."
