  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_removeattr modifies any of its parameters (lfs, path, type) you must inspect any code that is expanded or executed in the context of this function: - LFS_LOCK: could be a macro that expands into code which assigns to the argument expression or to identifiers in the caller; need its definition to verify it does not assign to the parameter variable 'lfs' or 'path' textually. - LFS_UNLOCK: same reasons as LFS_LOCK (may be a macro with side-effects that could modify caller identifiers). - LFS_TRACE: commonly a macro that expands to logging code; it could (if poorly written) contain assignments or use the parameter names in ways that modify them. Inspect its definition to ensure no assignments to parameter identifiers. - lfs_removeattr_: although shown as a callee, it might be a macro or inline that expands in the caller context; if it is a macro it could modify the caller's parameter variables. If it is a normal function it cannot change the caller's parameter variables, but you should verify whether it is a macro/inline or a normal function. - lfs_t definition: you need the struct/typedef to see what lfs->cfg refers to and to confirm that any modification performed by macros/functions targets the object pointed to (allowed) rather than the pointer variable itself (disallowed). Inspecting these symbols lets you determine whether any expansion or call in lfs_removeattr performs an assignment to the parameter identifiers (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
