  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function does not assign to or otherwise use any parameter as an lvalue: there are no statements such as lfs = ..., path = ..., or type = ...; the parameters are only dereferenced (lfs->cfg), cast ((void*)lfs), or passed to other functions/macros (lfs_removeattr_, LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE). Dereferencing the pointer to modify the pointed-to object is allowed by Rule 17.8; casting a pointer or passing it to another function does not modify the pointer variable itself. Therefore there are no occurrences in this function that appear to violate Rule 17.8. (If a reviewer wants to be extra thorough, they can inspect the definitions/expansions of the macros LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, and LFS_TRACE and the implementation of lfs_removeattr_ to confirm they do not assign to the local parameter identifiers, but based on the visible code there is no modification of the parameters.)"
