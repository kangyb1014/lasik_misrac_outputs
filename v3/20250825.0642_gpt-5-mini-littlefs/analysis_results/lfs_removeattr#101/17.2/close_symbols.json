  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_removeattr violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self\u2011calls you must inspect the complete call chain reachable from lfs_removeattr and any possible call targets introduced by macros or function pointers:\n\n- lfs_removeattr_: This is the direct callee shown in the static call graph. You must examine its body to see whether it calls lfs_removeattr (direct recursion) or calls other functions that eventually form a cycle back to lfs_removeattr.\n\n- lfs_commitattr: This is a callee of lfs_removeattr_. Since an indirect recursive cycle could pass through lfs_commitattr, you must inspect its implementation and its callees.\n\n- all functions called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_commitattr: Recursion may be indirect through several levels. You need the transitive closure of callees starting at lfs_commitattr to detect any path back to lfs_removeattr (or lfs_removeattr_).\n\n- any function-pointer targets referenced in lfs_removeattr_, lfs_commitattr, or their callees: Calls via function pointers are legitimate call edges for recursion detection. You must resolve/inspect those targets to ensure they do not introduce a cycle.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE (macro expansions / underlying functions): These macros may expand to function calls (or inline functions) that could, in theory, call back into the filesystem API. To be conservative, include their expansions or underlying functions in the analysis to ensure they do not introduce recursion.\n\nIn short, you need the full implementations (or accurate static call graph) of lfs_removeattr_, lfs_commitattr, every function they call transitively, any function-pointer targets they use, and the expansions/targets of the used macros to conclusively determine whether any call path returns to lfs_removeattr (directly or indirectly)."
