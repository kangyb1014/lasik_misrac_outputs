  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments (lfs_file_size, lfs_mlist_isopen, and lfs_file_size_). None of these fragments call memcmp or perform comparisons of null-terminated strings. lfs_mlist_isopen performs pointer equality checks while iterating a linked list; lfs_file_size and lfs_file_size_ perform numeric operations and flags checks; tracing macros (LFS_TRACE) use formatting but do not indicate use of memcmp. No inclusion or use of string.h or memcmp is present in the supplied code. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
