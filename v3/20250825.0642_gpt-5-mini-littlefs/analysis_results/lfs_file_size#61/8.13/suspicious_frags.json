  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not appear relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Specifically:\n- The LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) calls access/modify lfs configuration/state, implying the lfs pointer is used for mutation and therefore may legitimately be non-const.\n- LFS_TRACE usage that prints the result (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_size -> %\"PRIu32, res);) and the return statements operate on scalar/result values, not pointer types that could be const-qualified.\n- The return of err and simple local variable declarations do not involve passing object pointers that could be made const.\n- The rest of the function body either performs operations that likely require mutable access to lfs (locking/unlocking) or involve non-pointer data, so they need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 in this context.\n\nThe listed fragments are those that may conceal opportunities to use const-qualified pointer types (function parameters, casts to void*/other pointer types, and the forwarded call), and therefore warrant investigation."
