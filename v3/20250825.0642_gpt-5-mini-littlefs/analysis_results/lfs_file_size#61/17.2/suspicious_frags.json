  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they do not contain function calls that could form direct or indirect recursion. Specifically: - The body of lfs_file_size_ besides the lfs_max call is simple data access/returns ((void)lfs; return file->ctz.size) and contains no calls to lfs_file_size or other functions. - lfs_mlist_isopen performs an iterative loop over a linked list and contains no function calls (its control flow is purely iterative and returns a boolean), so it cannot be recursive. - Simple casts, variable declarations, and direct return statements in the provided snippets do not introduce calls and thus cannot create recursion. - The only direct function/macro calls in the provided code are those listed above; these are the reasonable locations to inspect for possible indirect recursion (including macro expansions such as LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE/LFS_ASSERT and the lfs_max call). No other fragments in the supplied code invoke functions that could participate in a recursive cycle with lfs_file_size/lfs_file_size_."
