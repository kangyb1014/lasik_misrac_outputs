  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension usage in lfs_file_size:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros or functions used for locking. Their definitions may use compiler extensions (statement expressions, attributes, inline assembly, typeof, builtins, or GCC/Clang specific attributes). Inspecting their bodies is required to determine if the target uses any language extensions via these lock macros.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace/log macros commonly expand to variadic macros, compiler-specific attributes, or inline functions that may use extensions (e.g., __builtin_printf, statement expressions, string literal concatenation with non-standard tokens). The expansion determines whether the call uses any language extensions.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro may use compiler extensions (like __attribute__, __builtin_unreachable, statement expressions). Its expansion must be inspected to rule out extensions.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although it is a plain calle\u00e9, its prototype and any macros around calling it (and the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*)file) may rely on non-standard declarations or types. Its declaration/definition should be checked for extensions (e.g., non-standard parameter attributes, inline assembly, or non-standard typedefs).\n\n- lfs_file_size_: This internal helper is called and returns lfs_soff_t; its declaration/definition must be checked for uses of language extensions (inline asm, compiler attributes, non-standard linkage, or extension-only constructs) that would affect the safety of analysis.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: The return type of the target function. The typedef could be an alias to a compiler-specific extended integer type (e.g., __int128) or use implementation-specific attributes. Check its definition for extensions.\n\n- lfs_t: The type of the first parameter; its definition is necessary because members accessed in macros (e.g., lfs->cfg) or their types could be extension types (bit-fields with unusual widths, attributes, or compiler-specific types).\n\n- lfs_file_t: The second parameter type; its definition is required to ensure the cast to struct lfs_mlist* and any use in macros do not rely on language extensions (anonymous structs, transparent unions, packed attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: The explicit cast in LFS_ASSERT uses this tag. Its definition may include non-standard features (anonymous structs/unions, bit-field extensions, attributes). Must inspect it to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- PRIu32: This macro (format specifier) expands to a string literal token. Its definition could rely on platform-specific headers or macros; while standard in C99/C11 via inttypes.h, some implementations redefine or use extensions. Check the actual macro used in the project to ensure no non-standard extension is being relied upon.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their declarations/definitions/expansions) is sufficient to determine whether lfs_file_size itself (through direct calls or macro expansions) uses any compiler language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
