First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of lfs_dir_find_match.\n```c\nstatic int lfs_dir_find_match(void *data,\n        lfs_tag_t tag, const void *buffer) {\n    struct lfs_dir_find_match *name = data;\n    lfs_t *lfs = name->lfs;\n    const struct lfs_diskoff *disk = buffer;\n\n    // compare with disk\n    lfs_size_t diff = lfs_min(name->size, lfs_tag_size(tag));\n    int res = lfs_bd_cmp(lfs,\n            NULL, &lfs->rcache, diff,\n            disk->block, disk->off, name->name, diff);\n    if (res != LFS_CMP_EQ) {\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    // only equal if our size is still the same\n    if (name->size != lfs_tag_size(tag)) {\n        return (name->size < lfs_tag_size(tag)) ?

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop 'for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff)' uses the object 'diff' in the third clause, but 'diff' is assigned inside the loop body (diff = lfs_min(...)). Clause 3 of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the loop body.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. The code that triggers the issue is the for loop in lfs_bd_cmp:\nfor (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff) { ... diff = lfs_min(size-i, sizeof(dat)); ... }\nThe third clause uses the object diff to update the loop counter, but diff is assigned inside the loop body. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (clause 3) forbids the third clause from using objects that are modified in the loop body. (Note: the target function lfs_dir_find_match itself contains no for loop; the offending loop is in lfs_bd_cmp called by it.)\nRecommendation: rewrite the loop to avoid using a body-modified object in the for increment (for example convert to a while loop where diff is computed inside the body and i updated there, or restructure so the increment expression depends only on the loop counter)."
