  "explanation": "The compilation error was caused by indexing into a void* (name->name[i]), which is invalid in C because pointer arithmetic on void* is not allowed. I fixed this by casting name->name to a const unsigned char* before indexing: ((const unsigned char*)name->name)[i]. This preserves the original logic while avoiding pointer-arithmetic-on-void and dereference errors."
