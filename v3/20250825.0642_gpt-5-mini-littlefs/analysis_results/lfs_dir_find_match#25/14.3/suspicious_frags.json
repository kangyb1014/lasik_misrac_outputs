  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale by control point:\n\n- lfs_dir_find_match: all conditionals (res != LFS_CMP_EQ, name->size != lfs_tag_size(tag)) depend on runtime values (results of lfs_bd_cmp and tag/size) and are not constant/invariant.\n\n- lfs_bd_cmp: the for-loop controlling expression (for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff)) is not invariant. The loop body assigns diff = lfs_min(size-i, sizeof(dat)) before the increment, so diff > 0 while i < size and i is advanced each iteration; if size == 0 the loop is not entered. The memcmp result affects early returns, so the loop will terminate or return. Therefore the controlling expression is not constant.\n\n- lfs_bd_read: the while (size > 0) loop is driven by the runtime value of size and multiple branches within the loop reduce size (size -= diff) or return errors. Each branch either decreases size, continues after reducing data/size/off, or performs a read that will enable subsequent reductions; thus the condition is not invariant. The various if conditions inside depend on runtime fields (pcache, rcache, hint, lfs->cfg values, block/off/size) and are not constant.\n\n- Other expressions (LFS_ASSERT, comparisons using lfs->block_count, bit-masks in lfs_tag_size) are evaluated from runtime state or macros and are not compile-time invariant controlling expressions.\n\nNo do-while false-constant or explicit infinite loops (while(1) etc.) are present that would fall under the rule exceptions. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 14.3."
