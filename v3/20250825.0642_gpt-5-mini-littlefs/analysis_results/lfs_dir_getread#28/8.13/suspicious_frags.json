  "explanation": "Do not investigate the remaining fragments because they either already point to const-qualified types or are intentionally non-const because the function modifies the pointed-to data: - dir is declared const (const lfs_mdir_t *dir) and is only read. - pcache is declared const (const lfs_cache_t *pcache) and is only read. - rcache is modified (fields and buffer contents are written), so it must be a non-const pointer. - buffer and the local pointer data are used as destinations for memcpy (written to), so they must be non-const. - other scalar parameters (hint, gmask, gtag, off, size) are non-pointer types and not relevant to Rule 8.13. - accesses like &pcache->buffer[...] and &rcache->buffer[...] are consistent with the const-qualification of pcache and the mutable rcache. Therefore they do not require further investigation under Rule 8.13."
