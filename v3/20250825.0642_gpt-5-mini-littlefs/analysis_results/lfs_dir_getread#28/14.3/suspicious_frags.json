  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions of loops. The only controlling expressions in the provided code are the two while(...) loops above; all other conditionals (if statements) are not loop controlling expressions and therefore are outside the scope of this rule. The listed loops normally modify the variables used in their controlling expressions inside their bodies (size in the first, off and/or ntag in the second), but they warrant investigation because there are code paths and computations (e.g. calculations that can yield zero, alignment/size computations, or reads that may not advance state) that could leave the controlling expression unchanged for an iteration or more, potentially creating an invariant condition and an infinite loop. No other loops are present in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
