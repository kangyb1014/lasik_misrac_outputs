  "scenario": "The assignment diff = lfs_min(diff, rcache->off-off); (inside the rcache else branch) is dead. When rcache->block == LFS_BLOCK_INLINE and off < rcache->off the code falls through to loading the cache (rcache is reinitialized and read with lfs_dir_getslice) and no use of diff occurs before the next loop iteration (where diff is re-initialized). Therefore removing this assignment would not affect program behaviour for that path, making it dead code and violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
