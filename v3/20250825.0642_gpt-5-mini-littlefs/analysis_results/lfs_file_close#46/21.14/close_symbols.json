  "explanation": "- lfs_mlist_isopen: Direct callee of lfs_file_close; its implementation must be inspected to see if it calls memcmp and whether arguments to memcmp are null-terminated strings.\\n- lfs_file_close_: Direct callee that performs the real close; its body may call memcmp (directly or via its callees) or pass string buffers to other routines.\\n- lfs_file_sync_: Callee of lfs_file_close_ (transitive); must be checked for memcmp usage or propagation of string pointers into memcmp.\\n- lfs_mlist_remove: Callee of lfs_file_close_; list removal routines often compare keys\u2014its implementation must be checked for memcmp on string keys.\\n- lfs_free: Callee of lfs_file_close_; included for completeness to inspect any wrapper behavior (unlikely to use memcmp but allows full call-chain analysis).\\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function being prohibited for null-terminated string comparisons; needed to detect direct uses.\\n- struct lfs_mlist: Type used in the lfs_mlist_isopen call and lfs_mlist_remove; its layout/fields are required to determine whether the data passed to memcmp are pointers to null-terminated strings.\\n- lfs_file_t: Type of the file parameter; its fields may contain name or buffer pointers that could be compared with memcmp\u2014needed to decide if such comparisons are of null-terminated strings.\\n- lfs_t: Filesystem context type (lfs) whose members may be passed through to callees; its definitions can show whether pointers passed down are strings.\\n\\nThese symbols (implementations and type definitions) are the minimal set required to trace the call chain from lfs_file_close and determine whether any memcmp invocation compares null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
