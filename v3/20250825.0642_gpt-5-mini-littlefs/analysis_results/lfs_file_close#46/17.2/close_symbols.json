  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_file_close violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer must inspect every function reachable from lfs_file_close to see if any path leads back to lfs_file_close. The required symbols are:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called directly by lfs_file_close; verify it does not (directly or indirectly) call lfs_file_close.\n- lfs_file_close_: called directly by lfs_file_close; inspect its body for any calls that could form a cycle back to lfs_file_close.\n- lfs_file_sync_: a callee of lfs_file_close_; must be checked because a call chain through it could return to lfs_file_close, creating indirect recursion.\n- lfs_mlist_remove: a callee of lfs_file_close_; must be checked for any calls that might lead back to lfs_file_close.\n- lfs_free: a callee of lfs_file_close_; include to ensure it (or functions it calls) do not recurse back to lfs_file_close.\n\nIf any of these functions call additional functions, those callee chains must likewise be followed until either no path to lfs_file_close is found or a cycle is detected."
