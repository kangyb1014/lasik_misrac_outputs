  "scenario": "The fragment itself only performs a cast for tracing: (void*)file. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In this function the parameter is declared as lfs_file_t *file (non-const), so the trace cast does not by itself violate 8.13. A concrete violation scenario would be: if lfs_file_close did not modify *file (i.e. file could be declared const lfs_file_t *file) but it was left as lfs_file_t *file, then the pointer parameter should be const-qualified and the trace should cast to (const void*) to avoid dropping the qualifier. Also, casting a const-qualified pointer to plain void* would violate qualifier rules (casting away const)."
