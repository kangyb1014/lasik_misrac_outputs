  "explanation": "- lfs_file_write_: Direct callee of lfs_file_write. You must inspect its body to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls lfs_file_write, which would create recursion.\n- lfs_file_flush: Called by lfs_file_write_. Inspect to see if it calls lfs_file_write (directly) or calls other functions that eventually call lfs_file_write (indirect recursion).\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Called by lfs_file_write_. Inspect it for any direct/indirect call paths back to lfs_file_write.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Direct callee of lfs_file_write. Confirm it does not call lfs_file_write (directly or via other functions).\n\nNote: If any of lfs_file_flush or lfs_file_flushedwrite (or any inspected function) call additional functions, those transitive callees must also be provided and inspected to fully determine absence of direct or indirect recursion."
