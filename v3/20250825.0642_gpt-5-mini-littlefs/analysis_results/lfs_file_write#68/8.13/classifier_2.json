  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the buffer parameter is declared as const void * and is passed unchanged to LFS_TRACE. The explicit casts to (void*) are only applied to lfs and file for printing and do not remove const from buffer. (Note: if the LFS_TRACE macro/implementation internally casts the const pointer to a non-const pointer or stores it in a non-const pointer, that internal behavior could violate Rule 8.13, but that is not visible in the provided fragment.)"
