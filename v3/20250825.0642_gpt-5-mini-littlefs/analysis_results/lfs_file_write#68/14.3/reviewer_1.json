  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct for the code as presented. With LFS_LOCK(cfg) defined as ((void)cfg,0) the assignment err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) yields a compile-time constant 0, so the controlling expression if (err) is invariant (always false). None of the listed exceptions to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 apply (it is not an intentionally infinite loop nor a do-while constant-false integer constant expression). Therefore, in this configuration the code violates Rule 14.3. (Note: if the macro LFS_LOCK is redefined in other build configurations to perform real locking and return a non-constant result, the violation would not hold in those configurations; MISRA conformance must be judged per relevant configuration.)"
