  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_write (or anything it calls) uses the standard memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer needs the bodies/declarations of the following symbols:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly by lfs_file_write via LFS_ASSERT. We must inspect this function to ensure it does not call memcmp (or otherwise compare strings with memcmp).\n\n- lfs_file_write_: lfs_file_write delegates the real work to this function. Any use of memcmp that violates the MISRA rule could occur here, so its implementation must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite: These are the direct callees of lfs_file_write_ (per the call graph). memcmp usage in either of these deeper callees would still be relevant to lfs_file_write and must be checked.\n\n- memcmp: The actual standard library symbol must be identified so every occurrence/call site can be checked to see whether its arguments are null-terminated strings (the specific MISRA violation).\n\nNote: If any of the above functions call additional helpers (not listed in the provided static graph), those helpers should also be included if they contain memcmp calls or produce buffers/strings passed to memcmp. The listed symbols are the minimal set directly necessary to decide whether a memcmp-based null-terminated string comparison could originate from lfs_file_write."
