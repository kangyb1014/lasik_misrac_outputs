Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "You must inspect the bodies and definitions of the following symbols because the MISRA requirement about well-formed for-loops applies not only to for-statements textually present in lfs_fs_grow_ but also to the behaviour of any functions called by the for statement or contained functions. For each symbol below: why it is needed for the MISRA for-loop analysis\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: callee of lfs_fs_grow_. Inspect for-loops inside it (and whether it or its callees modify loop counters or non-local objects used as loop control).\n- lfs_dir_fetchmatch: direct callee of lfs_dir_fetch; may contain loops or modify objects seen by callers.\n- lfs_dir_get: callee used inside lfs_fs_grow_. Must be checked for any for-loops and side effects (functions called inside it count as part of the loop body behavior).\n- lfs_dir_getslice: callee of lfs_dir_get; may implement iteration/loops affecting analysis.\n- lfs_tag_size: callee of lfs_dir_get; could contain loops or side-effecting behaviour relevant to loop-counter rules.\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32: called to convert superblock; inspect for-loops inside conversion routine that could violate loop-counter rules.\n- lfs_fromle32: helper called by superblock_fromle32; may contain loops or counter modifications.\n- lfs_superblock_tole32: inverse conversion called before commit; inspect its body for loops/side effects.\n- lfs_tole32: helper called by superblock_tole32; may contain loops or modifications relevant to rule.\n- lfs_dir_commit: called to commit changes; likely to iterate directory entries \u2014 must inspect any for-loops for proper loop-counter usage and whether functions it calls are invoked from loop headers/bodies.\n- lfs_dir_orphaningcommit: callee of lfs_dir_commit; may contain iterations or modify objects that could be used as loop counters elsewhere.\n- lfs_fs_deorphan: callee of lfs_dir_commit; inspect for loops and side effects.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: conditional callee (under LFS_SHRINKNONRELOCATING) invoked by lfs_fs_grow_. It traverses filesystem structures and is very likely to contain loops; its behaviour counts as part of the body of any loop that calls it.\n- lfs_shrink_checkblock: callback passed into lfs_fs_traverse_. The callback's body (possibly called repeatedly inside loops) must be inspected for modifications of loop counters or other side effects that influence loop control.\n- lfs_t (type and its member block_count): the lfs_t structure and in particular block_count are read and written in lfs_fs_grow_. Inspect whether any called function's loops modify lfs->block_count (which would violate clause 2/3 if used as loop control) or if block_count is used as a loop counter elsewhere.\n- lfs_size_t: typedef of block_count parameter; needed to determine whether types used as loop counters are scalar/integer and to reason about modification semantics.\n- lfs_mdir_t: directory metadata structure fetched/committed; fields may be read/modified by callees that contain loops \u2014 need its definition to understand which objects might be loop counters or be modified in loop bodies.\n- lfs_superblock_t: structure updated here; inspect its fields to see whether they are used as loop control in callees or modified inside loops.\n- lfs_stag_t: return/tag type from lfs_dir_get; its semantics/values may affect conditional expressions used as loop controls in caller/callees.\n- LFS_MKTAG: macro used to build tag expressions passed into lfs_dir_get; macros can expand to expressions that include side effects or loop-influencing constructs \u2014 inspect expansion if relevant.\n- LFS_TYPE_INLINESTRUCT: macro/constant used in the tag; needed to understand the call to lfs_dir_get and any control expressions derived from it.\n- LFS_MKATTRS: macro used when calling lfs_dir_commit; may expand to initializer/expression that could contain side effects or objects used in loops.\n- LFS_ASSERT: macro used in this function under config; may expand to expressions with side effects or conditional compile behavior affecting presence of code.\n- LFS_SHRINKNONRELOCATING: configuration macro that changes which code-paths exist (presence or absence of the lfs_fs_traverse_ call). Its definition controls whether additional functions (traverse + callback) must be analyzed.\n\nIn short: to verify MISRA's for-loop clauses you must examine any for-loops in lfs_fs_grow_'s callees (and their callees), determine the loop counters and loop-control flags, and confirm those counters are only initialized/modified in the allowed clauses and not modified by called functions. The list above contains the direct callees and the immediate transitive callees, plus the relevant types and macros needed to reason about loop counters, flags, and conditional compilation that affects whether those functions are invoked."
