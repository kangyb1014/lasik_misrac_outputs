  "explanation": "I found no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in this function body. The listed fragments are calls that pass pointers (or pointer-sized objects) to other functions or helpers which may internally perform memory operations (e.g. copying/serializing structs, reading/writing directory entries). These should be investigated because those callee implementations could use string.h functions and must ensure they do not access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. Other fragments were not included because they do not pass object pointers to functions that could perform buffer/byte operations or otherwise interact with <string.h> routines: simple scalar comparisons and assignments (e.g. if (block_count == lfs->block_count), lfs->block_count = block_count), the LFS_ASSERT macro usage (no pointer buffer operation here), the LFS_MKTAG constant constructions (they don't pass pointers to memory-manipulating functions), the tag < 0 check and early returns, and the function return statements. These remaining lines do not, by themselves, present a plausible risk under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
