  "explanation": "I did not find any constructs that are clearly compiler-specific language extensions as documented by mainstream compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC, IAR, Keil, etc.). The items that might look non\u2011standard at first glance are actually standard C features (C99 and later), not compiler extensions:\n\n- The LFS_MKATTRS macro uses a compound literal ((struct lfs_mattr[]){ ... }) and a variadic macro (__VA_ARGS__). Both compound literals and variadic macros are part of the C99 standard, not compiler extensions.\n- The use of // single-line comments and the bool type (_Bool/bool from <stdbool.h>) are C99 features as well.\n- Bitwise shifts, casts, and the macro LFS_MKTAG are standard C operations, not extensions.\n- Conditional compilation (#ifdef / #ifndef) and assert usage via LFS_ASSERT are standard preprocessor and library facilities.\n\nI also noted what appears to be a typo in the provided macro definition text: \"structlfs_mattr[]\" (missing space) \u2014 this looks like a transcription/formatting issue rather than a language extension. If that token really appears in the source it would be a syntax error, not an extension.\n\nIf your target toolchain explicitly documents any of the above C99 features as \"extensions\" (for example, if the project mandates strict C89-only compilers or a particular compiler marks some C99 features as extensions), then those features should be re-evaluated against that compiler's documentation. Based on the code shown and typical compiler documentation, there are no explicit compiler language extensions present to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
