  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-branch is reachable at runtime whenever lfs->cfg->lookahead_buffer == NULL (i.e. when the configuration did not supply a lookahead buffer). There is no prior unconditional return or other control flow that makes this code impossible to execute. (Only if there is an external invariant that guarantees cfg->lookahead_buffer is always non-NULL would this branch be provably unreachable, but no such invariant is shown.)"
