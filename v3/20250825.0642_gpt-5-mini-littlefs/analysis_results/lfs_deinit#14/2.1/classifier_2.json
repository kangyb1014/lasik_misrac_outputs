  "scenario": "No violation. The condition if (!lfs->cfg->read_buffer) depends on a run-time value (lfs->cfg->read_buffer). The lfs_free call is reachable whenever read_buffer is NULL at run time. This fragment does not contain unreachable code. (It would only be unreachable if read_buffer were a compile-time constant that made the condition always false/true, which is not shown.)"
