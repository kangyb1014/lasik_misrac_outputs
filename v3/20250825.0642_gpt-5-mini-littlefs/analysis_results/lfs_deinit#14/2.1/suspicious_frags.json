  "explanation": "I selected the entire function declaration (static linkage may make the function unused/unreferenced in the translation unit) and each conditional block that performs lfs_free() because these are the points most likely to be unreachable (either the static function is never called, or particular branches may never be taken due to configuration invariants). Other fragments in the snippet do not require investigation for unreachable-code under MISRA Rule 2.1: the comment line is non-executable, the surrounding braces and whitespace are syntactic only, and the conditional tests themselves are not constant expressions in this snippet (so cannot be determined unreachable from this code alone). The final return statement is reachable whenever the function executes, so it is not flagged separately."
