  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol (what to look for and why):\n\n- lfs_t\n  - You must see the full definition of lfs_t to know the exact types of its members (cfg, rcache, pcache, lookahead). The const-qualification question applies to the declared pointer types in these members.\n\n- lfs_config (the type of lfs->cfg)\n  - The code tests cfg->read_buffer, cfg->prog_buffer, cfg->lookahead_buffer. You need the declarations of these members (their pointer types and const qualifiers) to determine whether they should or are declared const.\n\n- declaration/type of lfs->rcache (the struct/type that has .buffer)\n  - lfs_deinit calls lfs_free(lfs->rcache.buffer). To judge whether the buffer pointer should be const-qualified you must know the declared type of rcache.buffer (pointer target type and qualifiers) and whether other code writes through it.\n\n- declaration/type of lfs->pcache (the struct/type that has .buffer)\n  - Same reason as rcache: lfs_deinit frees pcache.buffer; you need its declared pointer type/qualifiers to check for missing const.\n\n- declaration/type of lfs->lookahead (the struct/type that has .buffer)\n  - Same reason: lfs_deinit frees lookahead.buffer; you must know its declared type and qualifiers.\n\n- lfs_free (prototype)\n  - The function signature (parameter type) determines whether freeing is performed on void * or const void *. If lfs_free takes a non-const pointer, it may indicate the library expects modifiable buffers; if it takes const void *, that affects the const-correctness analysis.\n\n- lfs_cache_zero\n  - This function is known (from the call graph) to touch cache buffers. You need its declaration/definition to see whether it writes into the cache buffer(s). If it writes, the buffer cannot be const; if it only reads, const qualification might be possible.\n\n- all functions that read from or write to the .buffer members (any function that accesses lfs->rcache.buffer, lfs->pcache.buffer, or lfs->lookahead.buffer)\n  - To decide whether a pointer can be const-qualified you must know whether those buffers are ever modified. Therefore include the declarations/definitions of every function that accesses these .buffer members (read, write, memcpy into/out of them, pass them to functions that mutate them). The set should include any block-device or I/O helpers and cache/prog/read routines that take the buffers as destination/source parameters.\n\nCollecting the above symbols lets the next analyst determine (a) the exact pointer types and const qualifiers as declared, (b) whether those buffers are modified anywhere (which would prohibit const), and (c) whether the library API (lfs_free) expects non-const pointers \u2014 all necessary facts to assess compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer targets."
