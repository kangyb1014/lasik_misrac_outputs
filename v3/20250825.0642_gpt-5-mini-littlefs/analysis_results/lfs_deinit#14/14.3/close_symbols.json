  "explanation": "- lfs_t (definition): needed to know the exact types and qualifiers of the members accessed in the controlling expressions (cfg, rcache, pcache, lookahead). Qualifiers (const/volatile) or typedefs can make a controlling expression effectively invariant.\n- lfs->cfg type and its field declarations (read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer): the if conditions test these fields. You must know their types and qualifiers (pointer vs integer, const, static, or macro-defined) to determine whether the expressions (!lfs->cfg->read_buffer etc.) can vary at runtime or are compile-time/invariant.\n- Types/definitions of lfs->rcache, lfs->pcache and lfs->lookahead and their .buffer declarations: to confirm what is being freed (pointer type, ownership) and whether those buffer fields can change independently of cfg fields; this affects whether the controlling tests are meaningful at runtime.\n- lfs_free (declaration or macro): to verify whether lfs_free is a plain function or a macro with side-effects or compile-time behaviour that could influence whether the conditional is effectively invariant.\n- lfs_init (and any functions that initialise lfs->cfg and the internal buffers): to see where/read how cfg->read_buffer/prog_buffer/lookahead_buffer and the internal .buffer fields are assigned. If those assignments are fixed at initialization and never change, the controlling expressions in lfs_deinit may be invariant; if they may change at runtime, the expressions are not invariant.\n- Compile-time configuration macros/constants that affect buffer presence or defaults (e.g. buffer-size or feature macros): if the existence/value of the cfg fields is governed by compile-time macros, the conditions can be invariants at compile time. Identifying these macros is necessary to decide whether the controlling expressions violate the MISRA rule."
