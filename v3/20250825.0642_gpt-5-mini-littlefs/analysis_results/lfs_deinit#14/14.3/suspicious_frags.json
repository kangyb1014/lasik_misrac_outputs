  "explanation": "Only the three if-statements are controlling constructs in this function and therefore are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other conditional constructs (e.g., do-while) in this function to consider. Other lines (function signature, lfs_free calls, return statement) are not controlling expressions and thus do not fall under Rule 14.3; they do not need investigation for this specific rule."
