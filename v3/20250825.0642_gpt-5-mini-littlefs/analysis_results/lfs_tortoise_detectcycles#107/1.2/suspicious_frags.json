  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions were found in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C (as of C99 and later):\n- // single-line comments (standard in C99+),\n- static inline function (inline is standard from C99),\n- array function parameters (e.g. paira[2]),\n- variadic macros using __VA_ARGS__ (standard in C99),\n- ordinary expressions, operators, and array indexing.\n\nNo compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, pragma extensions, GCC builtins, or other vendor-specific keywords were present. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions not used). If the project targets a pre-C99 compiler that documents any of the above as extensions, re-evaluate accordingly, but based on the code and common compiler documentation there are no explicit extensions to report."
