  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: data is used as a writable byte pointer to the caller-supplied buffer (the function reads file data into buffer via lfs_dir_getread/lfs_bd_read), so the pointee must be modifiable and cannot reasonably be const-qualified. A violation would occur if the code only read from the buffer (treated it as an input/source) but declared a non-const pointer; that is not the case here."
