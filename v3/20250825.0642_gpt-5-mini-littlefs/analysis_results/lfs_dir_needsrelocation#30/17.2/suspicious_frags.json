  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function should be investigated for Rule 17.2 because the function body contains no function-call expressions (direct or indirect). The return expression only performs structure member accesses (lfs->cfg->block_cycles and dir->rev), arithmetic (+, %), a bitwise OR (|), a comparison (==), and a logical conjunction (&&). None of these operations invoke functions or function-like macros in the given code fragment. The function is declared static (internal linkage) but that does not introduce recursion. If there were concerns about hidden calls via macros or function-like side effects, they would need to appear in the snippet (e.g., a macro expansion or a function call); since none are present, no recursive call sources are present in this code fragment."
