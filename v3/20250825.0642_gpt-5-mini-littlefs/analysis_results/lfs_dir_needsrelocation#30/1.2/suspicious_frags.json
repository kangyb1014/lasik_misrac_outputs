  "explanation": "I examined the function lfs_dir_needsrelocation and the related type definitions provided. No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the supplied code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang keywords or built-ins such as __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, or __label__/labels-as-values.\n- There are no statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nor nested functions (a GCC extension).\n- There is no use of inline assembly, platform-specific pragmas, or vendor-specific storage-class specifiers.\n- All constructs are standard C: static function, bool (C99 stdbool), struct/typedef, integer arithmetic, bitwise and modulo operators, pointer dereferencing, conditional logic, and preprocessor conditional (#ifdef) usage.\n\nIf there are other files or macros (e.g. definitions of lfs_block_t, lfs_size_t, or config macros) that use compiler-specific extensions, they were not included here and could require review. Based only on the provided code fragments, there are no MISRA Rule 1.2 violations to flag."
