  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe function lfs_dir_needsrelocation takes parameters lfs_t *lfs and lfs_mdir_t *dir but only reads from them (uses lfs->cfg->block_cycles and dir->rev). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 these pointers should be to const-qualified types when possible (e.g., const lfs_t *lfs, const lfs_mdir_t *dir, and any intermediate cfg pointer to const). Because the parameters are not const-qualified even though they could be, the rule is violated.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_dir_needsrelocation code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/303.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_dir_needsrelocation as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_needsrelocation:\n```c\nstatic bool lfs_dir_needsrelocation(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_mdir_t *dir) {\n    // If our revision count == n * block_cycles, we should force a relocation,\n    // this is how littlefs wear-levels at the metadata-pair level. Note that we\n    // actually use (block_cycles+1)|1, this is to avoid two corner cases:\n    // 1. block_cycles = 1, which would prevent relocations from terminating\n    // 2. block_cycles = 2n, which, due to aliasing, would only ever relocate\n    //    one metadata block in the pair, effectively making this useless\n    return (lfs->cfg->block_cycles > 0\n            && ((dir->rev + 1) % ((lfs->cfg->block_cycles+1)|1) == 0));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_dir_needsrelocation code.\n",
