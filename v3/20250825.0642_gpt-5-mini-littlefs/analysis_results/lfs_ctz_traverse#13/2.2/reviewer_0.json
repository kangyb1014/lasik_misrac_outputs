  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The two lfs_fromle32 assignments are used on the normal (err == 0) path: the converted values are later consumed (heads[0] always, and heads[1] when count == 2). Removing those conversions entirely would change behaviour for the success case, so they are not dead. Likewise, the write to heads[1] that is redundant when count == 1 is not globally dead code \u2014 it is required in other iterations when count == 2. It is only unnecessary in certain runtime branches, which is not the same as being dead code under MISRA 2.2. (If desired for clarity or performance, the code can be refactored to check err before doing conversions and only convert the elements that will be used, but that is a style/efficiency change, not a MISRA 2.2 violation.)"
