  "explanation": "The compile error was due to redeclaring the variable 'err' twice in the same scope. I fixed this by using a single 'int err;' and assigning to it for both the callback and the lfs_bd_read call (removed the second 'int' declaration). Also changed 'while (true)' to 'while (1)' to avoid depending on <stdbool.h>. No other logic was changed; behavior and logging remain as in the original code."
