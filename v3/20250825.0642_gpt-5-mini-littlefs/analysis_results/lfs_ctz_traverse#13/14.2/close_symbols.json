  "explanation": "To decide whether the for-loop \"for (int i = 0; i < count-1; i++) ...\" is MISRA well-formed we must prove that: (a) there is a single loop counter only (i) and it is not modified in the loop body (including via called functions), and (b) the second and third clauses use only permitted objects and those objects are not modified by the loop body or any functions it calls. The listed symbols are required for that proof:\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: This is the direct caller of lfs_ctz_traverse (per the call graph). We must inspect this caller to see exactly which callback and data it passes into lfs_ctz_traverse. That determines the concrete cb/data used at runtime and whether they can affect the loop counter or the objects used in the for-condition (count).\n\n- the concrete callback function(s) passed as the cb argument to lfs_ctz_traverse (their full definitions/prototypes): The body of the for-loop invokes cb(data, heads[i]). MISRA treats effects of called functions as part of the loop body. We need the callback implementation(s) and prototypes to determine whether they (or any functions they call) modify the loop counter i, the local variable count, or any other object used in the for clauses (or have persistent side-effects that would violate clause 2). Without the actual callback code we cannot rule out side-effects on the loop control variables.\n\n- the concrete data object(s) passed as the data argument to lfs_ctz_traverse (definitions/initialization): The callback receives the void* data parameter. If data points (directly or indirectly) to the loop counter or to objects used in the for clauses (e.g. if the caller mistakenly passes &count or an overlapping object), the callback could modify them. Inspecting the actual data object(s) passed by lfs_fs_traverse_ removes this ambiguity.\n\n- any functions called by the callback(s) (their full definitions/prototypes): Because the behaviour of called functions is part of the loop body, any transitive callees of the callback must be inspected for modifications of i, count, or other objects used in the for clauses.\n\nNotes: other functions called earlier in lfs_ctz_traverse (lfs_ctz_index, lfs_bd_read, lfs_fromle32) are already in the static call graph and the target function source; they do not appear inside the for-loop body (except cb), so the only additional code required to assess MISRA compliance for this for-loop is the caller (to discover what cb/data are passed) and the concrete callback(s) plus their callees/data definitions to rule out prohibited side-effects."
