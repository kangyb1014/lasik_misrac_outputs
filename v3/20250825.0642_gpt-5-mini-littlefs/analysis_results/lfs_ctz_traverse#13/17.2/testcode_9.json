  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 is: Functions shall not call themselves, either directly or indirectly.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 17.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call cb(data, heads[i]) can invoke a callback that in turn calls lfs_ctz_traverse, producing indirect recursion. For example:\n\nint mycb(void *data, lfs_block_t b) {\n    lfs_t *lfs = (lfs_t*)data;\n    return lfs_ctz_traverse(lfs, NULL, &lfs->rcache, b, some_size, mycb, data);\n}\n\nIf mycb is passed as cb, lfs_ctz_traverse -> mycb -> lfs_ctz_traverse is an indirect recursive call chain, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_ctz_traverse code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/136.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_ctz_traverse as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_ctz_traverse:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_ctz_traverse(lfs_t *lfs,\n        const lfs_cache_t *pcache, lfs_cache_t *rcache,\n        lfs_block_t head, lfs_size_t size,\n        int (*cb)(void*, lfs_block_t), void *data) {\n    if (size == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    lfs_off_t index = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){size-1});\n\n    while (true) {\n        int err = cb(data, head);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        if (index == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        lfs_block_t heads[2];\n        int count = 2 - (index & 1);\n        err = lfs_bd_read(lfs,\n                pcache, rcache, count*sizeof(head),\n                head, 0, &heads, count*sizeof(head));\n        heads[0] = lfs_fromle32(heads[0]);\n        heads[1] = lfs_fromle32(heads[1]);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < count-1; i++) {\n            err = cb(data, heads[i]);\n            if (err) {\n                return err;\n            }\n        }\n\n        head = heads[count-1];\n        index -= count;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_ctz_traverse code.\n",
