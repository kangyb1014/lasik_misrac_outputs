  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the single call. The fragment itself (err = lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(lfs);) does not violate Rule 8.13 because whether the pointer should be const depends on the callee prototype and whether the pointed-to object is modified. Specific violation scenario: if neither this wrapper nor lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ modify the object pointed to by lfs, but the parameter is declared as lfs_t * (non-const) instead of const lfs_t *, then Rule 8.13 would be violated \u2014 the pointer target should be const-qualified (e.g. const lfs_t *) and const should be propagated through the API."
