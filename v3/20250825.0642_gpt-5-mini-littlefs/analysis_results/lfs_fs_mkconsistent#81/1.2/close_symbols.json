  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK (macro definition): The target function calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). Many projects implement LOCK macros using compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, or other non\u2011standard builtins). To determine if the call site uses a language extension you must inspect the macro expansion/definition.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro definition): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK: the unlock macro may expand to non\u2011standard constructs or use compiler attributes/builtins. The macro definition is required to decide MISRA conformance.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro definition): Tracing/logging macros commonly use variadic macros, format wrappers, or compiler extensions (e.g., __VA_ARGS__ is C99 but some projects use GNU extensions, or they may use __FUNCTION__/__PRETTY_FUNCTION__, statement-expressions, attributes). Inspecting the macro (and any helpers it expands to) is necessary to see if language extensions are used.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition, including the type of lfs->cfg): The code dereferences lfs->cfg and passes it to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK. The struct/type definition may include anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields, or other compiler extensions that affect whether the target function (via member access or casts) uses language extensions. Also the cfg type could be a macro alias that expands to an extension.\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (declaration/definition): The target function calls this function; its prototype or definition may use attributes (e.g., __attribute__((...))), inline/extern qualifiers, or other extensions that could make the call in the target function rely on language extensions. Inspecting the declaration/definition is required.\n\n- Any helper symbols expanded/used by the above macros (underlying lock/unlock functions, trace/printf wrapper macros/functions): Macros often expand into other helper macros/functions. Those helper symbols (their definitions) must be checked because they may be the actual carriers of compiler-specific extensions (builtins, asm, attributes)."
