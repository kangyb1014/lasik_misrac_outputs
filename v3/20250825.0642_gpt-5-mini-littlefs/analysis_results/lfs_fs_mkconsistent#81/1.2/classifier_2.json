  "scenario": "The fragment 'int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);' by itself does not use any documented compiler language extensions. It is a normal variable definition initialized with the result of a macro invocation. No violation is detected unless the macro LFS_LOCK is implemented using a compiler extension (for example a GCC statement-expression ({ ... }), typeof, or other non\u2011standard construct). If LFS_LOCK expands to such an extension, that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
