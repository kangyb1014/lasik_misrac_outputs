  "explanation": "To determine whether the parameter 'lfs' (a pointer parameter) is modified (directly reassigned) in lfs_fs_mkconsistent, you must inspect: 1) lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (the direct callee) because the parameter could be reassigned there or its address passed onward; 2) all of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_'s callees (lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit) because a nested call might reassign the original parameter (for example if a function takes a pointer-to-pointer or is passed &lfs from an intermediate); 3) the macro definitions LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, and LFS_TRACE because macros may expand into code that has side effects (including assignments) that could modify the parameter variable; and 4) the lfs_t type definition to confirm that the parameter is a pointer (and not some unusual typedef/array) and to understand members used (e.g., lfs->cfg) when reasoning about macro expansions. Inspecting these symbols lets you find any direct assignment to the local parameter variable 'lfs' or any code path that could cause it to be modified, which is required to check the MISRA rule."
