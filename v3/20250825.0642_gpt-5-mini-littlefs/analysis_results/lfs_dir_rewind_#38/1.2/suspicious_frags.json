  "explanation": "I reviewed each token and construct in the function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function, standard integer type int, pointer parameters, a function call, assignment, single-line comments (//) which are part of standard C since C99, and return statements. There are no compiler-specific or vendor-specific extensions present \u2014 no __attribute__ or __inline__-style keywords, no asm/inline assembly, no typeof, no statement expressions, no platform-specific pragmas, no identifiers prefixed with reserved implementation names (e.g. starting with __), and no other documented compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
