  "explanation": "No fragments modify the function parameters themselves. The code does not assign to the pointer parameters lfs or dir (no statements like lfs = ... or dir = ...). The writes dir->id = 0 and dir->pos = 0 modify the object pointed to by dir, which is permitted by the rule. The call lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &dir->m, dir->head) passes pointers to members but does not alter the parameter variables within this function. The local variable err is local and its use/assignment does not affect the function parameters. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in this function."
