  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_commitprog:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_dir_commitprog(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_commit *commit,\n        const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = lfs_bd_prog(lfs,\n            &lfs->pcache, &lfs->rcache, false,\n            commit->block, commit->off ,\n            (const uint8_t*)buffer, size);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    commit->crc = lfs_crc(commit->crc, buffer, size);\n    commit->off += size;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncommit->crc = lfs_crc(commit->crc, buffer, size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment updates the running CRC of the commit (commit->crc = lfs_crc(commit->crc, buffer, size)); this value is used later to verify or write the commit\u2019s integrity. Removing this update would change subsequent behavior (invalid or stale CRC), so the operation is not dead code."
