  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer-to-object declarations/parameters that could reasonably be const-qualified, or they clearly require non-const pointers:\n\n- The early-return branch that assigns *block = LFS_BLOCK_NULL; and *off = 0; uses output parameters that must be non-const so they are intentionally non-const.\n- Local scalar variables (size, pos, head, current, target, skip) and arithmetic operations (lfs_min, lfs_npw2, lfs_ctz, current -= 1 << skip) do not introduce pointer parameters that could be const-qualified.\n- The call sites and uses of pcache are already const-qualified in the function signature (const lfs_cache_t *pcache), so no further investigation is needed for those uses.\n- The write/read buffer passed as &head to lfs_bd_read is included in the suspicious list for review; other buffer/parameter uses that are obviously outputs or intentionally mutable were excluded.\n\nThe reported fragments are those where pointer parameters or pointer arguments appear to be non-const but may be eligible to be const-qualified (or where temporaries/addresses are passed), and thus warrant investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
