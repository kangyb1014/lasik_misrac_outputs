  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify function parameters (the pointer variables themselves) in the provided code. Specific points: \n\n- lfs_file_read: no assignments to any parameters (lfs, file, buffer, size). Macros used (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_ASSERT) do not assign to these parameters; LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK expand to expressions that only reference cfg but do not modify the passed pointer.\n\n- lfs_file_read_: no assignments to its parameters (lfs, file, buffer, size). It reads file->flags and calls other functions; modifying the object pointed to (e.g. file->flags) is allowed by the rule, and no code assigns to the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: although it takes the address of the parameter head (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head), it never modifies the parameter variable head itself; p is advanced to point into the list nodes, but there is no write to head. The function only reads the list through pointers, which is permitted (the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified; here it is only read).\n\n- Calls to other functions (lfs_file_read_ and potential lfs_file_flush / lfs_file_flushedread) pass the parameters without assignment. Any modifications to objects pointed to are allowed; none of the shown code reassigns parameter variables.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
