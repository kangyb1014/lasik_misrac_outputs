  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer parameter/argument in lfs_file_read should be const-qualified you must see how those pointers are used and what the called routines expect. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_file_read_: need its prototype/definition to see the exact parameter types and whether it modifies lfs, file, or buffer (determines if they can be const).\n- lfs_file_flushedread: lfs_file_read_ calls this; its prototype/definition shows whether the buffer argument is written to (so buffer must be non-const) or only read from (could be const).\n- lfs_file_flush: called by lfs_file_read_; its prototype/definition may require non-const file or lfs pointers, preventing const qualification of those parameters upstream.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: target calls this with (struct lfs_mlist*)file and lfs->mlist; need its prototype to know whether it accepts const pointers (and whether the cast hides a const-qualifier violation).\n- lfs_t (type definition): contains cfg and mlist fields; need to know their types (and whether fields are mutable) to judge if lfs parameter could be const.\n- lfs_file_t (type definition): to determine whether the file object is modified by this function or any callee (affects whether file* could be const).\n- struct lfs_mlist (type definition): to understand the relationship between lfs_file_t and mlist and whether const correctness is broken by casting.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function): its definition shows whether it mutates lfs->cfg (thus forbids making lfs or cfg pointer const) and whether it expects a const-qualified argument.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function): same reason as LFS_LOCK; its usage can require non-const cfg/lfs.\n- LFS_ASSERT (macro): the macro may wrap lfs_mlist_isopen or otherwise evaluate arguments in a way that affects const-correctness or hides casts; its definition is needed to see if it forces non-const usage.\n\nProviding these symbols (prototypes/definitions) lets an analyst trace whether any pointer passed into or through lfs_file_read is actually modified or required non-const by callees (so must remain non-const) or is only read (so should be const per MISRA)."
