  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_read() (directly or indirectly) uses the C library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the implementations of all functions it calls must be inspected for memcmp usage and the context of any comparisons:\n\n- lfs_file_read_: This is the primary callee of lfs_file_read. Any memcmp use in lfs_file_read_ (or its callers) would make lfs_file_read effectively violate the rule. You must inspect lfs_file_read_ to see if it calls memcmp and whether the compared data are null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: lfs_file_read_ calls lfs_file_flush. If lfs_file_flush uses memcmp (or produces/returns data that get compared as strings), that must be checked.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: Also called by lfs_file_read_. It must be checked for direct memcmp usage or string comparison semantics of its buffers/lengths.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called from lfs_file_read via LFS_ASSERT. Although it does not appear on the execution path for data reads, it may contain memcmp usage (for example, comparing file name strings) and thus must be inspected to ensure no memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nInspecting these symbols allows the next analyst to locate any memcmp calls reachable from lfs_file_read and to determine whether those memcmp calls compare null\u2011terminated strings (MISRA violation) or compare binary buffers/lengths (allowed)."
