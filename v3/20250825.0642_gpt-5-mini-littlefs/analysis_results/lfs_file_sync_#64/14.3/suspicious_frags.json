  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (constant) at compile time and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The control statements in the function and why they need not be investigated are:\n\n- if (file->flags & LFS_F_ERRED)\n  - Depends on the runtime value of file->flags; not a compile-time constant.\n\n- if (err)\n  - Depends on err returned by lfs_file_flush and later by other calls; not constant.\n\n- if ((file->flags & LFS_F_DIRTY) && !lfs_pair_isnull(file->m.pair))\n  - Both subexpressions depend on runtime state (file->flags and file->m.pair). lfs_pair_isnull is a runtime check/macro and its result is not a compile-time constant.\n\n- if (!(file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE))\n  - Depends on file->flags at runtime.\n\n- if (file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE)\n  - Depends on file->flags at runtime.\n\n- if (err) (after lfs_dir_commit)\n  - Depends on err returned by lfs_dir_commit; not constant.\n\nNo do-while loops or other constructs with potentially allowed invariant controlling expressions are present. All conditions depend on function parameters, fields that can change, or return values from function calls, so none are invariant and none need further investigation for this MISRA rule."
