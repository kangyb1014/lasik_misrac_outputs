  "explanation": "No pointer parameters are reassigned or otherwise modified in this function. The code updates members of the objects pointed to (e.g. file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED, file->flags &= ~LFS_F_DIRTY, ctz = file->ctz), which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). There are no statements that change the pointer parameters themselves (no assignments like file = ..., lfs = ..., nor pointer arithmetic on them). Passing addresses of members (e.g. &file->m, &lfs->pcache) or passing the parameters to other functions does not constitute modifying the pointer parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under Rule 17.8."
