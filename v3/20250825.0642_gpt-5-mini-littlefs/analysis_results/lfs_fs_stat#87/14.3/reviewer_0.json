The controlling expression if (err) is therefore invariant (always false).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The macro LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) expands to ((void)cfg,0), so err is initialized to the constant 0. The controlling expression if (err) therefore always evaluates to false at that point \u2014 it is invariant. This is not one of the permitted exceptions to Rule 14.3 (not an infinite loop nor the allowed do-while constant-false case), so the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Note that the subsequent assignment to err does not affect the fact that the controlling expression was invariant when evaluated, so the reported violation is valid."
