  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specific checks and reasons:\n\n- LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) -> expands to ((void)cfg,0): uses the comma operator and a void cast; both are standard C, not compiler extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) -> expands to ((void)cfg): uses a void cast and a parenthesized expression; standard C.\n- LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) -> defined as an empty variadic macro: variadic macros are standard since C99; an empty replacement list is a valid preprocessor construct and not a compiler extension.\n- Casts like (void*)lfs and (void*)fsinfo and format specifier %p are standard C usage for pointer printing.\n- No occurrences of known compiler extensions are present (no __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, inline asm, labels as values, or other vendor-specific tokens).\n\nBecause none of the code fragments use language extensions explicitly documented as compiler extensions, there are no fragments to flag for investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
