  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_stat_: The target delegates work to this function. Any use of memcmp (and whether it is used to compare null-terminated strings) may occur here, so its body must be inspected.  \n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock: Called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_fs_stat_. It may contain memcmp uses or string comparisons; include it to find memcmp usages and the nature of the compared buffers.  \n- lfs_fs_disk_version: Callee of lfs_fs_stat_. It may perform version/string comparisons (where memcmp could be misused). Inspect its implementation for memcmp on null-terminated strings.  \n- lfs_dir_fetch: Callee that likely manipulates directory entries/filenames. If it uses memcmp to compare names, those names may be null-terminated strings \u2014 must inspect.  \n- lfs_dir_get: Callee that returns/handles directory entries or names. Include to check for memcmp usage on string fields.  \n- lfs_superblock_fromle32: Callee that converts/compares superblock fields; might use memcmp on fields that could be null-terminated character arrays.  \n- memcmp: The standard library function named in the MISRA rule. You must inspect every occurrence of this symbol in the above functions to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation).  \n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type used by the target. Field layouts may show whether buffers passed into callees are strings (null-terminated) or binary buffers; needed to determine if memcmp operands are NUL-terminated strings.  \n- struct lfs_fsinfo: The output structure filled/used by lfs_fs_stat_/callees. Its member types (e.g., character arrays) must be known to decide if memcmp is comparing null-terminated strings.  \n- lfs_superblock: Structure type referenced by superblock-related callees; its member types (character arrays vs binary data) are needed to decide whether any memcmp on superblock fields involves null-terminated strings."
