  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro (or function-like macro) used at the start of lfs_fs_stat. A macro expansion could contain an assignment to the parameter variable (for example an expression that rebinds `lfs`), so you must inspect its definition to prove the pointer parameters themselves are not modified by the macro expansion.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it is invoked using lfs->cfg and could be a macro that expands to code that modifies a parameter; verify it does not reassign the pointer parameters.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros sometimes expand to multi-statement constructs that could (mis)use parameters. Include its definition to confirm it does not modify the pointer parameters.\n- lfs_fs_stat_: The called function is the only non-macro call in lfs_fs_stat. Even though a callee cannot directly reassign the caller's local parameter variable, you must inspect its prototype/definition to ensure there is no unusual macro indirection or inline expansion that could alter the behaviour inside lfs_fs_stat (for example, if lfs_fs_stat_ is actually a macro or inline that contains code operating on the caller's parameter variable). Also check it does not rely on side-effecting macros that might have modified parameters in the caller.\n- lfs_t: The definition of the lfs_t type (especially the cfg member) is required so you can inspect uses like lfs->cfg in macros and be sure no parameter reassignment occurs via member access.\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: Include the declaration/definition so you can confirm whether fsinfo is actually a pointer type alias or subject to any unusual macro/type tricks that could lead to modification of the parameter variable itself.\n\nIn short: inspect all macro definitions used in this function and the types/signature of the callee to prove that neither pointer parameter identifier (lfs, fsinfo) is reassigned inside lfs_fs_stat (the MISRA rule subject)."
