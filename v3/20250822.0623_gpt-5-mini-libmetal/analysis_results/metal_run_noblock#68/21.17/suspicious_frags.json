  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the string-handling functions from <string.h>. In this translation unit the only use of a <string.h> function is strerror(...), so the call to strerror and the expression that computes the value passed to it should be investigated. Other lines (the tids NULL check, the cast to (pthread_t *) and indexing tid_p[i], the pthread_create invocation except for its return value used above, the assignment *threads_out = i, and the metal_log call format usage) do not invoke functions from <string.h> and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Potential issues unrelated to string.h (for example, whether tid_p indexing is within bounds or whether threads_out is NULL) are outside the scope of this specific rule."
