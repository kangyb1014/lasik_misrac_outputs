  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Details:\n- metal_run_noblock: the for loop uses the controlling expression (i < threads). i is modified by the loop and threads is a function parameter, so the expression is not invariant. The if (!tids) test depends on the tids parameter, so it is not invariant.\n- condition (additional code): there are no loops or conditionals with constant/invariant controlling expressions in the shown snippet; calls to metal_run_noblock/metal_run are function calls, not invariant controlling expressions.\n- metal_run: no loop or conditional with an invariant controlling expression is present (it only declares a VLA and calls metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads).\n- No do\u2013while loops or while (1) / constant-true/false controlling expressions are present that would need to be examined for the allowed exceptions.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
