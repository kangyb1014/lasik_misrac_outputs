  "explanation": "1) condition (caller of metal_run_noblock): You must inspect this caller to see what actual arguments it passes for 'threads' and 'tids' (and threads_out). Whether the controlling expressions in metal_run_noblock are invariant depends on whether callers supply constant/compile-time invariant values (or always NULL) for those parameters.  \n\n2) metal_run (caller of metal_run_noblock): Same reason as above \u2014 metal_run is another caller shown in the call graph. You need its prototype and call sites to determine the range/variability of the 'threads' and 'tids' arguments passed into metal_run_noblock.  \n\n3) pthread_create (library function): The loop and the subsequent if(error) depend on the return semantics of pthread_create. You need the prototype and documented return values (0 on success, non-zero error codes on failure) to judge whether the 'error' controlling expression can change across iterations or could be invariant. Also the fact that pthread_create has side-effects (creates new threads) is relevant to whether the controlling expression semantics are properly non-invariant.  \n\n4) metal_thread_t (type of child): Knowing this type (function-pointer signature) helps determine whether the 'child' argument could be a constant/STORATE-class/static function pointer or otherwise invariant across calls; this can affect reasoning about invariance of control expressions when callers always pass the same routine or a constant thread count associated with that routine.  \n\nNote: Inspecting the bodies/signatures of the listed caller functions (condition, metal_run) is the primary requirement \u2014 they will show whether 'threads' or 'tids' are constant/invariant when calling metal_run_noblock. The other symbols give necessary semantic context for the controlling expressions inside metal_run_noblock."
