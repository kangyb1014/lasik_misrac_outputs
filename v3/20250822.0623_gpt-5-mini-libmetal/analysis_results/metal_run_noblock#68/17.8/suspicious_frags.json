  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the shown code. Analysis by parameter:\n- threads (int): only read in the for loop condition; never assigned to.\n- child (metal_thread_t): passed to pthread_create but not assigned or altered.\n- arg (void *): passed to pthread_create but not assigned or altered.\n- tids (void *): tested for NULL and then cast to a local pointer (tid_p). The code never assigns to the tids parameter itself; only the objects pointed into by tid_p (which reference caller-provided storage) are written by pthread_create \u2014 this is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). \n- threads_out (int *): the function writes *threads_out = i; this modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter, which is allowed by the rule. \nOther operations (e.g., assigning to local variable error, using the metal_log macro) do not modify any of the function parameters themselves. Therefore there are no MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 violations to report in this function."
