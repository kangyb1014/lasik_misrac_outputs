  "explanation": "All other code fragments in the function are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Specifically, basic scalar variables and control-flow statements (int error, int i, the for loop, the if (!tids) check, error handling, metal_log calls, strerror usage, break/return statements, and the initialization error = 0) do not declare or use pointer types whose pointee const-qualification could be changed. The macro definition and logging machinery provided in the additional code are not pointer declarations that would be made const-qualified for this rule. Therefore they do not need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
