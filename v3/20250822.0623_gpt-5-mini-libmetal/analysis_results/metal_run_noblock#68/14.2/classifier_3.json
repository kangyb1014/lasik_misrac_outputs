  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_run_noblock:\n```c\nint metal_run_noblock(int threads, metal_thread_t child,\n\t\t     void *arg, void *tids, int *threads_out)\n{\n\tint error, i;\n\tpthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids;\n\n\tif (!tids) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"invalid argument, tids is NULL.\\n\");\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\n\terror = 0;\n\tfor (i = 0; i < threads; i++) {\n\t\terror = -pthread_create(&tid_p[i], NULL, child, arg);\n\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"failed to create thread - %s\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t  strerror(error));\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t*threads_out = i;\n\treturn error;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_run_noblock:\ntypedef void *(*metal_thread_t)(void *)\n...\n#define metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) ({if(_metal.common.log_handler&&level<=_metal.common.log_level)_metal.common.log_handler(level,metal_fmt(fmt),##__VA_ARGS__);\\\n})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < threads; i++) {\n\t\terror = -pthread_create(&tid_p[i], NULL, child, arg);\n\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"failed to create thread - %s\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t  strerror(error));\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this code. The for loop uses a single loop counter i initialized in the first clause (i = 0). The second clause (i < threads) has no persistent side effects and uses only the loop counter and the parameter threads (which is not modified inside the loop body or by the called functions here). The third clause (i++) modifies only the loop counter. A violating scenario would be if the second or third clause referenced an object that is modified in the loop body or by functions called from the body (for example, using a variable in the loop-condition that is updated inside the loop or inside functions called from the loop), e.g. for (i = 0; buf_count > 0; i++) where buf_count is changed in the loop body or by a called function \u2014 that would violate Rule 14.2."
