  "explanation": "Only control statements need checking for invariant controlling expressions. In the provided code the only controlling expressions are the if inside metal_get_timestamp and the if inside the metal_log macro; both are therefore reported. Other fragments do not contain controlling expressions (there are no loops, do-while, switch statements, or other if/conditional operators outside those reported). The NS_PER_S macro and the arithmetic/assignment/return statements are not controlling expressions and thus do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
