  "explanation": "1) clock_gettime prototype: The MISRA rule concerns whether pointers should be const-qualified when possible. The call clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp) passes &tp \u2014 to decide if that pointer could/should be a pointer-to-const you must know the callee's parameter type and whether the function writes through the pointer. The clock_gettime declaration shows whether the second parameter is struct timespec * (non-const) or const struct timespec *.\n\n2) struct timespec definition: Knowing the exact definition of struct timespec (member names and types) is necessary to reason about whether the object pointed to is intended to be written by the callee or could be treated immutable. It also confirms that &tp yields a struct timespec * and helps determine whether const qualification would be semantically appropriate.\n\n3) metal_log prototype and METAL_LOG_ERROR definition: The code passes a string literal to metal_log. To check MISRA's guidance about const qualification of pointer parameters you must see metal_log's parameter types (e.g., whether the message/format parameter is declared const char * or char *). METAL_LOG_ERROR's definition/type is needed to fully understand the metal_log prototype usage. These symbols allow checking whether passing a literal to a non-const parameter would violate the rule or indicate that metal_log itself should have used const."
