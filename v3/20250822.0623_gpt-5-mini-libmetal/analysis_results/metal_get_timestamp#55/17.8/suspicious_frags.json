  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: The function metal_get_timestamp has no parameters (void), so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function. The only pointer usage is the call clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp) where a pointer to a local object (tp) is passed; MISRA 17.8 permits modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter, only the pointer itself must not be modified. There are no assignments to any function parameters, no pointer parameters declared in this function, and no operations that would modify a pointer parameter. Therefore no code fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
