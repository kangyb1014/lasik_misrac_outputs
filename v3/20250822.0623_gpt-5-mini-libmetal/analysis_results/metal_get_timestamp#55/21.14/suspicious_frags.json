  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function metal_get_timestamp and the related macros/definitions included. There are no calls to memcmp, and no use of memcmp-like comparisons against null-terminated strings in the shown code. The NS_PER_S macro is numeric and not string-related. The metal_log macro expands to calls to metal_fmt(fmt) and a log_handler, but neither metal_fmt nor the log_handler implementation was provided; since no memcmp usage appears in the supplied fragments, there are no code fragments here that violate Rule 21.14. If implementations of metal_fmt or the log_handler exist elsewhere, those files should be scanned for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings, but they are not part of the provided code and therefore not included as suspicious fragments."
