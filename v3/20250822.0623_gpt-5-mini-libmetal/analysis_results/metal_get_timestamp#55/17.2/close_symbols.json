  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_get_timestamp violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls you must inspect every function it calls and everything those callees call. Specifically:\n\n- metal_log (definition / implementation or full call-graph): metal_get_timestamp calls metal_log when clock_gettime fails. You must examine metal_log to ensure it does not call metal_get_timestamp (directly) or call some other function that eventually calls metal_get_timestamp (indirect recursion).\n\n- clock_gettime (implementation or full call-graph / platform vDSO wrapper): metal_get_timestamp calls clock_gettime. Although clock_gettime is normally a libc/system call, some platforms provide vDSO or wrapper code that could (theoretically) call back into application code. You need the implementation or call-graph to prove it does not reach metal_get_timestamp.\n\n- metal_log macro expansion (if metal_log is a macro or inline wrapper): metal_log might be a macro or thin wrapper that hides additional function calls. You need the expanded definition to see the actual callees.\n\n- transitive callees of metal_log and clock_gettime (definitions / call-graphs of every function they call): to rule out indirect recursion you must examine the entire transitive closure of callees starting from the two functions above; any function in that closure that calls metal_get_timestamp would constitute an indirect recursion.\n\n(Other symbols present in the source such as struct timespec, CLOCK_MONOTONIC, NS_PER_S and METAL_LOG_ERROR are data/type/macros and are not required to decide whether a recursion exists, but you may include their definitions for completeness.)"
