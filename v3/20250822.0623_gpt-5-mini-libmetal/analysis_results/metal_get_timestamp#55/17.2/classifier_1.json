  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: metal_get_timestamp calls the library function clock_gettime, which is not itself metal_get_timestamp. There is no direct or indirect self-call shown. A specific violation scenario would be if clock_gettime were implemented or aliased to call metal_get_timestamp (e.g. a custom wrapper or macro such that clock_gettime -> metal_get_timestamp -> clock_gettime), which would create indirect recursion, but nothing in the provided fragment indicates that."
