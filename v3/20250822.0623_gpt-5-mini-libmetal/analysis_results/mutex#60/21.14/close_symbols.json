  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for the MISRA memcmp rule analysis:\n- mutex_thread: This is the thread entry function passed into metal_run. It is the most likely place where memcmp could be invoked on data produced/consumed by the test; its body must be inspected to see any memcmp use and whether operands are null-terminated strings.\n- metal_run: The immediate callee that spawns/controls threads. It may itself call memcmp or pass string pointers/lengths into thread contexts; its implementation is needed to see any direct memcmp use or how arguments to mutex_thread are prepared.\n- metal_run_noblock: A function called by metal_run. It may contain memcmp calls or perform comparisons on buffers/strings used by the threads, so it must be checked.\n- metal_finish_threads: Called by metal_run to join/cleanup threads. It could perform comparisons (e.g., validating thread results) using memcmp; include to detect such uses.\n- metal_mutex_init: Direct callee from mutex; while unlikely, it could perform logging or validation that uses memcmp\u2014include to be thorough in the call chain analysis.\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Same rationale as metal_mutex_init; include to ensure no memcmp use occurs during deinitialization.\n- memcmp: The standard library function whose usage is being checked. Its call sites and the exact arguments passed (pointer types and lengths) must be examined to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
