  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine if the target function contains dead code:\n\n- metal_mutex_init\n  - Need the implementation/semantics to know what side-effects the call produces (e.g. allocates or registers resources, sets shared state, is a no-op). If metal_mutex_init has no observable effect on program behaviour, removing the call could be harmless (dead). If it changes global or timing behaviour, removal would affect the system.\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit\n  - Must know whether deinit frees resources, signals other components, or is a no-op. If metal_run never returns then deinit is unreachable (not \"dead\" per note 2) \u2014 or if deinit has no observable effect, it could be dead. Its semantics determine whether removing it changes behaviour.\n\n- metal_run\n  - Core caller that determines control flow: whether it blocks, returns, spawns threads, or never returns. If metal_run never returns, subsequent deinit is unreachable (not dead). If metal_run does not use the provided lock pointer or does not interact with the mutex state, the init/deinit might be removable without changing behaviour. Also need its return/error semantics because mutex returns rc.\n\n- metal_run_noblock\n  - metal_run calls this symbol (per call graph). Its behaviour (e.g. non-blocking thread launch vs. immediate return) affects whether deinit executes and whether init/deinit are necessary for correct concurrent behaviour. If metal_run delegates to metal_run_noblock for certain modes, that implementation detail can change whether operations in mutex are meaningful.\n\n- metal_finish_threads\n  - Also called by metal_run; may perform joins/cleanup that depend on initialization of the mutex or the threads' use of it. If finish synchronizes threads that rely on the mutex, removing init/deinit could change behaviour. Its semantics affect whether parts of mutex are required.\n\n- mutex_thread\n  - The function pointer passed to metal_run. Its use of the provided &lock is crucial: if mutex_thread never uses the mutex, the mutex init/deinit may be redundant (dead). If mutex_thread uses the mutex, its behaviour determines whether init/deinit are necessary for correct operation and whether timing/ordering is affected.\n\n- metal_mutex_t\n  - The type definition and any associated invariants or operations tell whether merely declaring the local lock has side-effects, alignment, or constructor-like behaviour, and whether init/deinit manipulate internal state required by other components. Understanding the type is required to decide whether the init/deinit and passing &lock to metal_run are operationally necessary.\n\nNotes: to fully decide the dead-code question for the mutex function you must inspect the implementation and observable side-effects (including timing and synchronization) of the symbols listed above; also any additional symbols called transitively by those implementations should be considered in the analysis."
