Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function were not flagged because they are clearly control-flow statements, observable operations, or initializations that affect program behavior. Specifically, the remaining lines either (a) perform returns/flow control (whose removal would change behavior), (b) call external functions or perform operations with observable side effects, or (c) are straightforward assignments that initialize state used later. Those kinds of operations are not candidates for dead-code removal without affecting program behavior, so they were not included as suspicious."
