  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the supplied code fragment. I checked for common compiler-specific extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2), including but not limited to: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__ markers, __builtin_ functions, typeof, asm/__asm__ or inline assembly, pragma directives with nonstandard extensions, Microsoft calling-convention keywords (e.g. __stdcall, __cdecl), vendor-specific storage-class specifiers, or other nonstandard keywords. The code only uses standard C constructs: function definition with pointer parameter, pre/post-increment, struct member access, memset from the C library, and returns. Note: the identifier _metal uses a leading underscore; that is a reserved-identifier concern under the C standard but is not a compiler language extension and therefore is outside the scope of Rule 1.2 as requested."
