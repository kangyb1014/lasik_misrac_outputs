Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\n```c\nvoid metal_linux_irq_shutdown(void)\n{\n\tint ret;\n\n\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"%s\\n\", __func__);\n\tirq_handling_stop = true;\n\tmetal_linux_irq_notify();\n\tret = pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL);\n\tif (ret) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"Failed to join IRQ thread: %d.\\n\",\n\t\t\t  ret);\n\t}\n\tclose(irq_notify_fd);\n\tmetal_mutex_deinit(&irq_lock);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\nstatic bool irq_handling_stop\n...\nstatic pthread_t irq_pthread\n...\nstatic int irq_notify_fd\n...\nstatic metal_mutex_t irq_lock\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nirq_handling_stop = true;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the typical/expected use: the assignment irq_handling_stop = true; is intended to signal the IRQ thread to stop (it is followed by metal_linux_irq_notify() to wake the thread and pthread_join() to wait for it), so removing this write would change program behaviour. This is therefore not dead code if the IRQ thread reads irq_handling_stop. Violation scenario: if, contrary to expectation, irq_handling_stop is never read by any executed code (for example the IRQ thread does not check the flag or the flag is unused elsewhere in the translation unit), then the assignment would be dead code because removing it would not affect program behaviour."
