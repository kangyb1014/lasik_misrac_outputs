Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\n```c\nvoid metal_linux_irq_shutdown(void)\n{\n\tint ret;\n\n\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"%s\\n\", __func__);\n\tirq_handling_stop = true;\n\tmetal_linux_irq_notify();\n\tret = pthread_join(irq_pthread, NULL);\n\tif (ret) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"Failed to join IRQ thread: %d.\\n\",\n\t\t\t  ret);\n\t}\n\tclose(irq_notify_fd);\n\tmetal_mutex_deinit(&irq_lock);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_irq_shutdown:\nstatic bool irq_handling_stop\n...\nstatic pthread_t irq_pthread\n...\nstatic int irq_notify_fd\n...\nstatic metal_mutex_t irq_lock\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nclose(irq_notify_fd);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: close(irq_notify_fd) has observable side-effects (releases the OS file-descriptor used for IRQ notification). Removing it would change program behaviour (resource leak, possible interference with later FD allocation or with other code that expects the descriptor to be closed), so it is not dead code. (Only in a contrived case\u2014e.g. irq_notify_fd is always -1 or never opened and never used elsewhere\u2014would the call be effectively a no-op and thus removable.)"
