  "explanation": "The function metal_linux_irq_shutdown has no parameters; Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters, so statements that assign to local/static objects (e.g. irq_handling_stop = true) are not relevant. metal_linux_irq_notify() takes no arguments and cannot violate a parameter-modification rule in this caller. close(irq_notify_fd) passes an integer file descriptor (not a pointer parameter). The only places in this snippet that involve pointer arguments (and thus warrant checking the callee implementations for illegal modification of their pointer parameters) are the three calls listed above. Other fragments do not present potential Rule 17.8 issues within this code fragment."
