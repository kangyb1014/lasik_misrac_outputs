  "explanation": "List of required symbols and why they are needed to decide whether any statements in metal_linux_irq_shutdown are unreachable:\n\n- metal_linux_irq_notify: Must inspect its definition/attributes to know whether it can fail to return (e.g., calls exit(), longjmp(), pthread_exit(), or is marked noreturn). If it does not return, all subsequent statements in metal_linux_irq_shutdown would be unreachable.\n\n- metal_log: The logging macro/function could be implemented as a macro or function that affects control flow (e.g., may call abort/exit/longjmp or be marked noreturn). Verify its implementation/attributes to ensure the calls at the top and inside the error branch do not make following code unreachable.\n\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG and METAL_LOG_ERROR: These macros (or enum values) are used with metal_log; if they are macros that expand to control-flow constructs, they could affect reachability. Include their definitions to fully understand metal_log usage.\n\n- pthread_join: Inspect the pthread_join declaration/attributes in the build environment (e.g., whether it has any nonstandard noreturn attribute or is wrapped by a macro). Knowing its behavior is necessary to determine if execution always continues past the join call.\n\n- close: The close call could be wrapped by a macro or function with nonstandard behavior. Include its declaration/definition to ensure it does not affect reachability.\n\n- metal_mutex_deinit: Although it is the last call, if it is non-returning it could make any code after it unreachable; include its definition to rule that out and to check for macros that change control flow.\n\n- irq_handling_stop: Include the symbol/type/definition to ensure it is not a macro or inline function with control-flow side-effects (e.g., a setter that returns/longjmps). Also useful to see if its write has any conditional compilation that could remove subsequent code.\n\n- irq_pthread: Definition/type of this global (or macro) is needed to ensure its use in pthread_join is valid and that any wrapper does not alter control flow.\n\n- irq_notify_fd: Definition/type (and any wrapper around close) is needed to confirm the close call is not transformed by macros that affect reachability.\n\n- irq_lock: Definition/type is needed to verify the metal_mutex_deinit call signature and whether irq_lock is a macro that could alter control flow.\n\nIn short: include the bodies/declarations/macros for all called functions and for globals/macros referenced in this function so the next analyzer can determine whether any of those symbols can prevent normal return flow and thereby create unreachable statements inside metal_linux_irq_shutdown."
