  "explanation": "Only code that declares or uses pointer types is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The listed fragments include the function parameter and return pointer, the local pointer declaration/initialization, and the calls that pass that pointer to lock APIs \u2014 these should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types could be const-qualified. Other fragments in the function (the loop control, the integer i, the increment of total, the read of spinlock_test_count, and the return NULL) do not declare or use pointer types that would be candidates for const qualification and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
