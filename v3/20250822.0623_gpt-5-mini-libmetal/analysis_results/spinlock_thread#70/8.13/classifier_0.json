  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'l' is a pointer to a mutable spinlock object which is passed to metal_spinlock_release. The release operation (and the corresponding acquire called in the same function) must modify the spinlock state, so the pointee cannot be const. Additionally, the pthread-style thread entry uses void *arg (cannot be const-qualified), so making 'l' point to a const-qualified type is not appropriate here."
