  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The thread takes a void *arg that is converted to struct metal_spinlock * and used with metal_spinlock_acquire()/release(), which modify the lock object; therefore the pointee must not be const. If the function only inspected the pointee without modifying it, declaring a pointer-to-const would be required, but that is not the case here."
