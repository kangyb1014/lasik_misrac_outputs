  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer 'l' is used with metal_spinlock_acquire() and metal_spinlock_release(), which modify the spinlock state, so it must point to a modifiable (non-const) object. Also the thread entry signature requires void *arg, so making it const would be incompatible. If the code did not modify the pointed-to object, then 'struct metal_spinlock *' should be 'const struct metal_spinlock *' and would violate Rule 8.13, but as written there is no violation."
