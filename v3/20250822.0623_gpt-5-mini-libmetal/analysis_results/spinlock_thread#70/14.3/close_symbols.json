  "explanation": "spinlock_test_count \u2014 The loop controlling expression is `i < spinlock_test_count`. To decide if that expression is invariant you must know the declaration/definition of spinlock_test_count (type, storage class, const/volatile qualifiers, initializer) and whether it can be modified (by other translation units, by interrupts, or by functions). If it is a compile-time constant or never changes, the controlling expression might be invariant; if it is volatile or modified elsewhere the expression is not invariant.\n\nmetal_spinlock_acquire \u2014 The callee might have side effects (directly or via globals) that change spinlock_test_count or other variables used in the controlling expression. You need the prototype/definition and any side-effect information to determine whether calls inside the loop can make the controlling expression variant.\n\nmetal_spinlock_release \u2014 Same rationale as for metal_spinlock_acquire: analyze its definition/side effects to see if it can modify spinlock_test_count (or otherwise affect the controlling expression) across iterations.\n\ntotal \u2014 Although not part of the controlling expression, total is modified inside the loop. You need its declaration (type, qualifiers, and whether it aliases or is mapped to the same storage as spinlock_test_count or is volatile) to rule out aliasing/side-effect scenarios that could indirectly affect the loop condition. If total cannot affect spinlock_test_count, it helps conclude the controlling expression is not invariant."
