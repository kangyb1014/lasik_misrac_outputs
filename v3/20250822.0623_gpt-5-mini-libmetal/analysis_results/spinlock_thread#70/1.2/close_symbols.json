  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect not only the function body but the declarations/definitions of the symbols it references, because extension tokens are commonly attached there. Specifically:\n\n- spinlock_test_count: It is referenced in the for loop bound. Its declaration/definition may use non\u2011standard types, storage-class attributes or compiler extension macros (e.g. __extension__, __attribute__, __declspec, atomic builtins). You need the symbol to check for such extensions.\n\n- total: The global increment (total++) may involve a variable declared with extensions (atomic types, bitfields, packed attributes, compiler builtins). Inspecting its declaration reveals any extension use.\n\n- struct metal_spinlock (definition): The pointer argument is typed as struct metal_spinlock *. The struct definition may include implementation extensions (compiler attributes on the struct or fields, non\u2011standard bitfield behavior, anonymous structs/unions, etc.). You must see the definition to spot any extension usage.\n\n- prototype/declaration of metal_spinlock_acquire: The call may be to a function declared with compiler extensions (attributes, calling\u2011convention specifiers, varargs, inline asm in prototype, etc.). The declaration is required to detect such extensions.\n\n- prototype/declaration of metal_spinlock_release: Same reasoning as acquire \u2014 the declaration can contain extension tokens that make the call site non\u2011conforming.\n\n- NULL macro definition (from headers): The function returns NULL. While NULL is normally standard, some projects redefine it or use compiler\u2011specific representations/macros; checking its definition ensures no extension is used here.\n\n- declarations' attached compiler attributes/macros (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__) for the above symbols: Many extensions are expressed as attributes or macros applied to the function/variable/struct declarations rather than inside the body. You must examine any attributes/macros attached to the preceding symbols to determine MISRA\u2011C Language extension violations.\n\nCollecting these symbols/declarations (and the headers/translation\u2011unit scope where they are defined) is sufficient to determine whether the target function or its referenced symbols use language extensions."
