  "explanation": "metal_spinlock_acquire \u2014 need the function declaration or macro definition to confirm its parameter types/definition (or whether it is a macro). This ensures the call metal_spinlock_acquire(l) cannot implicitly modify the function parameter variable (arg) via some unexpected macro or prototype that would change caller-side pointer storage.\nmetal_spinlock_release \u2014 same reason as above for the release call: its declaration/macro/definition must be checked to rule out any expansion or prototype that could modify the parameter variable.\nstruct metal_spinlock \u2014 the type definition is needed to confirm that l is a pointer to an object (so that operations on *l would be allowed to modify the pointed object but not the pointer variable itself) and to detect any unusual typedef/macro that changes the semantics of passing/assigning this type.\nspinlock_test_count \u2014 declaration/type of this global is needed to ensure the loop control has no macro side-effects that could modify the function parameter (e.g. if it were a macro with unexpected expansion). It also confirms the loop is ordinary control flow and does not involve arg.\ntotal \u2014 declaration/type of this global is needed to ensure the increment total++ is a normal modification of a global object and not a macro or inline that could expand to something that modifies the parameter variable.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst verify (1) that no assignment to the formal parameter variable arg occurs, (2) that called routines or macros cannot indirectly alter the parameter variable via unexpected prototypes or macro expansions, and (3) that only the pointed-to object (via l) and external globals are modified \u2014 which is permitted by the MISRA rule."
