  "explanation": "The function spinlock_thread has a single parameter void *arg which is only read and cast to a local pointer (struct metal_spinlock *l = arg;). The code does not assign to or otherwise modify the parameter variable arg itself. Calling metal_spinlock_acquire(l) and metal_spinlock_release(l) may modify the object pointed to by l, which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The return of NULL does not modify the parameter. The global total is modified, but it is not a function parameter and thus not relevant to Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that violate or require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
