  "explanation": "Needed to determine possible out-of-bounds string accesses:\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition, including the declaration/type of bus_name): To know whether bus_name is a char array (with fixed size) or a char* (heap/extern). The element type and size and storage determine whether string functions (strlen/strcpy/etc.) could read/write past the object bounds or rely on NUL termination.\n\n- for_each_linux_bus (macro or iterator implementation): To confirm the lifetime and validity of the lbus pointer and of lbus->bus_name during iteration (e.g. whether the macro creates ephemeral temporaries or different pointer scopes that could affect buffer validity).\n\n- metal_bus_find (prototype and full implementation): The target passes lbus->bus_name into this function. To check MISRA string-rule violations we must inspect metal_bus_find for any uses of string.h functions (strcmp/strncpy/memcpy/strlen/etc.), its assumptions about NUL termination, buffer sizes, and whether it copies into/reads past the provided object.\n\n- metal_bus_unregister (prototype and full implementation): Although called only on success, it should be inspected because it might also use string functions on bus or on names derived from lbus->bus_name; any such uses could constitute a violation originating from the target function's call sequence.\n\n- Any functions that initialise or modify linux_bus->bus_name (e.g. registration/initializer routines): If bus_name is written elsewhere, those writers determine whether the stored name is NUL-terminated and fits its storage; to conclude no out-of-bounds reads by string functions you must verify how the buffer is populated and sized.\n\n(If metal_bus_find or metal_bus_unregister call other helper functions that perform string operations, include those helper implementations as well.)"
