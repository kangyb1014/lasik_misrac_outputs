  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) passes the address of local variable 'bus' so the callee may store into the object pointed-to (allowed by the rule). At the call site no function parameter is being modified and the pointer itself is not being changed here. (Note: if the implementation of metal_bus_find were to modify the pointer parameter value itself rather than the object it points to, that would violate Rule 17.8, but that cannot be determined from this fragment.)"
