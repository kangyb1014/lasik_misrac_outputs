  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The macro for_each_linux_bus expands to a standard for loop and uses pointer arithmetic and struct member access, all standard C. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (for example: no __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC __label__ or other vendor built-ins) and no non-standard array/struct declarations. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
