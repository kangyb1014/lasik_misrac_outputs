  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_bus_finish:\n```c\nvoid metal_linux_bus_finish(void)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_bus(lbus) {\n\t\tif (metal_bus_find(lbus->bus_name, &bus) == 0)\n\t\t\tmetal_bus_unregister(bus);\n\t}\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_bus_finish:\n#define for_each_linux_bus(lbus) for((lbus)=linux_bus;(lbus)->bus_name;(lbus)++)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define for_each_linux_bus(lbus) for((lbus)=linux_bus;(lbus)->bus_name;(lbus)++)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The macro expands to a standard for-loop that uses (lbus)->bus_name as the loop condition and (lbus)++ as the iteration expression; none of the executed operations are removable without changing program behaviour. The condition and pointer increment are required to control iteration, so there is no dead code introduced by this fragment (no operation is executed that could be removed without affecting behaviour)."
