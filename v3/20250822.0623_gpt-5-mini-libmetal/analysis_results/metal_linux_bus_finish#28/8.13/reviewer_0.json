  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. In the shown function lbus is only dereferenced to read fields (lbus->bus_name) and there is no modification of the pointed-to linux_bus object. Therefore, lbus could and should be declared as const struct linux_bus *lbus. The only potential caveat would be if the for_each_linux_bus macro or other uses require lbus to be a non-const pointer (e.g. taking its address for storage into a non-const location), but based on the provided code and execution log there is no evidence of such a requirement. Consequently the report of a violation of Rule 8.13 is correct."
