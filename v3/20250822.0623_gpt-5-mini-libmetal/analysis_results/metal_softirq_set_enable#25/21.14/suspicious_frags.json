  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp (or other C string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) are present in the provided code fragment. The function manipulates integer values (irq, enable) and calls atomic_store; there are no char arrays, char pointers, or operations on null-terminated strings that could involve memcmp. Therefore there are no code locations in this fragment that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
