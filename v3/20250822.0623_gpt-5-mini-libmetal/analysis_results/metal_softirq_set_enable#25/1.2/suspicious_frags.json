  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related symbols for compiler-specific language extensions. The code does not use any of the common compiler extensions that would be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2: there are no GCC/Clang-specific keywords or builtins (for example __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, typeof__, or statement-expression ({ ... })), no inline assembly, no compiler pragmas that are implementation-specific, and no other non-standard language constructs. The atomic_store usage corresponds to the C11 <stdatomic.h> facility (a standard language/library feature), and METAL_IRQ_ENABLE is a simple macro constant (1U). The Doxygen-style comments (/**< ... */) are standard C comments, not a language extension. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments to report for investigation under Rule 1.2."
