  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_softirq_set_enable violates the MISRA rule against self-calls (direct or indirect), the analyzer must know all called symbols and any symbols that could cause calls back into this function: \n\n- atomic_store: This is the only function-like call in the body. You must inspect its declaration/definition to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls metal_softirq_set_enable. If atomic_store is a wrapper function in the same translation unit or project it could create an indirect recursion edge.\n\n- __atomic_store_n (or the compiler builtin / implementation that atomic_store expands to): On many compilers atomic_store is a macro/inline that expands to a compiler builtin or an internal function (e.g., __atomic_store_n or an RTL/library helper). The actual implementation/callees of that builtin must be checked for any calls into project code (and ultimately back to metal_softirq_set_enable).\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled: The array being written must be inspected to confirm its type and initializer. If its elements are ordinary atomic integers, writing them cannot cause a call back. But if the symbol were, for example, an array of objects with assignment side-effects or of function pointers or contained callbacks, storing to it could (via helper functions or overloaded init code in non\u2011C contexts) cause indirect calls. Confirming the declaration rules out that possibility.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: This macro/constant must be checked to ensure it is a plain constant (or simple macro) and not a function-like macro or expression that triggers calls.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition of irq_base and irq_num): The fields used in bounds checks and arithmetic should be inspected to ensure they are plain integer fields and their access does not invoke any function-like behavior (e.g., accessors or macros). This rules out hidden calls via unusual macros or accessor functions that could lead to indirect recursion.\n\nCollecting the definitions/implementations of these symbols (and any functions they in turn call) is sufficient to determine whether any call chain from metal_softirq_set_enable can reach itself."
