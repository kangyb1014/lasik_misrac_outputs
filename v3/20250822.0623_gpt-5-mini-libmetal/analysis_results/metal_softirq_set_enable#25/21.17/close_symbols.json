This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_softirq_set_enable can cause out-of-bounds accesses (the MISRA rule about string.h functions), the analyzer needs: \n\n- metal_softirq_enabled: the array being indexed. You must know its declaration and where it is defined to check whether the computed index (irq - cntr->irq_base) can exceed its bounds.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled element type and its definition: the element type may be a C11 atomic type or a project-specific atomic_t. The element type determines how atomic_store operates (size, alignment) and whether atomic_store's implementation uses functions like memcpy from <string.h>.\n\n- metal_softirq_enabled array size / allocation: the concrete size (or dynamic allocation information) is needed to prove the index is within bounds and to detect any possibility of out-of-bounds writes.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ENABLE: the value compared to enable is needed to confirm which atomic_store branch executes; not strictly about string.h usage but needed for full control-flow analysis.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (full definition): definitions of irq_base and irq_num (and their types) are required to verify the range check correctness and to ensure no integer type/overflow issues allow an out-of-range index.\n\n- atomic_store (declaration and definition / macro expansion): atomic_store is called to write into the array element. Its implementation could call library routines (or inline memcpy) that are subject to the MISRA string.h rule. You must inspect the actual implementation used in this build.\n\n- Platform-specific implementation used by atomic_store (e.g. __atomic_store_n, __sync builtins, or any memcpy used by the atomic wrapper): if atomic_store maps to compiler intrinsics there is no string.h usage; if it maps to a helper that uses memcpy/memset, those usages must be checked for potential out-of-bounds access. \n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations) lets the next analyzer prove whether the index is always inside metal_softirq_enabled bounds and whether any called routine (particularly atomic_store) uses string.h functions in a way that could access out-of-bounds memory."
