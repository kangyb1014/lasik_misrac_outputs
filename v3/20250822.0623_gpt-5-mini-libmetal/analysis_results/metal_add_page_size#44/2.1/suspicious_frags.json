  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are straightforward assignments, array/structure field stores, increments and the final return statement; these are normal, reachable operations conditioned by the preceding checks. There are no unreachable labels, goto targets, or code placed after an unconditional return in the same block other than the intended guarded early returns already listed above. The conditional branches present in the function are input-dependent (based on index, path and shift) and therefore represent reachable code paths under different inputs; they do not constitute statically unreachable code. No other lines contain constant conditions or control-flow constructs that would make subsequent code impossible to reach, so they need not be investigated for MISRA C Rule 2.1 in this function."
