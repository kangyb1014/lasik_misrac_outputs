  "explanation": "To prove absence (or presence) of direct or indirect recursion you must inspect not only the body of metal_io_block_write but every function it can call and every function that could call back into it. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_io_virt: metal_io_block_write directly calls this function; its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) metal_io_block_write.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: the target function reads io->size and io->ops; the region type definition is needed to locate the ops field and understand how callbacks are stored/typed.\n\n- struct/typedef that defines the region->ops (e.g. struct metal_io_ops): the ops structure definition reveals the prototype of block_write (number and types of arguments). This is crucial because if the callback signature differs from metal_io_block_write it may rule out direct self-assignment; conversely, if signatures match some other function could be the source of recursion.\n\n- all functions assigned to region->ops.block_write (implementations of the block_write callback): metal_io_block_write calls the function pointer io->ops.block_write. Any function that can be installed there must be examined to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call metal_io_block_write, which would create indirect recursion.\n\n- sites that initialize/assign io->ops and io->ops.block_write: to find which concrete functions can be called via the callback you must inspect where ops is populated (initializers, constructors, device registration code). Those assignment sites connect the abstract callback slot to concrete implementations that could form recursion.\n\n(Other functions shown as callers of metal_io_virt in the static graph\u2014metal_io_block_read, metal_io_block_set, shmem_child\u2014are not strictly required to check the call path originating from metal_io_block_write unless metal_io_virt calls them; if investigation of metal_io_virt reveals further calls, include those functions too.)"
