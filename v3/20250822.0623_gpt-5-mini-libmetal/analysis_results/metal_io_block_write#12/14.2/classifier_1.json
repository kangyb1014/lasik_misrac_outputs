  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_block_write:\n```c\nint metal_io_block_write(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       const void *restrict src, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tconst unsigned char *source = src;\n\tint retlen;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_write) {\n\t\tretlen = (*io->ops.block_write)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, src, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\twhile ( len && (\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)) ||\n\t\t\t((uintptr_t)source % sizeof(int)))) {\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\t\tptr++;\n\t\t\tsource++;\n\t\t\tlen--;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tsource += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = *(const unsigned int *)source;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; ptr++, source++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr =\n\t\t\t\t*(const unsigned char *)source;\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\tsource += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = *(const unsigned int *)source;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The for loop modifies three objects in the third clause (ptr, source, and len) whereas Rule 14.2 requires only a single loop counter to be modified in the third clause. Specifically, the third clause must modify only the loop counter (and not other objects), and there shall be only one loop counter; here ptr and source are also incremented in the third clause, so the loop is not well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
