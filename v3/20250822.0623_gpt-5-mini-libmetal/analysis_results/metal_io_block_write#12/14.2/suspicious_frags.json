First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only for-statements are in scope for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. This function contains exactly two for statements (listed above) so they are the only fragments that require investigation for compliance with Rule 14.2. Other code fragments in the function are not for-statements and therefore are outside the direct scope of Rule 14.2: the preceding while loop is a while-statement (not a for-statement), the if/return checks and the call to io->ops.block_write are not for-statements, and other single-statement assignments and the atomic_thread_fence call do not constitute for-loops to be evaluated under Rule 14.2. Additionally, any code in called functions (e.g. io->ops.block_write) is not present in this function and would need to be inspected separately if relevant."
