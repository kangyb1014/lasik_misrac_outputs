  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameter declaration and all places where the region pointer is obtained and dereferenced (including the two different casted stores) because these are the locations where pointer const-qualification is most relevant and could be questioned (e.g. whether 'io' could be a pointer to const, or whether any cast removes const). I did not flag other fragments because:\n- The 'src' parameter is already declared const (const void *restrict src) and local 'source' is const unsigned char *, so they follow the rule.\n- The local pointer 'ptr' and the writes through it are used to perform actual modifications to the I/O region; therefore ptr must be a non-const pointer to allow writes and is not a candidate for const-qualification.\n- The casts on the RHS (to const unsigned char */const unsigned int *) preserve constness of the source data; no cast in the function removes const from the source.\n- The block_write callback is invoked with src (const), and the callback signature/behavior is outside this function; it is not evidence of missing const qualification here.\n- The struct metal_io_region fields shown: physmap is already const-qualified; virt is a mutable region base used for writes, so making it const would be inappropriate for functions that write.\nThus the listed fragments are the primary locations that warrant investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
