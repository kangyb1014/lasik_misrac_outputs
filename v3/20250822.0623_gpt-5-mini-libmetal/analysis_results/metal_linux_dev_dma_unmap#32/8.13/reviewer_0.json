Specifically, 'void *virt' could be 'const void *virt' and 'struct metal_io_region *io' could be 'const struct metal_io_region *io' if the implementation never modifies the pointees through these fields (for example when sg entries are only used to describe buffers for DMA mapping/unmapping).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed encourages using const-qualified pointer targets where possible, but a rule violation can only be claimed if it is safe and reasonable to const-qualify the pointer types across the relevant API/usage. In the snippet the function simply forwards the struct metal_sg *sg to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(). That callback and other users of struct metal_sg are outside the shown scope and may legitimately modify the SG entries or the io region through those pointers. In particular, the driver callback prototype will need to accept const types if sg fields were to be made const; changing the local declaration alone would not be correct unless the entire API and all uses permit it. Without a whole-program analysis showing that neither the SG entries nor the pointed-to io regions/virt memory are ever modified, you cannot conclude a definite Rule 8.13 violation. Therefore the agent A report is not correct as presented. Recommended action: perform a project-wide audit of all uses of struct metal_sg and dev_dma_unmap callbacks; if none modify the pointees, update the struct and API to use const-qualified pointer targets."
