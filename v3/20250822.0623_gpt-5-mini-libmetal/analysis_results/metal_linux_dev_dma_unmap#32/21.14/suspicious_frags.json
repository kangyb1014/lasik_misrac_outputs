  "explanation": "I examined all provided code fragments: metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap, to_linux_device, and to_linux_bus (the duplicate definition). None of these fragments perform any string operations or call memcmp; they only perform pointer/container conversions (metal_container_of) and a call through a function pointer (ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap). MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 concerns using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; there are no memcmp calls or string comparisons in the supplied code. The only place that could contain a memcmp is the implementation of the callee (ldrv->dev_dma_unmap), but that implementation is not included in the provided code, so it cannot be marked as part of this analysis."
