  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code. The function metal_linux_dev_dma_unmap only forwards its parameters to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap and does not perform any string operations or buffer copies itself. The helper functions to_linux_device and to_linux_bus use metal_container_of (a pointer/macro-based container retrieval) and do not call string.h functions either. There are no array indexings or manual pointer arithmetic in the shown fragments that involve standard string routines, so no fragments here trigger Rule 21.17."
