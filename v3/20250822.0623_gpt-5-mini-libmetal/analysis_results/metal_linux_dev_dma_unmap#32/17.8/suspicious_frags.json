  "explanation": "No parameter assignment or modification occurs in the function. The parameters (bus, device, dir, sg, nents) are only used as inputs: bus and device are passed to helper functions to produce local pointers (lbus, ldev) and none of the original parameter variables are assigned to or altered. The call ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_unmap(lbus, ldev, dir, sg, nents) passes the parameters (or derived local pointers) to another function; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8, and passing a pointer does not modify the pointer parameter itself. There is no taking of parameter addresses for storage, no reassignments, and no increments/decrements of parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 17.8."
