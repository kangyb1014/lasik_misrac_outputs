  "explanation": "No other fragments require investigation for unreachable-code concerns because the function body contains no conditional statements, no loops, no early returns, and no code following an unconditional transfer-of-control that would be impossible to reach. Each statement in the body is syntactically reachable if the function itself is invoked. Note that runtime issues such as a NULL function pointer or invalid dereference are not instances of \u201cunreachable code\u201d per Rule 2.1 and thus are not flagged here. The only plausible source of unreachable code in this snippet is whether the static function is ever called (i.e. genuinely unused in the translation unit), which is why the function definition/call sites were reported for investigation. No other code in the provided snippet meets the definition of code that can never be executed."
