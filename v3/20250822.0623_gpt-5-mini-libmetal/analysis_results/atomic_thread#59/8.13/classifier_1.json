  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function parameter 'arg' is converted to 'atomic_int *c' and the pointed object is modified via atomic_fetch_add(c, 1). Since the function intentionally modifies the object, the pointer must not be to a const-qualified type. Therefore making the pointee const would be incorrect. This means Rule 8.13 (use const-qualified pointers whenever possible) is not violated in this code."
