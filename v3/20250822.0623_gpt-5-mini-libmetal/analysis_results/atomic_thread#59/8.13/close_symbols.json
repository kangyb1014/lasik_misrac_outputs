  "explanation": "atomic_int: need the typedef/definition to know the exact underlying type (e.g. typedef _Atomic int) and whether it already carries any const/atomic qualifiers. This determines whether a pointer-to-atomic_int should or could be declared const. atomic_fetch_add: need the function/macro prototype and semantics (parameter types and whether it modifies the pointed object). If its first parameter is a non-const atomic_int * and it performs modification, the pointer cannot be const, so no MISRA violation for using void * -> atomic_int *. atomic_test_count: the external loop control variable; its type/constness is needed to check whether the function only reads external state (helps reasoning about whether the function could accept a pointer-to-const). NULL: the definition/type of NULL (macro) to confirm return compatibility with void * (not directly about pointer-to-const but required to fully reason about pointer usage in the function)."
