  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for unreachable code: the local declarations (atomic_int *c = arg; and int i;) and the final return statement are reachable in normal control flow. The provided snippet contains no unconditional jumps, no conditional compilation in the fragment shown, nor other constructs (e.g. an infinite loop or a return before these lines) that would make subsequent statements unreachable. The listed fragments are provided so the project-wide context (for example whether the static function is ever referenced and the actual value/definition of the constant) can be checked to determine whether any code is unreachable."
