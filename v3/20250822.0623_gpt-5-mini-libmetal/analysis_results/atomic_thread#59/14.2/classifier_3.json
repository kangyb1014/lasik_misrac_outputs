  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of atomic_thread:\n```c\nstatic void *atomic_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\tatomic_int *c = arg;\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)\n\t\tatomic_fetch_add(c, 1);\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function atomic_thread:\nstatic const int atomic_test_count = 1000\n...\nvoid *arg\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Clause 1 initializes the loop counter (i = 0). Clause 2 is i < atomic_test_count which has no persistent side effects, uses only the loop counter and a const object (atomic_test_count) that is not modified in the loop body. Clause 3 is i++ which modifies only the loop counter. There is a single loop counter (i) and it is not modified in the loop body (the body calls atomic_fetch_add on a different object)."
