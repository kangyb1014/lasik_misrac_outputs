  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 concerns use of the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided code contains no occurrences of memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp, strncmp) and has no character pointers, char arrays, or null-terminated string handling. The function atomic_thread only operates on an atomic_int via atomic_fetch_add in a loop and returns NULL; the additional symbol atomic_test_count is an integer constant. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere, it is not present in the given excerpts and would need to be supplied for review."
