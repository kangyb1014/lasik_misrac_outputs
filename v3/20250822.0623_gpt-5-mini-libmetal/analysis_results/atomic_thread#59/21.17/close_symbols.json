This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  ],
  "explanation": "To decide if atomic_thread can violate the MISRA C rule about use of <string.h> functions you must check not only the small loop here but any code it invokes and the memory objects it touches:\n\n- atomic_fetch_add: The target function's only call. If atomic_fetch_add (or its wrapper/implementation) uses any string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, etc.) or performs pointer arithmetic that could access beyond the object, that would create a rule violation. You must inspect this symbol's implementation/definition.\n\n- transitive callees of atomic_fetch_add: atomic_fetch_add may be a thin wrapper that delegates to runtime/library helpers or intrinsics. Any function called (directly or indirectly) by atomic_fetch_add must be checked for use of string.h functions or out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- atomic_int (type definition/layout/size): If atomic_fetch_add performs memory operations on the object (for example via memcpy/memmove or by treating the object as a larger buffer), you need the exact type size and layout to judge whether any such memory accesses would exceed the object bounds.\n\n- atomic_test_count: The loop bound controls how many times atomic_fetch_add is called. While the loop count alone does not cause string.h violations, an extremely large or incorrect count could reveal overflow or logic that interacts with called functions in ways that matter; include it to fully understand the calling pattern and to rule out any pathological behavior in callee implementations.\n\n- callers that create/allocate/initialize the atomic_int object passed as arg: The provenance and size of the object pointed to by arg (where atomic_int *c comes from) are required to determine if any memory operation performed on *c by atomic_fetch_add (or its callees) stays within the allocated object bounds. Inspect the allocation/initialization sites (thread creation code or any code that passes arg) to know the object's actual size and lifetime.\n\nInspecting these symbols (and their definitions/implementations) is sufficient to determine whether this target function (via its calls) can invoke any of the <string.h> functions or otherwise perform out-of-bounds accesses protected by that MISRA rule."
