  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying a function parameter (the pointer itself); in atomic_thread the parameter arg is only read, not assigned to. The line \"atomic_int *c = arg;\" initializes a local pointer from arg but does not modify arg itself. The call atomic_fetch_add(c, 1) may modify the object pointed to by c (which is permitted), but it does not modify the pointer parameter. The return statement and the loop variable i only use local objects. Therefore there are no places in this function where the pointer parameter is modified and no further investigation under Rule 17.8 is required."
