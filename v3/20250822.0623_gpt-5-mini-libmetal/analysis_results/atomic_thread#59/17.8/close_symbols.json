  "explanation": "atomic_fetch_add: The prototype/declaration of this function is required to determine what it modifies. In particular we need to know its parameter types (e.g. whether it takes atomic_int * or atomic_int **, whether any pointer parameters are non-const) to decide if the call modifies the pointer parameter passed into atomic_thread or only the object pointed-to (the latter is permitted by the MISRA rule).\n\natomic_int: The typedef/definition of atomic_int is required to know whether atomic_int is an object type (e.g. _Atomic int or typedef to a scalar) or a pointer type. If atomic_int were itself a pointer type, the assignment atomic_int *c = arg and the subsequent call could imply modification of pointer values rather than pointees; the exact type is needed to judge compliance.\n\natomic_test_count: The declaration/type of this global is needed to confirm the loop control is a simple read-only use and does not cause any indirect modification of the function parameter. It also helps ensure no side effects from evaluating the loop bound that could affect the parameter.\n\nNULL: The definition of NULL (macro/constant) is required to confirm the return NULL statement is merely returning a null pointer constant and does not alias or modify the incoming parameter. This is a minor symbol but ensures the return expression does not contravene the rule."
