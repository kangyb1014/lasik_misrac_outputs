  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 were found. The only controlling expression in the provided code is the for-loop condition: \"for (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++)\". Although atomic_test_count is a compile-time constant (1000), the controlling expression is not invariant because it depends on the loop variable i which is initialized and incremented each iteration; therefore the condition changes and does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no other loops or conditional controlling expressions in the function to inspect. Note: if atomic_test_count were 0, the condition would be a compile-time invariant false and would merit investigation, but the provided definition sets atomic_test_count to 1000, so that situation does not apply here. Other statements (casting arg to atomic_int*, the call to atomic_fetch_add, and the return NULL) do not involve controlling expressions and are not relevant to Rule 14.3."
