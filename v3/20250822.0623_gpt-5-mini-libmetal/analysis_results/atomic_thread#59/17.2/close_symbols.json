  "explanation": "- atomic_fetch_add: The target function directly calls atomic_fetch_add; you must inspect its definition (or macro) to determine whether it calls, directly or indirectly, atomic_thread.\n- atomic_test_count: Although used only as a loop bound, it might be a macro or accessor that expands to or calls functions; confirm it is not a function that could lead back to atomic_thread.\n- __atomic_fetch_add and __sync_fetch_and_add: atomic_fetch_add is often implemented as a macro that expands to compiler built\u2011ins or wrappers (these common intrinsics). Check these symbols because recursion could occur through such expansions or their helper functions.\n- (all callees of atomic_fetch_add): If atomic_fetch_add calls other functions, you must examine those callees (and their callees transitively) to ensure none calls atomic_thread.  In short: inspect the full implementation chain reachable from atomic_fetch_add to prove absence of direct or indirect self\u2011calls."
