  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_device_open (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect: \n\n- metal_bus_find: metal_device_open calls this; metal_bus_find might perform name comparisons (e.g. using memcmp) on the null-terminated bus_name or dev_name. Inspecting its implementation is required.\n\n- struct metal_bus: to know how bus instances store their ops and names; needed to trace where name comparisons might occur or how dev lookup is implemented.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (metal_bus->ops and dev_open): metal_device_open uses bus->ops.dev_open. You must examine the ops structure to find the dev_open pointer and understand what implementations can be called and whether they perform illegal memcmp on dev_name (a null-terminated string).\n\n- dev_open implementations (functions assigned to metal_bus_ops.dev_open via metal_bus_register): these are invoked with dev_name by metal_device_open. Any of those implementations could use memcmp on the passed null-terminated dev_name; you must inspect each registered dev_open to ensure none use memcmp for string comparison.\n\n- metal_bus_register: this is the place where bus ops (including dev_open) are typically installed/registered. Inspecting it (and registration sites) helps locate which dev_open implementations are reachable from metal_device_open and therefore must be checked for memcmp usage.\n\n- memcmp: include the standard memcmp symbol so the analyzer can search for any uses of memcmp in metal_bus_find, in any dev_open implementations, and elsewhere in the reachable code paths called by metal_device_open.\n\n- strlen: metal_device_open already calls strlen on bus_name and dev_name; include strlen to confirm it is used for length checks (which is acceptable) and to ensure no misinterpretation (the rule is specifically about memcmp on null-terminated strings, not strlen).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer follow both the direct call (metal_bus_find) and the dynamic call (bus->ops.dev_open) paths to check for any uses of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings reachable from metal_device_open."
