  "explanation": "- struct metal_bus: needed to see the layout of the 'bus' object (the 'ops' member) so we can determine whether the controlling expression 'bus->ops.dev_open' is a genuine runtime-varying pointer or effectively constant (invariant) for all bus instances.\n- struct metal_bus_ops: required to inspect the 'dev_open' member type and any default/static initializers of ops structures. If dev_open is stored in a statically-initialized ops table it might be invariant; we must inspect those definitions.\n- metal_bus_find: the function that returns the 'bus' pointer used in the checks. Its implementation tells us whether different/variable bus instances can be returned (so the controlling test on bus->ops.dev_open is non\u2011invariant) or whether it always returns the same bus/ops pointer.\n- metal_bus_register: a caller likely responsible for creating and initializing metal_bus instances and wiring up ops/dev_open. We must examine where ops.dev_open is assigned to determine if the dev_open pointer can vary at runtime or is always NULL/non-NULL (invariant).\n- metal_linux_bus_finish: another caller in the static call graph that may create or modify bus/ops data; it must be checked for any initialization or assignment that would make bus->ops.dev_open invariant.\n- strlen: the controlling expressions use strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name). We must confirm the behaviour and that these calls depend on the pointed-to data (i.e., are not constant/invariant in the build) and that calls are not optimized to a constant; having the declaration/definition/context is needed to reason about whether those expressions are effectively invariant.\n\nThese symbols allow the next analyst to trace where the values tested in the if-expressions (NULL checks and strlen results) originate and whether they can be considered invariant, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule on invariant controlling expressions."
