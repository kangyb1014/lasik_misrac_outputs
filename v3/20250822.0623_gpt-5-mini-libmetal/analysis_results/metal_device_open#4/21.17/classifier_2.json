  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: in the full expression (!bus_name || !strlen(bus_name) || ...), the left-to-right short-circuit evaluation of the || operator ensures strlen(bus_name) is only called if bus_name is non-NULL. Therefore this fragment does not itself cause an out-of-bounds access. (Note: if bus_name is non-NULL but not a NUL-terminated string, strlen could still read beyond the object bounds \u2014 that is a separate precondition/usage issue, not a consequence of this fragment's ordering.)"
