  "explanation": "metal_bus_find (prototype): needed to see the exact parameter type for the bus_name argument (e.g. whether it is declared as const char * or char *). That determines whether passing the const char *bus_name here is consistent or discards const qualification.\n\nstruct metal_bus (definition): needed to inspect the ops member and its type so we can locate the dev_open member and its declared signature.\n\nstruct metal_bus_ops / type of bus->ops (definition): needed to obtain the declaration of dev_open (and any related members) so we can check the const qualifiers on its parameters.\n\ndev_open function-pointer prototype (the type of bus->ops.dev_open): required to determine whether dev_open expects a const-qualified dev_name and what qualifiers it expects for the device out-parameter (struct metal_device **). This directly affects whether the target function should use different const qualifications.\n\nstruct metal_device (definition): required to determine whether the pointed-to metal_device type itself should be const-qualified (e.g. whether APIs treat it as immutable) and to reason whether metal_device **device should instead be pointer-to-const forms.\n\n(These symbols provide the type information needed to decide if any pointer parameters in metal_device_open should be more const-qualified to comply with the MISRA rule.)"
