  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations and types it relies on, not just the function body. Each listed symbol is required for that inspection:\n\n- strlen: The function calls strlen. You need its declaration/definition (usually in <string.h>) to check for any nonstandard/implementation-specific attributes or extensions (e.g. inline, builtin, typeof usage) that could make the call use a compiler extension.\n\n- EINVAL, ENODEV: These are macros/constants used as return values. Their definitions (usually in <errno.h>) must be checked to ensure they are not implemented via nonstandard extension mechanisms or macros that rely on compiler-specific behavior.\n\n- metal_bus_find: The function calls metal_bus_find. Its prototype/definition must be examined for any compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__, nested function constructs, statement expressions) or nonstandard linkage that would imply use of language extensions affecting this call.\n\n- struct metal_bus: The code dereferences bus->ops. You need the full definition of struct metal_bus to inspect the ops member, and to ensure the structure itself does not use extensions (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, packed/aligned attributes, zero-length arrays, flexible array members with compiler-specific extensions, etc.).\n\n- metal_bus.ops (type of ops member, e.g. struct metal_bus_ops): The ops member's type must be inspected to determine whether it contains any nonstandard constructs or attributes (packed, aligned, __attribute__ markers, compiler-specific calling conventions) that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- ops.dev_open (declaration / function-pointer type): The code calls (*bus->ops.dev_open)(...). You must see the exact declaration of dev_open (the function-pointer type) to check for any nonstandard function-pointer attributes, calling-convention specifiers, nested-function usage, or other extensions attached to the pointer or its target.\n\n- struct metal_device: The target parameter type must be checked for any nonstandard features in its definition (e.g. GCC extensions in type definitions, attributes on the type or members) that would mean the target function depends on language extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their headers/prototypes/definitions) lets you inspect all external declarations the function depends on to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used."
