  "explanation": "- metal_bus_find: needed to verify that calling metal_bus_find does not modify any of the target function's parameters (particularly bus_name or dev_name) or perform any unexpected side\u2011effects that could be interpreted as modifying a parameter. Analyze its prototype/implementation to confirm it only reads bus_name and only returns a bus via the out-parameter.\n- struct metal_bus and its ops (e.g. struct metal_bus_ops): required to see the type of the ops.dev_open member and to confirm that bus->ops.dev_open is a function pointer (not a macro or something that could rewrite the local parameter variables).\n- dev_open function pointer type/signature and the concrete functions assigned to it: to confirm the parameter types accepted by dev_open (e.g. whether it takes struct metal_device **) and to inspect the actual implementations that may be invoked. This shows whether the call (*bus->ops.dev_open)(..., device) can legally modify the object pointed to by device (allowed) and to ensure there is no construct that would reassign the local parameter variable device inside this function via macro/inline expansion.\n- struct metal_device: to confirm the pointer depth (struct metal_device ** in the prototype) so you can distinguish between modifying the object pointed to (*device, allowed) versus reassigning the pointer parameter device itself (disallowed).\n- strlen declaration: to confirm strlen takes a const char * (reads the string) and therefore calling strlen(bus_name) / strlen(dev_name) does not modify bus_name/dev_name.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyzer determine whether any assignment or side-effect in metal_device_open reassigns its parameter variables (bus_name, dev_name, device) versus modifying the objects they point to (which is permitted by the rule)."
