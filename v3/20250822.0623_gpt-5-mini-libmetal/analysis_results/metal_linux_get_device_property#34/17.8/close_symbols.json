  "explanation": "1) to_linux_device: The direct callee that takes the 'device' parameter. You must see its definition (function or macro) to ensure it does not perform any assignment to the caller-supplied parameter (for example, a macro that mutates the passed identifier). If to_linux_device is a macro or inline helper it could conceivably perform side-effects that look like modification of the parameter identifier in the caller.  \n\n2) struct metal_device: The type of the 'device' parameter. Its definition is required to determine whether any implementation-specific semantics (e.g. unusual macros or type-aliasing) could cause the function to modify the parameter itself rather than only the pointed-to object. It also helps confirm whether the parameter is actually a plain pointer (passed by value) as assumed.  \n\n3) struct linux_device (and the nested sdev/path member declarations): The result of to_linux_device is assigned to a struct linux_device pointer and its members are accessed (ldev->sdev->path). The definitions of these structs (in particular the sdev member and path) are needed to check whether those accesses involve any macros or accessor functions that could mutate the original 'device' parameter identifier.  \n\n4) (any) container_of / to_linux_device macro definition: If to_linux_device is implemented via a macro such as container_of or as an inline macro-wrapper, you need that macro definition to inspect whether it expands to code that has side effects on the parameter token (e.g., hidden assignments).  \n\nNote: Standard library/syscall functions used here (snprintf, open, read, close) only operate on the objects pointed to (or return values) and cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables themselves; inspecting their standard prototypes is not necessary to decide the MISRA rule violation in this function. The symbols listed above are the ones that could plausibly cause modification of the function parameters themselves."
