  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The conditional checks present are all dependent on runtime values or function return values: - if (fd < 0) depends on the result of open(path, ...). - if (read(fd, output, len) < 0) depends on the result of read(...). - the ternary return status < 0 ? -errno : 0 depends on the result of close(fd) stored in status. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant conditions, and no if/conditional expressions using compile-time constants (e.g., if (1) or if (0)). The const-qualified flag and mode variables are not used as controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
