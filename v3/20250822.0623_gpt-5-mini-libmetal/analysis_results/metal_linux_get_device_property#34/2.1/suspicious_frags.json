  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function or the related helper. Rationale:\n- There are no statements following unconditional returns (each return ends the function). Every conditional (fd < 0, read(...) < 0) has both reachable true and false paths handled by code that either returns or proceeds to close and then return.\n- There are no infinite loops, no gotos, no compile-time-constant conditionals that would make subsequent code impossible to reach.\n- The helper to_linux_device simply returns a container_of result and is reachable from the caller.\n- All statements (snprintf, open, read, close, final return) are on possible execution paths depending on runtime results from open/read/close; none are statically unreachable.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want checks for related issues (e.g., error-handling correctness, use of errno, or potential snprintf truncation), indicate that and I will list fragments for those investigations."
