  "explanation": "I listed every function call (and the helper that performs a container_of) present in the target code: to_linux_device (and its use of metal_container_of), snprintf, open, read, and close. These are the only locations where a call could produce direct or indirect recursion back into metal_linux_get_device_property. Other parts of the code are simple declarations, assignments, error handling, buffer manipulation, and return statements that do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion; they do not need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 17.2."
