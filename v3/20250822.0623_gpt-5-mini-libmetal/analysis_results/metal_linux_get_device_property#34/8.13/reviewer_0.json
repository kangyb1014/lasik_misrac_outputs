According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be const-qualified when possible \u2014 e.g. 'const struct metal_device *device'.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 indeed recommends that a pointer parameter should be declared to point to a const-qualified type when the function does not modify the object pointed to. At first glance metal_linux_get_device_property does not modify *device and so could appear to satisfy the condition for using const.\n\nHowever, whether a violation actually exists depends on the wider context (the declarations of to_linux_device and any other functions called with device). If to_linux_device (or other called functions) is declared to take a non-const struct metal_device * then the function signature cannot be changed to const without breaking the API or requiring casts. MISRA permits non-const if making it const is not feasible (for example because of incompatible prototypes in the program or because the pointer is passed to functions that require a non-const parameter). The supplied code snippet alone does not prove that such a change is possible. Therefore the agent A's blanket claim that this code violates Rule 8.13 is not justified on the evidence shown.\n\nIf you can show that to_linux_device and all other uses accept a const-qualified pointer (i.e. their prototypes could be changed or already accept const), then the rule would be applicable and the parameter should be const. But given only the posted function, we cannot conclude there is a violation.\n"
