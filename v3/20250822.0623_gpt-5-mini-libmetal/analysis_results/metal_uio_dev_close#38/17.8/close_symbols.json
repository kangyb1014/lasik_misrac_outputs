  "explanation": "To determine compliance with the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified' we must know whether the code modifies the parameter variables themselves (ldev, lbus) or only the objects they point to, and whether any called macros/functions could have hidden side effects that alter the parameters. Specifically:\n\n- struct linux_device (complete definition): needed to see the declaration of the formal parameter's pointee type so we can tell which assignments in the body (ldev->override = NULL, ldev->sdev = NULL, close(ldev->fd), and modifications via ldev->device.regions[\u2026]) are modifications of the pointee object (allowed) versus any direct assignment to the parameter variable ldev itself (disallowed).\n\n- definition of nested 'device' member and its region type (e.g., struct linux_device::device and struct region): required to confirm that accesses like ldev->device.regions[i].virt/size refer to subobjects of the pointee (so modifying those subobjects would not be an assignment to the parameter variable) and to check whether any of those fields are, e.g., macros or special accessor functions.\n\n- types of fields 'override' and 'sdev' (their typedefs / struct definitions): to confirm these fields are members of the pointee object (and are pointer or object types) so assigning NULL to them modifies the object pointed to by ldev rather than the parameter variable ldev itself.\n\n- prototype or macro definition of metal_unmap: to ensure metal_unmap is not a macro or inline function that could rewrite its argument expression in a way that assigns to ldev itself (e.g., via unusual macro expansion). Also to confirm it does not expect/perform modifications that would count as modifying the parameter variable of metal_uio_dev_close.\n\n- prototype or macro definition of sysfs_write_attribute and sysfs_close_device: same reason as above \u2014 ensure these identifiers are functions (not macros that could re-evaluate or reassign the ldev expression) and to check for any side effects that might modify the parameter variable.\n\n- prototype or macro definition of close: to verify it's the standard function or a macro and that the call close(ldev->fd) cannot expand into code that assigns to ldev.\n\n- struct linux_bus (complete definition): although the code casts (void)lbus, the bus parameter is still a formal parameter; include its definition to be certain there are no macros/attributes that would make (void)lbus behave unexpectedly or to check whether the parameter is actually a reference-like wrapper that might be modified elsewhere.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyzer determine unambiguously whether only the pointed-to object is modified (permitted) or whether the function parameter variables themselves are altered (a violation)."
