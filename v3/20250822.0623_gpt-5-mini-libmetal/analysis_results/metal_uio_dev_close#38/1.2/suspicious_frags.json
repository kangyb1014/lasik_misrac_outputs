  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. The code uses only standard C constructs: a local variable declaration, a for loop, pointer/structure member accesses, function calls, a cast to void to suppress an unused-parameter warning, and assignments. There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), builtins, extended designated initializers, or other compiler-specific keywords or pragmas visible in the snippets. POSIX library calls (close) and project-specific types/macros (PATH_MAX, metal_phys_addr_t, METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS) are not language extensions per the rule and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. If additional source outside the shown fragments contains compiler-specific constructs, those should be reported when available."
