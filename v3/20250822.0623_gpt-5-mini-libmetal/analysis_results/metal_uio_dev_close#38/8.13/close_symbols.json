  "explanation": "To check MISRA's \"pointer should point to const whenever possible\" for metal_uio_dev_close we must know the exact types and const-qualification of all pointer objects passed or stored and the prototypes of the functions they are passed to:\n\n- struct linux_device: The full struct is required to see member types and pointer qualifiers (override, sdev, device).\n- struct linux_device.device (type and layout): The nested device object type is needed to find num_regions and regions' element type.\n- struct linux_device.device.num_regions: Needed to understand the loop bounds and the array access semantics (not a pointer constness issue itself, but required to locate region elements).\n- struct linux_device.device.regions (array element type): Must know the element type so we can inspect the types of region fields.\n- regions[].virt (the type/qualifiers of the virt pointer): Critical \u2014 this is the pointer passed to metal_unmap; we must know whether virt is declared as void *, const void *, char *, const char *, etc., to determine if it should be const-qualified or already is.\n- regions[].size (type): To fully reproduce the call and ensure correct prototype matching (size_t vs other integer types can affect API contracts).\n- metal_unmap (prototype/signature): Needed to know the parameter types and whether metal_unmap modifies the memory pointed to; if metal_unmap's parameter could be declared const (i.e., it does not modify pointed-to data), MISRA would prefer const qualification either at the callee or caller side.\n- ldev->override (type of override member): The pointer passed to sysfs_write_attribute \u2014 we must know its declared type and constness to decide if it should be const-qualified.\n- sysfs_write_attribute (prototype/signature): To see whether the function expects a const pointer for the buffer/attribute; if it accepts const char * (or similar), passing a non-const pointer might be an issue in the opposite direction, or the member might need const.\n- ldev->sdev (type of sdev member): Passed to sysfs_close_device; exact type/qualifiers are required to see whether the pointer should be const.\n- sysfs_close_device (prototype/signature): To determine whether sdev should be const-qualified by the API or if it is intended to be a mutable handle.\n- close (prototype from the platform headers): Included for completeness; close takes an int and does not involve pointers, so it does not affect pointer constness, but having its prototype confirms no pointer issues here.\n\nProviding these symbols lets the next agent determine whether any pointers used in metal_uio_dev_close are missing const qualifiers (either in the struct declarations or in the called function prototypes), and whether the calls themselves violate MISRA guidance on const-qualified pointers."
