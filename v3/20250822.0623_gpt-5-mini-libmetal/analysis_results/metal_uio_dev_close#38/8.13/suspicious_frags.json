  "explanation": "The fragments not listed have been reviewed and are not considered suspicious for Rule 8.13 for the following reasons: \n- The function modifies fields of *ldev* (assigns ldev->override = NULL, ldev->sdev = NULL and uses/updates/inspects ldev->fd), so the pointer-to-ldev cannot be a pointer-to-const; therefore the function parameter struct linux_device *ldev is not a violation and need not be investigated further.\n- The assignments ldev->override = NULL; and ldev->sdev = NULL explicitly change the pointer members, so their pointee types cannot be const-qualified in this context.\n- The close(ldev->fd) call operates on an integer file descriptor (not a pointer), so Rule 8.13 is not applicable.\n- Local loop variable declarations and the for-loop control (unsigned int i; for (i = 0; i < ldev->device.num_regions; i++) { ... }) do not involve pointer-to-pointee const-qualification and are therefore not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The (void)lbus; statement indicates the lbus parameter is unused; while making unused parameters const can be considered, any change must be validated across callers. That use is not flagged here as a definite Rule 8.13 violation.\n\nThe listed suspicious fragments should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types (the pointees passed into metal_unmap/sysfs_* and the struct member types) could/should be const-qualified according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
