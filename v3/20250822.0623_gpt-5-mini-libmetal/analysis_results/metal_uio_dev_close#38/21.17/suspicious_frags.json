  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The fragments present are calls to metal_unmap, sysfs_write_attribute, sysfs_close_device and close; none are standard <string.h> functions. The use of the string literal \"\" passed to sysfs_write_attribute is not itself a use of a <string.h> routine. The loop that iterates over ldev->device.regions calls metal_unmap with a pointer and a size, but that call is to a non-standard helper (not a <string.h> function) and would need separate inspection if its implementation uses string functions. Based on the provided code fragment alone, there are no direct violations of Rule 21.17 to investigate."
