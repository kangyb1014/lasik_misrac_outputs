  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided code fragments. The producer_thread function only manipulates a counter and uses metal mutex/condition APIs. The metal_condition_wait implementation uses atomics, mutex operations and a futex syscall \u2014 none are string-handling calls. The shown macros/definitions (METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE, METAL_CONDITION_INIT) and the constant COUNTER_MAX are declarations/initializers with no visible string.h usage in the provided excerpts. Therefore, there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If any omitted macros or other code (e.g., the definitions of METAL_CONDITION_INIT or any other helper functions) contain calls to <string.h> functions, those specific definitions should be supplied for review; based on the code shown, no suspicious fragments exist."
