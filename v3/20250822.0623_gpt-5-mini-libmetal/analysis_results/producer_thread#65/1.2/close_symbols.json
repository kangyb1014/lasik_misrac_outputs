  "explanation": "For determining whether producer_thread uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any referenced symbols whose declarations/definitions can themselves contain extensions (attributes, inline asm, compiler-specific keywords, GCC/Clang builtins, typeof, __extension__, non-standard macros, etc.).\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire, metal_condition_wait, metal_condition_signal, metal_mutex_release: their prototypes or definitions may be macros or functions annotated with compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__, inline asm) or implemented as non\u2011standard inline/extension constructs. Inspecting their declarations/definitions is required to know whether calling them makes the target use language extensions or whether their names are macros that expand to extensions.\n\n- lock, nfull_condv, nempty_condv: the variable definitions and their types may be declared using non\u2011standard extensions (e.g. anonymous structs, bit\u2011fields with extension syntax, section/attribute annotations). The producer_thread operates on these globals, so their declarations must be checked.\n\n- counter, COUNTER_MAX: the type/definition of counter or the macro/constant COUNTER_MAX might use non\u2011standard constructs (e.g. typeof, computed-goto macros, extension macros). COUNTER_MAX may be a macro that expands to extension syntax.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (mutex type), metal_cond_t (condition-variable type): the underlying typedefs/structs used for lock/cond variables can contain extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous unions/structs, compiler-specific qualifiers). You need their definitions to rule out use of extensions.\n\n- headers/macros that define the metal_* API (e.g. metal.h and any METAL_* macros): many portability/visibility macros or API wrappers hide compiler-specific extensions. Examining the header(s) that declare the metal API and any macros used in the prototypes is necessary to detect use of language extensions.\n\nOnly by examining these declarations/definitions can you conclude whether producer_thread itself (via its signature, casts, or calls) uses language extensions as defined by the MISRA rule."
