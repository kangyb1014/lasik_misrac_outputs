  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm/asm, __volatile__ keywords beyond standard, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) or the GCC nested-functions or labels-as-values extensions.\n- The use of uintptr_t and integer types is standard (stdint.h). The atomic APIs (atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub) correspond to the C11 stdatomic facility (standard, not a compiler extension).\n- The syscall(SYS_futex, ...) and FUTEX_WAIT are OS-specific system call usage (Linux-specific), but they are not C language compiler extensions and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C:2012 Rule 1.2 as described (which targets language/compiler extensions).\n- Macro uses (METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE, METAL_CONDITION_INIT) are ordinary preprocessor macros; no evidence in the shown code that they expand to compiler-specific extension constructs.\n- Standard thread function signature (static void *func(void *)) and (void)arg cast to suppress unused-parameter warnings are standard C idioms, not extensions.\n\nGiven the provided fragments, there are no explicit compiler language extensions to report for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
