  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The statement '(void)arg;' is an evaluated expression statement with no side effects. Removing it would not change the runtime behaviour of the program (it only suppresses a compiler/analysis warning), so under the literal wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 it meets the definition of dead code (an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour). It is not unreachable code (it is executed), so Rule 2.2 applies. Therefore the report that this line violates Rule 2.2 is correct. \n\nNote: In practice teams often justify such constructs (or use alternatives such as omitting the parameter name in the function prototype, compiler-specific unused attributes, or a documented deviation) to suppress warnings while conforming to the intent of the standard, but that is a conformity/deviation decision outside the strict wording of Rule 2.2."
