  "explanation": "- lock: need the declaration/type of the mutex object to know whether &lock yields a pointer to a mutable type and whether the mutex API requires a non-const pointer (affects whether the address should or can be const-qualified).\n- nfull_condv / nempty_condv: the declarations/types of the condition variables are required to determine if &nfull_condv and &nempty_condv produce pointers that must be non-const (condition APIs typically modify these objects).\n- counter / COUNTER_MAX: the type of counter is needed to see whether any pointer-related constness rules apply to operations on counter (less likely, but included for completeness) and to confirm that no pointer-to-counter is used/should be const.\n- metal_mutex_acquire / metal_condition_wait / metal_condition_signal / metal_mutex_release: the function prototypes (parameter types and const qualifiers) are required to determine whether these APIs accept const-qualified pointers or require mutable pointers; this shows whether passing &lock or &nfull_condv would violate the \u2018\u2018pointer should be const when possible\u2019\u2019 rule or whether a non-const parameter is mandated by the API.\n- metal_mutex_t (or the actual struct type of lock): the concrete type definition is necessary to judge whether its address could/should be a pointer-to-const in this context.\n- metal_condition_t / metal_cond_t (or the actual struct type of condition variables): same reason as above for the condition variables.\n- thread start routine prototype (e.g. pthread_create / void *(*start_routine)(void *)): producer_thread has signature void *producer_thread(void *). To decide if the (void *arg) parameter should be const-qualified, we must know whether the thread creation/start API requires the non-const void * signature (which would prevent changing it to const) or whether the signature is under our control.\n\nCollecting these symbols (types and prototypes) lets an analyst determine whether pointers taken/passed in producer_thread could/should be const-qualified and whether changing signatures would be compatible with the required APIs (i.e. whether a const qualification is possible or would violate required callback prototypes)."
