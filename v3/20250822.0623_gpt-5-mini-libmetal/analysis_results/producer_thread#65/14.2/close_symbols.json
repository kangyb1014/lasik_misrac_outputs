The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect the implementations/signatures of each listed symbol because MISRA\u2019s for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness must be checked not only in producer_thread but also in any functions called from it (the rule states the behaviour of the for loop body includes called functions). Explanations:\n- metal_mutex_acquire: inspect its definition to see if it contains any for loops and whether those loops modify loop counters or objects that producer_thread modifies (e.g. counter) or have persistent side effects.\n- metal_condition_wait: called directly from producer_thread; its body may contain for loops or release/reacquire logic (it already calls other mutex helpers). You must check its for loops for correct counter usage and side effects.\n- metal_condition_signal: inspect for any internal for loops that could violate the rule or modify objects used by producer_thread.\n- metal_mutex_release: inspect for loops in its implementation and whether they modify shared objects or loop counters used elsewhere.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: transitive callee of metal_condition_wait; include to examine any for loops it contains and ensure they obey the rule.\n- counter: global object incremented in producer_thread; must be checked to see if any for loops in called functions use or modify this object (rule prohibits using objects modified in the loop body in the for second/third clauses).\n- COUNTER_MAX: constant/macro used in the while condition; include to see if any for loops compare against it or otherwise use it in ways relevant to the rule.\n- lock: the mutex object passed to mutex functions; its type/behavior may be involved in called functions' loops and side effects\u2014need its definition to see if loops modify other objects or counters.\n- nfull_condv, nempty_condv: condition variables passed to condition APIs; their implementations may contain for loops or side effects that must be inspected for MISRA compliance.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any for loop reachable from producer_thread violates the MISRA for\u2011loop clauses, you must examine the full definitions of the listed functions and the definitions/uses of the named globals/objects they manipulate."
