  "explanation": "To determine whether producer_thread participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the implementations of every function it calls and the functions those call. Specifically:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: called directly by producer_thread; its body (and any callees) must be checked to ensure it does not call producer_thread (directly or via further calls).\n- metal_condition_wait: called directly by producer_thread; it itself calls other mutex helpers, so its implementation must be inspected for any call paths back to producer_thread.\n- metal_condition_signal: called directly by producer_thread; examine its body to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call producer_thread.\n- metal_mutex_release: called directly by producer_thread and by metal_condition_wait; inspect it to ensure it does not call producer_thread.\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: called by metal_condition_wait; included because it is a callee of a callee and therefore part of any possible indirect call chain that could reach producer_thread.\n\nInspecting these symbols (and any further callees found within them) is sufficient to discover any call path from producer_thread back to itself, which is required to decide compliance with the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls."
