  "explanation": "counter \u2014 need the declaration (type, storage duration, and whether volatile/atomic) and all modification sites to determine if the controlling expression (counter == COUNTER_MAX) can change while the loop executes.\n\nCOUNTER_MAX \u2014 need the definition (macro or constant) to know whether the comparison is against a compile-time invariant constant and whether the expression can ever be false given counter's type/range.\n\nmetal_condition_wait \u2014 crucial to know its semantics (does it atomically release the mutex and block, can it return spuriously, does it re-acquire the mutex on return). These semantics determine whether other threads may modify counter while the loop is waiting and whether the loop\u2019s controlling expression is non\u2011invariant.\n\nmetal_mutex_acquire \u2014 need to confirm locking semantics (does it actually acquire the mutex, implications for mutual exclusion) so we can reason about when counter can be changed by other threads relative to the loop.\n\nmetal_mutex_release \u2014 similarly required to understand when the lock is released (including whether metal_condition_wait internally releases/re-acquires it) so we can determine if counter can be modified by others during the loop.\n\nmetal_condition_signal \u2014 need its semantics (which waiters it wakes, whether it causes the waiting thread to re-check the condition) to reason whether the waiting loop can terminate because another thread signals.\n\nconsumer_thread \u2014 include the consumer (and any other threads that modify counter) to inspect whether they decrement/modify counter and when they signal the condition variables; this shows whether counter can change while producer_thread is blocked and thus whether the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\nnfull_condv and nempty_condv \u2014 the condition variable objects used by wait/signal; their identities and usage sites are needed to match which threads signal which waiters and to reason about which condition changes drive progress of the loop.\n\n(These symbols together let an analyst determine whether counter==COUNTER_MAX can change during the while loop \u2014 either by the producer itself, by other threads while the mutex is released by condition wait, or via spurious/other wakeups \u2014 and therefore whether the controlling expression is truly invariant.)"
