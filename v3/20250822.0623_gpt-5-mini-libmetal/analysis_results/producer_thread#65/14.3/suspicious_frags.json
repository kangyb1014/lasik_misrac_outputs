  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 because they do not contain controlling expressions that are compile-time or run-time invariant. In particular:\n- The variable counter is a shared, mutable object (modified by consumer_thread) and is accessed under the protection of the mutex; it is not a compile-time constant. Access is synchronized, so the controlling expressions depend on a non-invariant runtime value. \n- The condition-variable wait implementation releases the mutex and re-acquires it, allowing other threads to modify counter while the thread is blocked; the loop forms are the correct pattern to handle spurious wake-ups. \n- The constants and initializers (e.g. COUNTER_MAX, METAL_CONDITION_INIT) are used only in comparisons with mutable state; they do not by themselves create invariant controlling expressions. \n- Other statements such as (void)arg;, metal_mutex_acquire/release, metal_condition_signal, and return NULL are not controlling expressions and are outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\nGiven the above, only the loop controlling expressions shown should be investigated further to confirm they are not invariant in the observed execution context."
