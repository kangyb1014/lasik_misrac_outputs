  "explanation": "Only loop controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The listed for-loop is the only loop in the function and so is reported for investigation. Other fragments do not contain controlling expressions and therefore need not be investigated for this rule: the (void)bus; (void)device; (void)dir; casts are not controlling expressions, the function signature and variable declarations are not controlling expressions, and the call metal_cache_invalidate(...) is a statement inside the loop body rather than a loop control expression. No while or do-while loops or other obvious invariant controlling expressions appear in the function."
