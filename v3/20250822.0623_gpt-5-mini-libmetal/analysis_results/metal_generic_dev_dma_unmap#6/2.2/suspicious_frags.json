  "explanation": "I flagged the explicit void-cast statements as suspicious because they are statements that have no effect on program behaviour and therefore are candidates for dead code inspection under Rule 2.2. Other code fragments were not selected because they perform observable actions or affect program behaviour: the for-loop and its call to metal_cache_invalidate() in metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap clearly perform cache operations on provided scatter-gather entries; in metal_generic_dev_dma_map the conditional memcpy() copies data when needed, the conditional metal_cache_flush() affects cache state when dir indicates a device write, the subsequent metal_cache_invalidate() affects cache state, and the function returns a meaningful value (nents_in). These operations have side effects or influence program output/timing and therefore are not considered dead code and do not require investigation under Rule 2.2."
