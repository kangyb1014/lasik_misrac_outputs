  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related struct snippets for use of compiler-specific or nonstandard language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __attribute__((...)), __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_ names, __extension__, anonymous/unnamed fields that rely on extensions, asm labels, or other vendor-specific keywords). None of these constructs appear in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: parameter casts to (void) to suppress unused warnings, a simple for loop, indexing of an array of struct metal_sg, a call to metal_cache_invalidate, and use of standard fixed-width integer type uint32_t. The additional struct excerpts contain only ordinary member declarations and a macro-sized array; the \"...\" markers indicate omitted code, not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that should be investigated for Rule 1.2 in the supplied snippets."
