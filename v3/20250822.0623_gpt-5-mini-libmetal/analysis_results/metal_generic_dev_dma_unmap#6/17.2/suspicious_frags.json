  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion: the (void) casts for bus, device, and dir only suppress unused-parameter warnings; the declaration \"int i;\" and the for-loop control \"for (i = 0; i < nents; i++) { ... }\" are simple control/variable operations; and the reference to sg[i].virt and sg[i].len are field accesses, not function calls. No other function calls or function-pointer invocations appear in this fragment, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
