  "explanation": "I selected the entire function definition as the suspicious fragment so investigators can check for potential unreachable-code issues at both the function level (e.g. the function might never be called in the project) and inside the function (e.g. loop body not entered for all valid inputs). There are no other code fragments in the provided snippet outside this function to inspect separately, so no additional fragments were omitted."
