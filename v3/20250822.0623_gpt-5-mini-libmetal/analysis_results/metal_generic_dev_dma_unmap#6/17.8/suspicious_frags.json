  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Details:\n- bus, device, dir: each only appear as (void)bus; (void)device; (void)dir; these casts are used to silence unused-parameter warnings and do not modify the parameter objects.\n- sg: used only for indexed access (sg[i].virt, sg[i].len) and passed to metal_cache_invalidate. Indexing accesses the objects pointed to by sg but does not assign to or change the value of the pointer parameter sg itself; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8.\n- nents: only used as a read-only loop bound; it is not assigned to or modified.\n- No assignments, increments, or other operations that change the value of any parameter (e.g., sg = ..., bus = ..., dir++, etc.) are present.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
