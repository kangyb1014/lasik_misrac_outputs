  "explanation": "No other fragments modify function parameters. Declarations (struct metal_list *node, struct metal_bus *bus) are local variables. The metal_list_for_each macro only updates the local loop variable node. The metal_container_of macro computes a pointer from node and does not modify any function parameters. The call to strcmp(bus->name, name) uses the pointer parameter name but does not modify it (and name is const-qualified). There is no assignment to the parameter variables name or result themselves elsewhere in the function; only the object pointed to by result is assigned, which is why the if-block above is the only fragment needing investigation under Rule 17.8."
