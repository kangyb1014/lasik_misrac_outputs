  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call strcmp(bus->name, name) is evaluated before checking result. If name is NULL (or if bus->name is not a valid NUL-terminated buffer or points to a shorter buffer), strcmp will read via an invalid pointer or past the object bounds, causing out-of-bounds/undefined access. For example, a caller passing name == NULL will make strcmp dereference a NULL pointer. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified metal_bus_find code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/29.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_bus_find as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_bus_find:\n```c\nint metal_bus_find(const char *name, struct metal_bus **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.bus_list, node) {\n\t\tbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n\t\t\t*result = bus;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified metal_bus_find code.\n",
