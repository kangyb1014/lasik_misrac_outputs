  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_bus_find:\n```c\nint metal_bus_find(const char *name, struct metal_bus **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.bus_list, node) {\n\t\tbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n\t\t\t*result = bus;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_bus_find:\n#define metal_list_for_each(list, node) for((node)=(list)->next;(node)!=(list);(node)=(node)->next)\n...\n#define metal_container_of(ptr, structure, member) (void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment 'bus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);' is inside the for-loop body and only reads the loop counter (node) to compute the containing object; it does not modify the loop counter or any other object that is modified in the loop body. The for macro expands to: for((node)=(list)->next; (node)!=(list); (node)=(node)->next) \u2014 there is a single loop counter (node), initialized in the first clause, tested without side-effects in the second clause, and modified only in the third clause. The metal_container_of macro performs pointer arithmetic without side-effects. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated."
