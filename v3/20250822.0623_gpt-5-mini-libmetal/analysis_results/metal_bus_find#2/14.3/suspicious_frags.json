  "explanation": "Only the controlling expressions in the function are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other fragments in the function are declarations, assignments or a return statement and do not contain controlling expressions that could be invariant. For example: the declarations \"struct metal_list *node;\" and \"struct metal_bus *bus;\", the assignment \"bus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\", and the final \"return -ENOENT;\" are not controlling expressions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
