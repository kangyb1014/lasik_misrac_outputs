  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the single fragment. The line is a macro invocation (metal_container_of(...)) and, as written, uses only standard-looking casts/pointer arithmetic. Whether a compiler extension is used depends on the macro definition. If metal_container_of is implemented using only offsetof/casts it does not violate Rule 1.2. If it uses GCC extensions (e.g. typeof, ({ ... }) statement expressions) then it would violate Rule 1.2. Inspect the definition of metal_container_of to decide; based on the fragment alone, report no violation."
