  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified you must be able to show that no assignment or side-effect in the function changes the parameter variables ldev or ldrv themselves (reassignment). Each listed symbol is required to disambiguate whether accesses in the function modify the parameter variable or only the objects they point to:\n\n- struct linux_device: required to confirm which members exist (sdev, dev_name, override) and to verify that the assignment ldev->override = attr modifies the object pointed to by ldev (allowed) rather than modifying the ldev parameter variable itself.\n\n- struct linux_driver: required to confirm members (drv_name, sdrv) and to ensure access ldrv->... does not rebind the ldrv parameter.\n\n- type of linux_device->sdev (e.g. struct sysfs_device): required to check that accesses like ldev->sdev->driver_name are field accesses into a pointed-to object (allowed) and to ensure sdev is not a macro or a pointer-to-pointer that could cause ldev itself to be modified.\n\n- type of linux_driver->sdrv (driver sysfs object): same reason for ldrv->sdrv and subsequent calls; ensures those are field accesses into pointed objects, not something that could reassign ldrv.\n\n- struct sysfs_attribute: needed to confirm attr is a regular pointer variable and that assigning ldev->override = attr is a field store into the pointed device object, not a macro that changes the parameter.\n\n- sysfs_get_device_attr prototype: required to ensure this function does not take a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise perform operations that could result in modification of the ldev local parameter variable (e.g. via macros or unusual prototypes). The prototype shows it takes the sdev object pointer by value and returns an attribute pointer (no reassignment of ldev).\n\n- sysfs_get_driver_attr prototype: same reason as above for calls using ldrv->sdrv.\n\n- sysfs_write_attribute prototype: included to ensure writes and its return-value handling do not involve passing ldev or ldrv by reference in a way that could modify the parameter variables.\n\n- SYSFS_UNKNOWN macro/constant: needed to confirm its type (string literal) so the strcmp usage is a normal read-only comparison and not a macro that could have side effects on parameters.\n\n- errno declaration: required because the function returns -errno on some failures; include to ensure there are no weird errno macros that could expand into expressions that modify function parameters.\n\nTogether these symbols allow a reviewer to prove that only the objects pointed to by the parameters are modified (which MISRA permits) and that the parameter variables ldev and ldrv themselves are not reassigned or altered inside metal_uio_dev_bind."
