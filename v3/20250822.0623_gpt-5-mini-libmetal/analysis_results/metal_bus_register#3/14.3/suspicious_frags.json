  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions present. The two conditional expressions are runtime-dependent: (1) if (!bus || !bus->name || !strlen(bus->name)) relies on the pointer values and the runtime string length; (2) if (metal_bus_find(bus->name, NULL) == 0) depends on the result of a lookup function. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other selection constructs with constant/invariant controlling expressions. The remaining statements (metal_list_init, metal_list_add_tail, metal_log, return) are not controlling expressions and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3."
