  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I inspected the provided code (metal_bus_register and the related metal_bus_find). There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in these fragments. The only string comparisons use strcmp (in metal_bus_find) and strlen (in metal_bus_register) \u2014 neither is memcmp \u2014 so they are not relevant to Rule 21.14. No other functions in the supplied code call memcmp directly, and the list/container helpers shown do not involve string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14. If you want a broader review, provide additional source files to check for any memcmp usage."
