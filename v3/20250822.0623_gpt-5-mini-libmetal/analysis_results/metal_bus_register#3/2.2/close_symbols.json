  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to judge dead code in metal_bus_register:\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition: fields 'name', 'devices', 'node')\n  - The function reads bus->name and manipulates bus->devices and bus->node. To decide if those operations are observable (i.e. not removable), the concrete layout and semantics of these fields are required.\n\n- metal_bus_find (implementation and semantics)\n  - The call to metal_bus_find controls an early-return branch (duplicate bus check). Whether that branch ever triggers and whether metal_bus_find has side-effects (reads/writes globals) affects if the call and the branch are meaningful or dead.\n\n- metal_list_init (implementation)\n  - Called to initialize bus->devices. If the init is a no-op or only affects local/non-observable state, it could be dead; if it sets up global/visible state or must be called to avoid later faults, it is not dead. Implementation determines observability.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (implementation)\n  - This mutates a list (passing &_metal.common.bus_list and &bus->node). To decide whether this mutation is observable (and thus not dead), we must know exactly what add_tail changes (global list, locking, side-effects) and whether those changes are used elsewhere.\n\n- _metal (global object and type of common.bus_list)\n  - The global bus list being modified by add_tail must be inspected: where else is it read/used (e.g. lookups, iteration)? If nobody ever reads it or it is shadowed/unused, the add_tail could be dead; otherwise it is observable.\n\n- metal_log (implementation) and METAL_LOG_DEBUG / logging configuration macros\n  - The function logs a debug message. Logging can be compiled out or be the only observable side-effect of the call; knowing whether metal_log produces observable behaviour (I/O, side-effects) or is a no-op in typical builds is necessary to determine whether the call (and the message) is dead.\n\n- strlen (libc behaviour)\n  - The code uses strlen(bus->name) in a condition. Although strlen is normally pure, confirming it has no side-effects and that the condition is meaningful (vs. redundant given bus->name checks) is needed to judge whether the strlen call and corresponding branch are dead.\n\n- metal_linux_register_bus and its callers / reachability information\n  - To decide if metal_bus_register itself (and its body) is dead code at project level, you must know whether it is ever reachable/called in the build configuration. Inspecting its callers (and further caller graph / linkage) is required to determine reachability.\n\nIn short: you need the data structure definitions, the implementations of the three callee functions and logging, the global bus-list symbol and who reads it, the behaviour of strlen, and caller/reachability information. Those symbols determine whether the operations inside metal_bus_register have externally observable effects (and therefore are not dead) or can be removed without affecting program behaviour."
