  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The snippet uses only standard C language constructs (if, ternary operator, variable declarations, return) and POSIX/library APIs/macros (open, shm_open, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, strlen, errno/EINVAL). None of these are compiler-specific language extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, __extension__, or other documented compiler extensions. The use of -errno and error macros is a convention but not a language extension. The pointer null check combined with strlen relies on short-circuit evaluation, which is standard C. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
