  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Every statement can be executed depending on inputs: the early return (return -EINVAL) is taken only when path is NULL or empty; otherwise the fd assignment using either shm_open or open is reachable, and the final return (ternary) is reachable in both outcomes (fd < 0 and fd >= 0). The constant initializers (flags, mode) are used. The use of strlen(path) is safe because the left operand of the || operator checks for NULL and short-circuits, so there is no undefined behaviour leading to unreachable code. There are no unconditional jumps, infinite loops, or code following an unconditional return that would be unreachable. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
