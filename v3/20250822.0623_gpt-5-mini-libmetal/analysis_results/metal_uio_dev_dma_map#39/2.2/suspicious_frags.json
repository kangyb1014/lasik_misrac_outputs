  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains operations that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the input-checking loops (for i and inner for j), the pointer arithmetic and range checks (vaddr_sg_lo/vaddr_sg_hi vs vaddr_lo/vaddr_hi), the error path that logs and returns -EINVAL, the conditional memcpy that copies scatter-gather entries when sg_out != sg_in, and the final return of nents_in. Removing any of those would change control flow, data flow, or observable behaviour (including error reporting), so they do not meet the definition of dead code. There is no unreachable code in the shown fragment, and declarations/initializations present are either required by subsequent operations or are language-level declarations (not removable without effect)."
