True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe statement '(void)lbus;' is an expression statement that only evaluates and discards the parameter value. It has no effect on program behaviour in this context (lbus is a normal parameter, not volatile and no side effects from evaluating it), so removing the statement would not change program behaviour. Therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If lbus were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, the statement would not be dead, but that is not the case here.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's narrow technical observation is correct in one sense: the expression statement '(void)lbus;' is a no\u2011op with no side effects, and removing it does not change the runtime behaviour of the function. Taken literally from the wording of Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), that single statement meets the literal definition of dead code.\n\nHowever, in practice and in common MISRA usage this construct is a conventional, intentional way to document and suppress an \"unused parameter\" warning. MISRA guidance and common compliance practice accept the explicit void\u2011cast of an unused parameter as a clear, intentional annotation (or else require a documented deviation). In other words, although the statement is a no\u2011op, it is not an accidental/meaningless leftover; it is an intentional marker. Therefore reporting this line as a plain Rule 2.2 violation is not appropriate without further context (for example, whether the project policy forbids such unused\u2011parameter annotations and requires parameters to be removed or an alternative mechanism used).\n\nRecommendation: If the parameter truly is unused, prefer one of these approaches for clarity and compliance: remove the parameter (and adjust callers if possible), omit the parameter name in the prototype/definition, use a project\u2011approved UNUSED macro or compiler attribute, or document an explicit deviation if the void cast is kept. If your project policy disallows any no\u2011ops, then flagging it under Rule 2.2 could be justified; otherwise the agent's report that this is a violation is not correct in the usual MISRA compliance context."
