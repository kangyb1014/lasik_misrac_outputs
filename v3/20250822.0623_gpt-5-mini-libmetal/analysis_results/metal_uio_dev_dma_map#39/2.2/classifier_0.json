The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nstatic int metal_uio_dev_dma_map(struct linux_bus *lbus,\n\t\t\t\t struct linux_device *ldev,\n\t\t\t\t uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t\t int nents_in,\n\t\t\t\t struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i, j;\n\tvoid *vaddr_sg_lo, *vaddr_sg_hi, *vaddr_lo, *vaddr_hi;\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io;\n\n\t(void)lbus;\n\t(void)dir;\n\n\t/* Check if the the input virt address is MMIO address */\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tvaddr_sg_lo = sg_in[i].virt;\n\t\tvaddr_sg_hi = vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len;\n\t\tfor (j = 0, io = ldev->device.regions;\n\t\t     j < (int)ldev->device.num_regions; j++, io++) {\n\t\t\tvaddr_lo = io->virt;\n\t\t\tvaddr_hi = vaddr_lo + io->size;\n\t\t\tif (vaddr_sg_lo >= vaddr_lo &&\n\t\t\t    vaddr_sg_hi <= vaddr_hi) {\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (j == (int)ldev->device.num_regions) {\n\t\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_WARNING,\n\t\t\t  \"%s,%s: input address isn't MMIO addr: 0x%x,%d.\\n\",\n\t\t\t__func__, ldev->dev_name, vaddr_sg_lo, sg_in[i].len);\n\t\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void)lbus;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The statement '(void)lbus;' is an expression statement that only evaluates and discards the parameter value. It has no effect on program behaviour in this context (lbus is a normal parameter, not volatile and no side effects from evaluating it), so removing the statement would not change program behaviour. Therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If lbus were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, the statement would not be dead, but that is not the case here.)"
