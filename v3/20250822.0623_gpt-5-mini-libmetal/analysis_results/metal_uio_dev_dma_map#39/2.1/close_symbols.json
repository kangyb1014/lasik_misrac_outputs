  "explanation": "For MISRA unreachable-code analysis you must know any definitions or behaviours that can change control-flow or make code paths impossible. Each symbol below is needed and why:\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - Required to know how ldev->device.num_regions and ldev->device.regions are typed and laid out, and the type of ldev->dev_name. That affects the loop bounds, pointer comparisons and whether the inner loop can ever iterate/break (e.g. num_regions == 0 makes the break impossible and forces the return path).\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - Included because it is a parameter (lbus) even though unused here; its definition can reveal attributes or macros (e.g. annotations) that might alter compilation/flow or be aliased to other semantics. Having it available rules out hidden effects that could make code unreachable.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Defines io->virt and io->size types. The pointer/size types determine the validity of the pointer arithmetic and comparisons (vaddr_sg_lo >= vaddr_lo && vaddr_sg_hi <= vaddr_hi) and therefore whether the inner loop\u2019s break condition can ever succeed.\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - Defines sg_in[].virt and sg_in[].len types. These determine the values used in comparisons and the computed vaddr_sg_hi; knowing these types is necessary to evaluate whether the loop conditions are satisfiable or always false/true (which would make code paths unreachable).\n\n- metal_log\n  - The logging facility may be a function, macro or even a noreturn wrapper. If metal_log (or its underlying implementation) does not return (e.g. aborts, exits, longjmp, or marked noreturn), that would make subsequent code unreachable. You must see its definition/attributes to determine reachability after its invocation.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The logging level macro/value may expand to something that alters the metal_log call (e.g. a compile-time nop or to a different routine). Knowing its definition is necessary to understand the effect of the metal_log invocation on control flow.\n\n- memcpy\n  - memcpy could be a normal function, an inline intrinsic, or a macro that expands differently in this project. If it were replaced by something that does not return or otherwise changes control flow, that affects reachability of later code. Knowing its declaration/definition ensures the final return path is reachable.\n\n- EINVAL\n  - The macro returned on error. While its numeric value does not change control flow, its definition could be overridden or redefined to something atypical in this codebase; include it to rule out unexpected behaviour that might affect reachability analysis.\n\nHaving these definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether any branch or statement in metal_uio_dev_dma_map is provably never executed (unreachable) due to types, constants, or called-symbol behaviour."
