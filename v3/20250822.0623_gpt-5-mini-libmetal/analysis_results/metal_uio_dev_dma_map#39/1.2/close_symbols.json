  "explanation": "- struct metal_sg: the code does pointer arithmetic vaddr_sg_hi = vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len; whether this is a language extension depends on the declared type of virt (void * vs char */uint8_t *). You must know the exact member types (virt, len) to decide if void* arithmetic is used.  \n- struct metal_io_region: similarly vaddr_lo = io->virt; vaddr_hi = vaddr_lo + io->size; the declared types of virt and size determine whether pointer+integer uses standard pointer arithmetic or a compiler extension (void* arithmetic).  \n- struct linux_device: the function reads ldev->device and ldev->dev_name; you need the struct layout and types to see how device.regions and num_regions are declared (pointer types, integer types) and whether any nonstandard types/macros are involved.  \n- type/definition of ldev->device (the embedded device struct): explicitly need the types of regions and num_regions (e.g. regions pointer element type) to tell whether regions points to metal_io_region and whether num_regions is an integer type; these affect the comparisons and pointer arithmetic semantics.  \n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_WARNING: metal_log could be a function-like macro, variadic macro, or use compiler attributes/extensions; its definition/prototype is required to see if any language extensions (variadic macros, GCC attributes, statement-expressions, etc.) are used when invoking the logger.  \n- memcpy prototype: to confirm standard library usage and to check for any nonstandard replacement macro; also to ensure no compiler-specific builtin is required.  \n- EINVAL macro: needed to know that it is a standard errno macro and not a project-defined extension.  \n- __func__: this identifier is a C99 standard builtin in many compilers; include its status for the target compiler/standard to determine if its use relies on an extension.  \n- uint32_t typedef / stdint.h: confirm the integer typedefs used (uint32_t) are standard types and not compiler-specific extensions.  \n- Translation-unit includes / project headers: to get authoritative declarations of the above structs/macros (the real definitions may be in project headers which could themselves use extensions).  \n- Compiler documentation for pointer-arithmetic on void *: ultimately whether expressions like void_ptr + integer are a language extension depends on the compiler (GCC treats void* arithmetic as an extension). You need the target compiler documentation/standard mode to decide if the code uses a forbidden language extension.\n\nThese symbols (and the compiler doc) are the minimal items required to determine if the apparent use of void* + integer or any macros/function calls in this function rely on compiler-specific language extensions."
