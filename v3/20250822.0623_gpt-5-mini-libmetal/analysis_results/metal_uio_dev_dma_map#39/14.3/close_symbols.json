  "explanation": "For checking whether any controlling expression in metal_uio_dev_dma_map is invariant (MISRA rule), the analyser must know the definitions, types and potential side-effects of all symbols that appear in loop/if conditions or that could make those conditions vary implicitly:\n\n- struct linux_device: needed to inspect the layout of the device member and to locate num_regions and regions declarations (are they fields, macros, functions, or volatile?).\n- struct linux_device::device (type and members): the concrete type of the device member may define num_regions as a computed property or volatile field; this affects whether j < num_regions can be considered invariant.\n- ldev->device.num_regions: the controlling expression of the inner loop uses this value. The analyser must know its type (signed/unsigned), whether it is a constant, or declared volatile, or if reading it can have side effects.\n- ldev->device.regions: inner loop initializes io from this pointer; the definition determines whether io advances across elements and whether regions can alias or change during the loop.\n- ldev->dev_name: used in the logging call; not a controlling expression itself but required to understand logging side-effects and to fully resolve the ldev structure.\n\n- struct metal_sg: definition needed to know types of fields used in control-flow expressions (virt and len) \u2014 e.g., whether virt is a pointer type or integer type and whether len is signed/unsigned/volatile.\n- sg_in[].virt: vaddr_sg_lo is computed from this; its type and semantics determine whether pointer arithmetic/comparisons in the conditions are well-defined or compiler-specific (and whether the value can change during the loop via aliasing).\n- sg_in[].len: used to compute vaddr_sg_hi; its type affects pointer arithmetic and whether it can change during loop iterations.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: required to know types of virt and size members and whether they are volatile or computed, which affects vaddr_lo/vaddr_hi and whether the comparisons can vary across iterations.\n- io->virt and io->size: used to compute vaddr_lo and vaddr_hi in the inner loop; the analyser needs their types and mutability to judge whether the inner loop controlling expression changes as io advances.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_WARNING: the diagnostic call executed on failure; include to determine whether logging has side effects that could alter loop control variables or program state relevant to invariance analysis (typically not, but must be known).\n- __func__: included because it appears in the log call (no control effect, but resolves the logging call arguments).\n- memcpy: used after the loops; while not part of the loop conditions, its presence could introduce aliasing concerns (if sg_out == sg_in is tested) that might affect static reasoning about whether inputs change elsewhere.\n- EINVAL: returned on error \u2014 include to fully resolve control-flow consequences of the log/return branch.\n\nIn short: to decide if the for/if controlling expressions are invariant you must know the exact types, mutability/volatility and potential side-effects of the device/region/sg fields and any functions called. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to make that determination."
