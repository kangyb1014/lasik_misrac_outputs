The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' you must know which objects are used/modified in the for headers and whether any called functions or object definitions introduce side-effects or additional loop counters. The required symbols and why:\n\n1) struct metal_sg\n   - Fields used: virt and len (sg_in[i].virt, sg_in[i].len)\n   - Reason: The outer for uses sg_in[i] in its body. To verify the outer loop is well-formed you must ensure accesses to sg_in[i] do not have persistent side effects (e.g. volatile accessors or overloaded operators in non\u2011C code), and that sg_in[i].len is not an object that could be modified by the loop body or called functions. The exact field types (and whether they are volatile) affect whether their use in the loop body/headers violates MISRA.\n\n2) struct metal_io_region\n   - Fields used: virt and size (io->virt, io->size)\n   - Reason: The inner for initializes io = ldev->device.regions and increments io++ in the third clause. To decide if the inner for modifies only the loop counter (MISRA requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter), you must know the type of io and io->... fields and whether io is a plain local pointer or has special semantics (volatile, overloaded, etc.). Also need to confirm io++ is merely changing a local pointer and not having side effects.\n\n3) struct linux_device (specifically device.regions, device.num_regions, dev_name)\n   - Fields used: device.regions (initial value for io), device.num_regions (used in inner loop condition), dev_name (used in error logging)\n   - Reason: The inner loop condition uses ldev->device.num_regions. MISRA requires the second clause to have no persistent side effects and to use only the loop counter and optional loop control flags; you must confirm num_regions is a simple object (not a macro/function, not volatile, and not modified by loop body or by any called function). The definition of device.regions is needed to determine the exact type assigned to io. dev_name is only used in logging but its type/representation can confirm logging does not alter loop-control objects.\n\n4) metal_log (function)\n   - Reason: The outer loop body calls metal_log on detected error paths. MISRA treats the behaviour of functions called inside the loop as part of the loop body. To conclude that i and j (the loop counters) and any objects used in the for clauses (e.g. ldev->device.num_regions) are not modified by called functions, you must inspect metal_log to ensure it has no side effects that modify those objects (or any global state that can be observed as modifying loop-control objects). If metal_log can modify num_regions or the counters, the loops may violate the rule.\n\nNotes/assumptions not requiring separate symbols here but relevant to the analysis:\n- The local loop counters i and j and pointer io are declared in the function; their types (int, struct metal_io_region *) are visible in the target function and should be considered. The key concern is whether other symbols (the structs and functions above) introduce side effects. memcpy and the EINVAL symbolic constant are not called/used inside the loop bodies in a way that affects loop well-formedness (memcpy is called after the loops), so their definitions are not required for this MISRA check."
