  "explanation": "To decide whether any formal parameter is being modified you must inspect the types/fields accessed in the function and the called functions/macros that could have side effects. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- struct linux_device: The code dereferences ldev (ldev->device and ldev->dev_name). You need the struct definition to verify that accessing these members is not invoking any macro-like side effect or assignment to the ldev parameter itself.\n\n- struct linux_device.device (fields: regions, num_regions): The nested device field is used to get regions and num_regions; you must know their types (pointer vs accessor) to ensure the code does not perform an implicit modification of ldev or the device field.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The loop uses io->virt and io->size. The layout and types determine whether io/virt accesses could be macros or inline functions that modify any parameter.\n\n- struct metal_sg: sg_in and sg_out are pointers to this type; you need the struct definition (virt, len) to check whether operations on sg_in[i] or the memcpy size expression could hide modifications of the sg_in/sg_out pointer variables (e.g., via overloaded macros or unusual semantics).\n\n- metal_log: This function (or macro) is called with ldev->dev_name and vaddr_sg_lo. If metal_log is a macro or a function with side effects it could modify parameters or objects reachable from parameter pointers; inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to any of the function parameters.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: This logging token may be a macro that expands to code with side effects; its definition must be checked for any modifications to parameters.\n\n- memcpy: Called to copy data through sg_out. You need the prototype/definition to confirm it does not modify the pointer parameter variables themselves (only the objects they point to). Also confirm memcpy is the standard implementation and not a macro with unexpected side effects.\n\n- uint32_t: The type of dir; include its definition to confirm dir is a simple integer type (so casts/uses cannot hide modifications) and that (void)dir is not a macro that modifies it.\n\n- __func__: The function-name identifier is used in the logging call; include to confirm it is a compile-time string and not redefined as a macro with side effects.\n\n- EINVAL: The returned negative constant\u2014include to ensure return expression is not a macro that could involve side effects affecting parameters.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyzer check (1) whether any parameter variable (the pointer variables lbus, ldev, dir, sg_in, nents_in, sg_out) is assigned to inside the function or indirectly via macros, and (2) whether called functions/macros perform hidden assignments to those parameters. Only with the definitions of the listed types/macros/functions can you conclude compliance with the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified."
