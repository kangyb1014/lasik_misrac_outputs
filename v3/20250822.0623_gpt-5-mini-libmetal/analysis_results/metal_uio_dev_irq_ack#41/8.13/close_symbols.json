  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - The function takes a parameter 'struct linux_bus *lbus' and does not use it. To decide whether this pointer should be declared as 'const struct linux_bus *' we must know the structure definition to ensure there are no implicit or intended modifications of the pointed object elsewhere or hidden mutable members. The struct definition lets the analyzer determine if making the pointer const is permissible.\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - The function takes 'struct linux_device *ldev' and reads ldev->fd but does not modify ldev. To decide if the parameter should be 'const struct linux_device *ldev' (or whether fields or pointer types inside the struct preclude const), the analyzer needs the complete struct definition (field types, any pointers inside, volatile or const annotations). This shows whether the function legitimately can/should take a const pointer.\n\n- ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)\n  - The second parameter of read is a non-const void*. The analyzer must know this prototype to determine that the buffer passed to read is written by the call (so the pointer must not be const). This impacts whether 'val' and its address require const qualification and whether any pointer casts are safe/necessary.\n\n- ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)\n  - The second parameter of write is a const void*. Knowing this prototype shows that passing &irq_info (a non-const int *) to write is allowed (non-const -> const conversion) and whether irq_info could/should be declared const. This affects whether a pointer argument could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- errno (extern int errno)\n  - errno is referenced in the error log. Knowing its declaration/type rules out any pointer-related constness issues for values passed to metal_log and ensures correct interpretation of that argument (it is an int, not a pointer requiring const qualification).\n\n- void metal_log(int level, const char *fmt, ...)\n  - The log function is called with format strings and __func__; knowing metal_log's prototype (particularly the constness of format-string parameter) is necessary to determine whether any pointer arguments to metal_log should be const-qualified.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro value)\n  - The logging level macro is a non-pointer symbol used in calls to metal_log; including it ensures the analyzer has the complete signature/context for the log calls. While not directly a pointer, it completes the prototype/context for metal_log usage.\n\nNotes:\n- The prototypes for read/write (and errno) are normally provided by unistd.h/errno.h; metal_log and the structs are likely project headers. These symbols allow the next agent to decide where const qualifiers could be added (function parameters, local buffers, etc.) without violating the intended semantics (for example, read's buffer must be non-const because it is written to)."
