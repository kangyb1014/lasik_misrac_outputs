  "explanation": "I did not flag local non-pointer variables (unsigned int val; int irq_info; int ret;) because they are modified in this function (val receives data from read(), irq_info is written and used as the data to acknowledge the IRQ), so they must be non-const. The cast to (void *)&val and the buffer passed to read() must be mutable because read() writes into the buffer. The write() call accepts a const void * argument (so passing &irq_info, a non-const pointer, is allowed and appropriate). The member bus_name is already const-qualified (const char *), so it does not need investigation. The drivers field is an array of structs (not a pointer) and therefore not relevant to rule 8.13. Fields such as the integer fd and the use of errno are not pointer-type issues under this rule. Other code fragments not listed either already use const where appropriate or involve objects that must remain non-const because they are written to."
