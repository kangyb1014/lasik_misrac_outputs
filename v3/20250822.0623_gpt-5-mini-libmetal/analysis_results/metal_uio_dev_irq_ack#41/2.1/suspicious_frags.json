  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function is statically unreachable. Reasoning: 1) There are no unconditional jumps (goto), infinite loops, or statements after an unconditional return that would make following code unreachable. The only return statement is inside the if (ret < 0) branch after read(), which is reachable at runtime when read() fails; the subsequent write() and its error handling are reachable when read() succeeds. 2) The (void)lbus; and (void)irq; lines are explicit unused-parameter suppressions and do not create unreachable code. 3) The metal_log macro expands to a conditional call (using a statement-expression GCC extension) that may compile to an empty/no-op when the logging condition is false, but this does not produce unreachable code in the sense of code that can never be executed \u2014 it only makes the call conditional at runtime. 4) There are no const/compile-time-evaluable conditions (e.g., if (0) or #if 0) or functions that are known to never return used such that subsequent code would be unreachable. Therefore, no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this function."
