  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about pointer const-qualification you must inspect any declarations that introduce pointer types used by the target function. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- metal_log (function prototype): The call metal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"No more available soft irqs\\n\"); likely passes a string argument. You must see the prototype to determine whether the string parameter is declared as const char * or plain char * (MISRA requires const-qualified where possible).\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum/constant): The type of this argument may be an enum or typedef used in the metal_log prototype. Knowing its declaration lets you resolve the exact metal_log signature (see next item).\n\n- any typedefs/enums used in the metal_log prototype (e.g. log-level type): If metal_log uses a typedef or enum for its first parameter, that typedef must be known to fully resolve metal_log's prototype and thus the parameter types (including any pointer parameters).\n\n- metal_softirq_avail (global declaration): Inspect its declaration to confirm its type. If it were a pointer type (or a typedef to a pointer) MISRA const-qualification rules could apply; if it is an integer then it is irrelevant to the pointer rule.\n\n- metal_softirq_num (global declaration): Same rationale as metal_softirq_avail\u2014confirm whether it is a pointer/typedef to pointer or a scalar.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr (global declaration): The code accesses metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base; you must see the declaration of the global to determine the type of metal_softirq_cntr itself (if it is a pointer to a struct, const-qualification may be relevant).\n\n- definition/type of metal_softirq_cntr (struct/typedef): If the struct type contains pointer members or if metal_softirq_cntr is itself declared as a pointer to a struct type, you must examine those member types to determine whether any pointer should be const-qualified.\n\nNote: EINVAL is an integer error macro and does not affect pointer const-qualification; it is not required for this MISRA pointer check."
