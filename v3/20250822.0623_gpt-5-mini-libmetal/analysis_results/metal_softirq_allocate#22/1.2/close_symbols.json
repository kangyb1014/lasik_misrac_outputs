  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of every external symbol and macro used so you can detect use of extensions in their definitions or attributes: \n\n- metal_softirq_avail, metal_softirq_num: need their declarations and types to see if they use extended declarations (e.g. attributes, __thread, unusual storage-class extensions, or non-standard integer types). Type differences (e.g. bitfields, anonymous members) can also indicate extension use.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr and metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base: need the struct/type definition to check for anonymous structs/unions, designated initializers, bitfields, packed/aligned attributes, or other non-standard members or attributes attached to the type or member.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_ERROR: metal_log may be a macro or function; macros can hide compiler extensions (variadic macros, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, asm, __attribute__ decoration). METAL_LOG_ERROR may expand to something that uses extensions. The exact macro/function body or header must be inspected.\n\n- EINVAL: inspect its definition (or the included header) to confirm it is a normal macro/enum constant and that no compiler-specific construct is used to define it in this project.\n\nIn short, any external variable, macro, or type referenced by the function must be examined (their declarations/definitions and the headers that define them) to reliably determine whether the code or its dependencies use language/compiler extensions forbidden by the MISRA rule."
