  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No unreachable-code fragments detected. Reasoning: the function contains a single conditional return whose condition depends on runtime variables (metal_softirq_avail, num, metal_softirq_num), so neither the if-branch nor the fall-through path can be proven impossible at compile time; both are potentially reachable. There are no statements following an unconditional return, no constant boolean conditions, and no dead labels or unreachable blocks. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
