  "explanation": "Only expressions that control flow (if/while/for/do-while/switch) are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. In the provided function, the only explicit controlling expression is the if condition shown above, so it must be investigated to ensure it is not invariant. The assignments to irq_base and the return statements are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. The static variable declaration 'static int metal_softirq_avail' is included because the invariance of the controlling expression could depend on the storage and update of this variable (investigate whether it is truly invariant across calls). The macro invocation METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE is included because its expansion (not shown) could introduce controlling expressions elsewhere; it should be expanded and inspected. No other loops or conditionals are present in the shown code fragment, so there are no additional controlling expressions to investigate."
