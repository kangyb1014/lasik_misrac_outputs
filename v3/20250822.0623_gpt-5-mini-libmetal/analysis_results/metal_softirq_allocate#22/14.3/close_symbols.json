  "explanation": "For MISRA rule 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must determine whether the controlling expression (metal_softirq_avail + num) >= metal_softirq_num can ever be invariant (i.e. compile-time or effectively constant at the point of evaluation). To make that determination the analyzer needs the following symbols and information:\n\n- metal_softirq_avail: This variable appears directly in the controlling expression and is also written in this function. The analysis needs its declaration/definition, type, storage class, const/volatile/atomic qualifiers and initializer to know whether it is a mutable runtime value or an invariant constant/macro. Also needed are knowledge of its linkage (static/extern) so global analyses can find other writers.\n\n- metal_softirq_num: This variable is the other operand of the controlling expression. Its declaration/definition, type, qualifiers and initializer are required to know whether it is a constant (e.g. const, enum, macro) or a mutable runtime value.\n\n- preprocessor definitions / macros for metal_softirq_avail and metal_softirq_num (if any): Either name could be a macro or expand to something else; the preprocessor definition could make the expression invariant. The analyzer must inspect macros.\n\n- all definitions / write-sites that modify metal_softirq_avail or metal_softirq_num (other functions, initialization code): To decide whether the expression can change at runtime the analyzer must know whether these variables are ever modified elsewhere (e.g. other allocate/free functions, initialization). Provide all functions or translation units that write these symbols so the analyzer can determine mutability across the program.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr and metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base: Although not part of the controlling expression, the function reads metal_softirq_cntr.irq_base and updates metal_softirq_avail based on num; understanding the structure and its qualifiers may be needed to reason about interactions or aliasing that could affect metal_softirq_avail (for example if irq_base or the struct is defined via macros or overlays). Include the struct/type definition and its qualifiers.\n\n- declaration/definition of num (parameter type): The parameter's type (signed/unsigned width) affects arithmetic and comparisons and whether the expression could be constant (e.g. if callers always pass a compile-time constant). Include the prototype/signature so the analyzer knows the exact type and range semantics.\n\nWith these symbols (declarations, qualifiers, initializers, and all write-sites) the next agent can determine whether the controlling expression can be constant at runtime or is guaranteed to vary, and therefore whether the MISRA rule is violated or an allowed exception applies."
