  "explanation": "metal_log \u2014 The target function calls metal_log; to determine whether the target function (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect metal_log's implementation and its call chain for any memcmp usage or string comparisons.\n\nMETAL_LOG_ERROR \u2014 The logging level/macro passed to metal_log may expand to a value or string that affects how metal_log behaves; include its definition so the analyzer can see whether a string literal or macro expansion leads to any string comparisons inside the logging implementation.\n\nmemcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The verifier must check for any occurrence of memcmp reachable from the target function (directly or transitively), so include the memcmp symbol (and any wrappers around it) to detect prohibited uses.\n\nmetal_softirq_avail \u2014 Global used by the function. While not directly related to string comparison, include its declaration to confirm the target function does not perform string operations on any globals or cause indirect calls that might use memcmp.\n\nmetal_softirq_num \u2014 Same rationale as metal_softirq_avail: include the global's declaration to rule out indirect string operations tied to its use.\n\nmetal_softirq_cntr \u2014 The struct/global whose irq_base field is read. Include its definition to ensure no hidden string handling occurs via accessor macros or functions.\n\nEINVAL \u2014 The error macro/constant returned by the function; include its definition to ensure there are no surprising macro expansions that introduce string operations.\n\nNote: To complete the MISRA check you must inspect the full implementation (and transitive callees) of metal_log and any functions it calls. If the codebase contains wrappers around memcmp (e.g., str_cmp, plat_memcmp), include those wrapper symbols as well when discovered during that inspection."
