Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for analysing MISRA C \"well-formed for loop\" rule for metal_softirq_allocate:\n\n- metal_softirq_avail\n  - This global is used and modified by the function. To check for MISRA for-loop violations you must know its type and qualifiers (int/unsigned/volatile/atomic) and whether it is used elsewhere as a loop counter or modified inside any called functions. Its declaration/definition reveals whether it could be or is a loop counter or have side effects relevant to for-clause rules.\n\n- metal_softirq_num\n  - This global is read in the conditional. Its type and qualifiers are needed to determine whether the comparison expression has side effects or uses objects that are modified elsewhere (relevant to the second clause requirement). Also to detect implicit conversions that could hide side effects.\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr\n  - The struct/aggregate object containing irq_base is accessed; you need its definition to understand irq_base's type/qualifiers and whether accessing it may have side effects (e.g. via overloaded accessors, volatile, or macro). If irq_base is actually a macro or accessor that invokes code containing for-loops, that must be inspected.\n\n- definition of the type/struct for metal_softirq_cntr (to see irq_base member)\n  - Explicit struct/type definition (including any member macros) is necessary to confirm that irq_base is a plain data member (no hidden side effects) and to rule out any code executed on member access (macros or inline functions) that could contain for-loops or modify loop counters.\n\n- metal_log (full definition/implementation or macro expansion)\n  - metal_log is called from this function. MISRA's rule states the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. To be certain this function does not introduce (or participate in) malformed for-loops you must inspect metal_log\u2019s implementation (or its macro expansion) and any sub-functions it calls for use of for-statements and whether those loops are well-formed and whether they modify objects that could serve as loop counters outside their scope.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/enum definition)\n  - If METAL_LOG_ERROR is a macro that expands to expressions or calls (rather than a simple integer enumerator), it could introduce code (including loops). Obtain its definition to ensure it has no hidden for-loops or side effects relevant to the rule.\n\n- EINVAL (macro definition)\n  - Although typically a constant errno macro, include its definition to rule out any unexpected macro-expansion that could introduce code with loops or side effects.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for loops. The primary analysis task is to ensure that none of the accessed globals, members, or called routines (or macros used here) expand to or call code that contains for-statements violating the MISRA clauses. The listed symbols (and their full definitions/implementations) are the minimal additional items needed to perform that check."
