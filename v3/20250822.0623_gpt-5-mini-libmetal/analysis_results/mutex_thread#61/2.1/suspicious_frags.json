  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided snippets. Reasoning: the function has a single for-loop whose bounds are a compile-time positive constant (mutex_test_count = 1000), so the loop body and the final return are reachable; there are no early returns, gotos, conditional compilation blocks, or code after an unconditional return within the shown function. The metal_mutex_t definition is only a type declaration (no executable statements). The statements inside the loop are ordinary function calls and are not syntactically unreachable. Therefore, based on the supplied code fragments, there are no code regions that appear unreachable and require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If additional code (macros, other functions, or different definitions of mutex_test_count) exists elsewhere, those should be provided for re-evaluation."
