  "explanation": "No controlling expressions that are invariant were found in the provided code. Rationale by fragment: \n- mutex_thread: for (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++) \u2014 the loop control depends on the loop variable i which is modified each iteration; although mutex_test_count is a compile-time constant, the controlling expression is not invariant. \n- producer_thread: while (counter == COUNTER_MAX) metal_condition_wait(...); \u2014 the condition depends on the variable counter which is modified by threads; it is not an invariant. The wait/release semantics indicate the loop is intended to block until counter changes. \n- consumer_thread: while (!counter) metal_condition_wait(...); \u2014 similarly depends on counter and is not invariant. \nNo other loops or controlling expressions were present in the supplied code. The allowed exceptions (infinite loops using invariant expressions and the do-while constant-false exception) do not apply here."
