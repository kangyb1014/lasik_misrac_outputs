  "explanation": "No occurrences of the <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided target function or in the additional code. The mutex_thread function only calls metal_mutex_acquire, usleep, and metal_mutex_release and returns NULL; the additional symbols are a constant and a metal_mutex_t typedef; none of these fragments use string.h APIs or pointer arithmetic that would invoke the Rule 21.17 concern. The only functions called (metal_mutex_acquire/release) are external and their implementations are not provided here, so they cannot be examined in this snippet; based on the provided code alone, there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 21.17."
