  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce pointer-to-object types whose pointee const-qualification could/should be assessed. The loop index declaration (int i;) and the for-loop control are ordinary non-pointer objects. The calls to metal_mutex_acquire(l) and metal_mutex_release(l) pass the pointer to functions that presumably operate on and modify the mutex object; these calls themselves do not indicate a missing const qualification on the pointee. The usleep(1) call and the return NULL; statement do not involve pointer-to-object types relevant to the rule. Therefore only the pointer parameter and its assignment to a pointer variable are flagged for investigation."
