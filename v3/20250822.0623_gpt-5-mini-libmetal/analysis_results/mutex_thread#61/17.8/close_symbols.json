  "explanation": "To decide whether mutex_thread() violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be sure the parameter 'arg' is not itself altered directly or indirectly. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (prototype/declaration): Needed to inspect the parameter types of this callee. If its prototype accepted a pointer-to-pointer (e.g. metal_mutex_t **) or took the address of the passed argument through some macro/prototype mismatch, that could result in modification of the original pointer argument. Verifying the exact parameter types/signature ensures that only the object pointed-to (legal) is modified, not the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- metal_mutex_release (prototype/declaration): Same reason as metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 we must confirm its signature does not allow modification of the caller's pointer (e.g. by taking a pointer-to-pointer) or hide side effects that could modify 'arg'.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (type definition/typedef): Knowing the exact type of metal_mutex_t is necessary to verify that the assignment \"metal_mutex_t *l = arg;\" is a simple pointer copy and that metal_mutex_t is not some unusual type (array/compound typedef) that could make the assignment behave differently or imply modification of the parameter.\n\n- mutex_test_count (declaration): The loop bound uses this global; while it does not directly affect whether 'arg' is modified, the declaration/definition confirms it is a separate object and helps rule out any weird name collisions or macros that could have side effects affecting the parameter. It also completes the local/side-effect picture of the function for a conservative MISRA analysis.\n\n(Other calls such as usleep do not interact with the function parameter and therefore are not required for determining compliance with this specific MISRA rule.)"
