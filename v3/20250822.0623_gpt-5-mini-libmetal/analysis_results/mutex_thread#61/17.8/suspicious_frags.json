  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is 'void *arg'; it is not assigned to or otherwise modified anywhere in the function. A local pointer 'metal_mutex_t *l' is initialized from 'arg', but this only copies the pointer value into a local variable \u2014 it does not modify the parameter itself. Calls to metal_mutex_acquire(l) and metal_mutex_release(l) may modify the object pointed to by the pointer (which is permitted by the rule), but they do not modify the pointer parameter. The loop index 'i' is a local variable. The function returns NULL and does not alter 'arg'. Therefore there are no places in this code fragment that violate Rule 17.8."
