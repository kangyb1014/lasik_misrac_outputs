  "explanation": "To determine whether mutex_thread (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analysis must include: \n- metal_mutex_acquire: called by mutex_thread; its implementation might call memcmp (or call helpers that do), so inspect it for prohibited string comparisons. \n- metal_mutex_release: same reason as acquire \u2014 it is called by the target and could contain (or call) memcmp usage. \n- memcmp: the specific standard library function the rule targets; include its symbol to detect direct uses or wrappers/aliases and to check how it is invoked (arguments, caller context). \n- usleep: called by mutex_thread; include to confirm it does not perform any string comparison via memcmp or hide such calls (rare but needed for completeness). \n- mutex_test_count: global variable read by mutex_thread; include to fully understand the loop behavior and whether any code paths could lead to string-comparison calls being executed (e.g., dependent calls guarded by loop count). \n- metal_mutex_t: the lock type passed into acquire/release; include to inspect possible macros, inline functions, or type-based helpers that might perform string comparisons when manipulating the mutex object.\n\nThese symbols give the minimal context needed to trace calls from mutex_thread to any memcmp usage and confirm whether any memcmp invocations are being used to compare null-terminated strings."
