  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for dead-code under Rule 2.2: the function signature and parameter (static void *mutex_thread(void *arg)) are required for the thread entrypoint; the local declarations (metal_mutex_t *l = arg; int i;) are used by the function and removing them would change behaviour or be ill-formed; the for-loop control (for (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++) { ... }) determines iteration count and cannot be removed without changing semantics; the function return (return NULL;) is part of the non-void function contract and its removal could produce undefined behaviour. The compile-time constant mutex_test_count (static const int mutex_test_count = 1000) is non-zero and drives the loop iterations, so it is not dead code."
