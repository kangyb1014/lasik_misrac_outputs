  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mutex_thread:\n```c\nstatic void *mutex_thread(void *arg)\n{\n\tmetal_mutex_t *l = arg;\n\tint i;\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < mutex_test_count; i++) {\n\t\tmetal_mutex_acquire(l);\n\t\tusleep(1);\n\t\tmetal_mutex_release(l);\n\t}\n\n\treturn NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function mutex_thread:\nstatic const int mutex_test_count = 1000\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\t\tmetal_mutex_release(l);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call metal_mutex_release(l) is executed on every loop iteration to relinquish the mutex. Removing it would change program behaviour (other threads would block or deadlock, timing of resource release would differ), so the operation is not dead code. It is reachable and executed, and its removal would affect observable behaviour."
