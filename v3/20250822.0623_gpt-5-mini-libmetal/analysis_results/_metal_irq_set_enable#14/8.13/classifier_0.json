  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer cntr is used to call the controller's irq_set_enable member and is passed (non-const) to that function, which likely modifies controller state. Therefore the pointer must not be const-qualified and declaring it as 'struct metal_irq_controller *cntr;' is appropriate."
