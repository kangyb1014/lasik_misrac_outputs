  "explanation": "- metal_irq_get_controller: The target directly calls this; need its body to confirm it does not (directly or indirectly) call back to _metal_irq_set_enable or otherwise arrange a callback that would form recursion.\n- struct metal_irq_controller: Needed to locate the irq_set_enable member (type, signature) and understand how controller objects are stored/returned by metal_irq_get_controller.\n- metal_irq_controller::irq_set_enable (function-pointer member): The target performs an indirect call through this pointer. Its prototype is required to match call semantics and to know what functions might be invoked.\n- all functions assigned to metal_irq_controller->irq_set_enable (irq_set_enable implementations): Any function that may be stored in that member must be analyzed to see whether it calls _metal_irq_set_enable (directly) or calls other functions that lead back to it (indirect recursion).\n- metal_irq_register: This registration function is a known caller of metal_irq_get_controller in the static graph and is likely where controller objects and their irq_set_enable pointers are set; its body is needed to enumerate which implementations can be assigned.\n- metal_irq_enable and metal_irq_disable: These are callers of _metal_irq_set_enable. An irq_set_enable implementation might call them (or they might be involved in another call chain), which could create an indirect recursion cycle. They must be inspected to detect such cycles.\n\nTogether these symbols allow construction of the full call graph reachable from the indirect function call performed in _metal_irq_set_enable so one can determine whether any path returns to _metal_irq_set_enable (violating the MISRA rule)."
