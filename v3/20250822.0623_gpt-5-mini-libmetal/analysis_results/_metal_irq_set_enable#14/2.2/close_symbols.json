  "explanation": "For determining whether _metal_irq_set_enable is dead code you must know not only its body but whether it is ever reached and whether its actions have observable effects. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- metal_irq_enable: This is a direct caller of _metal_irq_set_enable (per the call graph). You must inspect its use sites and whether it is reachable from the rest of the program to decide if removing _metal_irq_set_enable changes behavior.\n\n- metal_irq_disable: Same reason as metal_irq_enable \u2014 it directly calls the target; callers/uses of these functions determine reachability and impact.\n\n- metal_irq_get_controller: The target calls this function to obtain the controller. You need its implementation to know when it can return NULL, how it determines controllers, and whether calling the target actually invokes a controller operation (affects observability).\n\n- metal_irq_register: metal_irq_get_controller is called by metal_irq_register (per the call graph) and registration logic is central to whether any controller exists; you must inspect register logic to know if controllers are ever installed so that _metal_irq_set_enable can have an effect.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (type/definition): The target dereferences the controller and calls its irq_set_enable member. You need the struct definition to confirm the presence, type and semantics of irq_set_enable (e.g. parameter types, side-effects) and whether accessing it is meaningful.\n\n- irq_set_enable implementations (concrete functions assigned to the function-pointer): Even if _metal_irq_set_enable is reachable, its effect depends on what the called irq_set_enable does. To determine whether removing _metal_irq_set_enable changes program behaviour you must inspect the actual implementations (side-effects, timing, hardware interaction).\n\n- IRQ controller registry (global list/array and accessor used by metal_irq_get_controller): metal_irq_get_controller likely looks up controllers in a global registry. You need that registry symbol(s) and its contents to determine whether any controllers are present at run-time and thus whether the call through irq_set_enable ever happens.\n\n- platform/controller initialization functions that call metal_irq_register: If no controllers are registered at runtime then the target call will be a no-op (early return). You must examine platform init code that registers controllers to determine if controllers get installed on typical builds, making _metal_irq_set_enable relevant.\n\nCollectively these symbols let you decide (a) whether _metal_irq_set_enable is reachable from application/firmware paths, and (b) whether its invocation produces observable effects. Without them you cannot determine if removing _metal_irq_set_enable would or would not change program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
