  "explanation": "To decide if metal_virt2phys participates in a direct or indirect recursive call cycle you must inspect the functions that call it and the functions those callers call, plus any functions it calls that might call back into the caller chain. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: Direct caller of metal_virt2phys (present in the static call graph). Inspect its body to see if it (or functions it calls) lead back to metal_virt2phys.\n- metal_map: Callee of metal_shmem_try_map. Must be checked for any call (direct or via other callees) that eventually reaches metal_virt2phys.\n- metal_unmap: Callee of metal_shmem_try_map. Must be checked for potential call paths back to metal_virt2phys.\n- metal_io_init: Callee of metal_shmem_try_map. Must be checked for potential call paths back to metal_virt2phys (or for registration of callbacks that later call it).\n- metal_shmem_open: Caller of metal_shmem_try_map. Inspect higher-level callers to determine if a cycle exists through the caller chain.\n- metal_log: Called by metal_virt2phys. Although probably a logging helper, its implementation could call back into shmem/mapping code; inspect to rule out indirect recursion.\n- pread: Called by metal_virt2phys. Typically a libc call and unlikely to recurse, but include for completeness if overridden/wrapped in this codebase.\n- strerror: Called by metal_virt2phys. Include to confirm it does not call back into project code that could reach metal_virt2phys.\n- _metal: Global struct referenced by metal_virt2phys (pagemap_fd, page_shift). Inspect this symbol for any function-pointer members or initialization code (e.g., set by metal_io_init) that could cause callbacks into metal_virt2phys.\n\nOnly by inspecting these symbols (their definitions and any further callees/callbacks they register) can you conclusively determine whether metal_virt2phys is part of a recursion cycle and thus violates the MISRA rule."
