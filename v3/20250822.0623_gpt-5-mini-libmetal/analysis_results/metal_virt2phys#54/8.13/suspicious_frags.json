  ],
  "explanation": "No other pointer declarations/uses in this function are candidates for const-qualification: the 'phys' parameter is written to (*phys = ...) and therefore must be a non-const pointer; '&entry' is passed to pread which writes into that buffer and thus cannot be const-qualified; calls to strerror()/metal_log() use standard library/utility interfaces that expect non-const char * or handle internal mutability per their APIs; _metal.pagemap_fd and local variables are not pointers. Therefore only the occurrences listed above need investigation for compliance with the rule."
