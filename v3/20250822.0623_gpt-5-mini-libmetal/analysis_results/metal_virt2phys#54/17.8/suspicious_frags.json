  "explanation": "No code fragments in metal_virt2phys violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters (addr and phys) are not reassigned anywhere in the function \u2014 there are no statements like addr = ... or phys = ....\n- The code does modify the object pointed to by phys via *phys = ..., which is explicitly allowed by the rule.\n- addr is only read (cast to uintptr_t and used in an expression) and is not modified.\n- Calls to pread, strerror, and the metal_log macro do not change the pointer parameters themselves.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
