  "explanation": "- struct metal_device (definition): The target reads dev and dev->bus; to find which function pointer is actually invoked you must locate the device structure definition to learn the exact type/layout of the bus/ops member.\n- struct metal_sg (definition): The SG structure is passed through to dev_dma_unmap. To decide whether memcmp is used to compare NUL-terminated strings you need to know whether fields in metal_sg are string buffers or binary data.\n- struct metal_bus (definition): dev->bus is the intermediate object that holds the ops pointer. Its definition shows how ops are populated and which implementations may be used for this device.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (definition) / dev_dma_unmap function-pointer prototype: The ops struct declares the dev_dma_unmap pointer (its prototype). You need the prototype to trace call sites and match implementations correctly (and to know what arguments could be strings).\n- All concrete implementations assigned to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap (each function name): The target function only forwards to this function pointer. To detect any use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings you must inspect the actual implementation(s) that may be invoked (and any variants identified in the static call graph).\n- memcmp (declaration and all direct usages): The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, so you must find every memcmp call in the reachable implementations and examine how its arguments are formed (are they string pointers?).\n- Any functions called transitively by the dev_dma_unmap implementations (each function name): memcmp misuse may occur deeper than the immediate implementation. You must include every function called (transitively) by the dev_dma_unmap implementations so those bodies can be scanned for memcmp usage and for whether the buffers compared are NUL-terminated strings."
