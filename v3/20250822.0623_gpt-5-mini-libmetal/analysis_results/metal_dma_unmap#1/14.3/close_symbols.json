  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions in metal_dma_unmap are invariant (i.e. always evaluate to the same value) the analyzer needs the definitions and declarations that determine whether those expressions can vary at runtime or are compile-time constants:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: The left-hand constant in (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R). Need its value/definition to see if the comparison is against a compile-time constant or an alias to something that might change.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): The condition checks \"!dev\" and dereferences dev->bus. The struct definition shows whether the bus pointer or related fields have special qualifiers (volatile) or are constant, and whether accesses could be considered invariant.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): Required to interpret dev->bus and to know whether bus is a simple pointer, a constant, or has special attributes affecting invariance.\n\n- struct metal_bus::ops (definition) / ops struct type: The code tests \"!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap\". The ops struct definition reveals whether dev_dma_unmap is a data member (function pointer) and any qualifiers that affect mutability.\n\n- dev_dma_unmap (member) declaration/type: Needed to know if this is a compile-time fixed symbol (e.g. macro/inline constant) or a runtime-modifiable function pointer; that determines whether the test of it can be invariant.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): The condition tests \"!sg\". The sg type definition (and any qualifiers) is needed to know if sg can vary or is effectively constant/immutable in the calling context.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence (prototype): Although not a controlling expression, its presence alongside memory_order_* may indicate stdatomic usage; the prototype/headers can show whether memory_order_* are constants/macros or special objects affecting expression evaluation.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: Definitions show whether these are simple compile-time constants (usual case) or something else; this helps rule out hidden invariance reasoning tied to atomic primitives.\n\n- uint32_t (typedef) / qualifiers on dir: To determine whether dir is a plain modifiable value or has qualifiers (volatile, const) that could make (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R) invariant within this function.\n\nThese symbols let a static analyser determine whether the two controlling expressions in the function (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R) and (!dev || !dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap || !sg) can be treated as compile-time or otherwise invariant, or whether they depend on runtime-modifiable objects and thus do not violate the MISRA rule."
