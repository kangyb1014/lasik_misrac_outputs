  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were excluded because they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 (pointer-to-const) or are already const/output/obviously modifiable: - The atomic_thread_fence calls and the null-check/return logic do not involve pointer type qualifications and so are not relevant. - The dev_open declaration already uses const for dev_name, so no issue there. - The dev_open parameter struct metal_device **device and dev_dma_map\u2019s sg_out are output parameters (pointers meant to be written by the callee) and therefore cannot be made pointer-to-const. - Bus/device operations such as bus_close, dev_close, and dev_irq_ack likely require modification of the bus/device state (so their pointer parameters are intentionally non-const) and were not flagged. The listed fragments are the places where input pointers are accepted as non-const and thus should be investigated for possible const-qualification per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
