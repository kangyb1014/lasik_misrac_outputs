If implementations of dev_dma_unmap are not expected to modify the scatter-gather entries, the parameter should be declared const (const struct metal_sg *sg). Because the pointer is not const-qualified where it could be, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_dma_unmap:\nstruct metal_bus_ops {\n\tvoid\t\t(*bus_close)(struct metal_bus *bus);\n\tint\t\t(*dev_open)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t    const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t\t    struct metal_device **device);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_close)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_irq_ack)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t       int irq);\n\tint\t\t(*dev_dma_map)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t       uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t\t       int nents_in,\n\t\t\t\t       struct metal_sg *sg_out);\n\tvoid\t\t(*dev_dma_unmap)(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t\t\t struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t\t\t uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t\t\t struct metal_sg *sg,\n\t\t\t\t\t int nents);\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA 8.13 advises using const-qualified pointees when the code will not modify the pointed-to object, but you must consider the whole API boundary. metal_dma_unmap simply forwards the sg pointer to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap whose prototype takes struct metal_sg * (non-const). The wrapper cannot legitimately make its parameter const without either changing the underlying ops prototype or performing a cast (which would discard const and itself violate other rules). Furthermore, there is no evidence here that implementations do not modify the scatter\u2011gather entries \u2014 the ops signature implies they may. The correct remedy, if the entries truly must be immutable, is to change the ops declaration to take const struct metal_sg * (an API change), not to mark only the wrapper const. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
