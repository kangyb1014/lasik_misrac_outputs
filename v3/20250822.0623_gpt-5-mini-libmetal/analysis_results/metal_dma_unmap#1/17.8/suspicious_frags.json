  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to any parameter variables (no statements like dev = ..., sg = ..., dir = ..., or nents = ...).\n- The pointer parameters (dev and sg) are dereferenced (e.g., dev->bus, dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap and passed to the callee), but the pointer objects themselves are not reassigned or incremented \u2014 dereferencing or passing a pointer is allowed under MISRA Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified).\n- The integer parameters (dir, nents) are only read (dir compared to METAL_DMA_DEV_R), not written.\n- The call dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap(dev->bus, dev, dir, sg, nents) may allow the callee to modify the objects pointed to (permitted), but this is not a modification of the parameter variables within this function.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing to report for investigation under that rule."
