If the bus ops entry dev_dma_unmap is set (directly or via a wrapper) to metal_dma_unmap, then dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap(...) will call metal_dma_unmap again, producing indirect recursion and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's scenario is correct in principle. metal_dma_unmap calls a function through the pointer dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap; if that pointer (directly or via a wrapper) ends up invoking metal_dma_unmap again, an indirect recursion occurs and Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls) is violated. The source code as shown does not prove that the function pointer cannot be set to metal_dma_unmap (or to a function that calls it), so the call is potentially recursive and therefore non\u2011conforming unless there is an external invariant that guarantees the pointer cannot refer (directly or indirectly) back to metal_dma_unmap."
