  "scenario": "The fragment shown is only a null-pointer/function-pointer check and early return; it does not perform any call and therefore does not by itself cause direct or indirect recursion. Thus the fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. (Note: in the full function, if dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_unmap were set to point back to metal_dma_unmap, the subsequent call through that pointer would produce indirect recursion and would violate Rule 17.2.)"
