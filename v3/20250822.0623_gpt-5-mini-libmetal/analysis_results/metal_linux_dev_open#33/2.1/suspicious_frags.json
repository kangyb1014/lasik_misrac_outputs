  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns because:\n- The initial allocation ldev = malloc(sizeof(*ldev)); and its null check (if (!ldev) return -ENOMEM;) are reachable and ensure ldev is non-NULL on entry to the driver loop when allocation succeeds.\n- The main loop (for_each_linux_driver...) can execute zero or more iterations depending on available drivers; both the successful-open path (calling dev_open, adding the device, returning 0) and the failure path (dev_open returning error, calling dev_close, continuing) are reachable depending on runtime conditions.\n- The post-loop cleanup (if (ldev) free(ldev); return -ENODEV;) is reachable when no suitable driver opens the device.\n- Other statements (memset, strncpy, fd/ldrv/device assignments, list add) are executed in the successful-open path and are therefore reachable.\nGiven these reachable execution paths, no other fragments appear to be statically unreachable and thus do not warrant further investigation under Rule 2.1."
