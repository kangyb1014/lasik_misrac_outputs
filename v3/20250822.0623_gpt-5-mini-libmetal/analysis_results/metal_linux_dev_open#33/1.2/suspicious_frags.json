  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses standard C constructs: variable declarations, malloc/free, sizeof, memset, strncpy, pointer dereferences, function-pointer calls, and return statements \u2014 none of these are compiler language extensions by themselves. There are no explicit GCC/Clang extension tokens in the shown code (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }) usage, nested functions, labels-as-values, or other vendor-specific keywords). The three reported fragments are macro or helper-API usages that commonly hide compiler-specific extensions in their definitions (for example, container_of/to_* macros and list/iteration macros in Linux often use typeof or statement expressions, which are documented GNU extensions). Those macro invocations should be inspected where they are defined to determine if they rely on compiler-specific extensions. Other lines in the function do not warrant investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the provided source."
