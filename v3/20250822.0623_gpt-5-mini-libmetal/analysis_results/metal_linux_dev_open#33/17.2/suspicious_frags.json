  "explanation": "Only indirect calls via function pointers can produce indirect recursion back into metal_linux_dev_open; the two statements above are the only calls in this function that invoke driver-supplied function pointers and therefore must be investigated for possible self-calls. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: to_linux_bus/metal_container_of is a macro returning a container pointer (no call chain to the target function); the for_each_linux_driver macro is just a loop construct (no function call that could recurse); standard library calls (malloc, free, memset, strncpy) are ordinary library routines and are not expected to call back into this function; metal_list_add_tail is a list-manipulation helper (no driver-supplied callback in the shown code) and does not present an obvious indirect call path to metal_linux_dev_open. The checks of ldrv->sdrv and the pointer arithmetic/assignments (setting ldev fields, *device = &ldev->device, etc.) are not function calls and therefore cannot create recursive function calls by themselves."
