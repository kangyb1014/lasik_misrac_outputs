  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA <string.h> bound-check analysis:\n\n- struct linux_device\n  - Contains the dev_name member and determines sizeof(*ldev). You must know the exact type and array length of dev_name to check whether strncpy(..., sizeof(ldev->dev_name) - 1) can write out of bounds and to confirm that memset(ldev, 0, sizeof(*ldev)) covers the entire allocated object.\n\n- struct linux_driver\n  - Declares the dev_open and dev_close function pointer types and any associated semantics. Their prototypes and expected behavior are needed to reason about whether calls through ldrv->dev_open/dev_close can alter ldev (reallocate/free) or expect different invariants about dev_name, which affects whether subsequent memset/strncpy operate on a valid object.\n\n- for_each_linux_driver (macro)\n  - Defines the iteration mechanism and the lifetime/initialization of the ldrv loop variable. This is required to ensure ldrv is valid when referenced (and to understand possible control flows that affect ldev usage).\n\n- memset (from <string.h>)\n  - The standard semantics of memset are required to check that the size argument (sizeof(*ldev)) matches the actual allocated object size and therefore does not write beyond the destination object bounds.\n\n- strncpy (from <string.h>)\n  - The standard semantics of strncpy (how many bytes are read from source, how padding works, and null-termination guarantees) are required to determine whether the call strncpy(ldev->dev_name, dev_name, sizeof(ldev->dev_name) - 1) can cause reads/writes outside the destination/source objects.\n\n- Drivers' dev_open / dev_close implementations (ldrv->dev_open, ldrv->dev_close)\n  - Concrete driver code can free or reinitialize ldev (or otherwise mutate ldev->dev_name). To determine whether memset/strncpy can access freed or reallocated memory, the implementations (or at least their contract) must be known.\n\n- Callers / API contract for metal_linux_dev_open (the provenance and guarantees for the dev_name argument)\n  - The safety of strncpy also depends on the source string: whether dev_name is a valid, NUL-terminated buffer and any maximum length guarantees. You need the prototypes/call sites or API documentation that specify dev_name lifetime and termination to rule out out-of-bounds reads of the source or assumptions about its length.\n\n- malloc / free semantics used for ldev allocation\n  - Confirm that ldev is allocated with malloc(sizeof(*ldev)) and that no other allocator/allocator wrapper changes the allocation size or behavior; combined with struct linux_device this ensures memset size matches the actual allocation. Also needed to reason about ownership/lifetime when drivers are called.\n\nIn short: the structural definition of linux_device (dev_name size and overall sizeof), the driver interface and implementations (dev_open/dev_close), the for_each_linux_driver iteration, the exact semantics of memset/strncpy, and the provenance/contract of the dev_name argument (and allocation/free behaviour) are required to determine whether the memset/strncpy calls can access memory beyond object bounds and thus violate the MISRA rule."
