True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable is declared as 'struct linux_driver *ldrv' but in the shown code it is only used to read members and call functions (no modification of the pointed-to object). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. 'const struct linux_driver *ldrv'). Because it is not const-qualified here, this is a violation (unless other code not shown requires modification of the driver object through this pointer).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's observation is superficially reasonable (ldrv is only read in the shown snippet), but the report is not sufficiently justified given the rest of the code. In this function ldrv is stored into ldev->ldrv (ldev->ldrv = ldrv). Unless the linux_device.ldrv member is also declared as a pointer to const, changing the local declaration to const struct linux_driver *ldrv would create an incompatible assignment or require a cast. Also the for_each_linux_driver macro and other uses of ldrv elsewhere in the codebase may expect a non-const pointer. Because we cannot see the definitions of struct linux_device, struct linux_driver, or the iterator macro, we cannot conclude that making ldrv const is possible without broader API changes. Therefore the claim of a definite MISRA 8.13 violation is not correct based on the provided snippet alone."
