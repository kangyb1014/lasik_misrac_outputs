  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_dma_map is dead code (removable without changing program behaviour) you must know whether it is ever referenced or whether removing it would remove observable behaviour. Concretely:\n\n- All static/global symbols in the same translation unit: metal_linux_dev_dma_map is declared static (internal linkage). If it is not referenced anywhere in the same C file, it is dead. You must therefore inspect every static function and global in that file to find any caller or indirect reference.\n\n- Any static initializer or function-pointer table in the file that could assign &metal_linux_dev_dma_map: functions with internal linkage are frequently exposed only via function-pointer tables. If this function address is stored in an ops struct (e.g. device/bus ops) then it is reachable; those initializers must be examined.\n\n- Definitions of to_linux_device and to_linux_bus: if the function is called, these callees execute. If removal would eliminate calls to these functions and they have side effects, behaviour changes. You need their definitions to determine side effects and whether their calls make the target function necessary.\n\n- Definition of struct linux_device and struct linux_driver (and their relevant fields): the function dereferences ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. Understanding the types and assignment sites of ldrv and dev_dma_map helps determine whether this call is meaningful, whether dev_dma_map can alias other functions, and whether removing metal_linux_dev_dma_map would affect behaviour via aliases.\n\n- Definition of struct linux_bus: similar reason \u2014 to understand any side effects or relationships that make the function necessary.\n\n- Any registration/initialization functions that export or assign the file's ops table(s) externally: even though the function is static, an ops struct from the file may be exposed/registered (e.g. via a registration API) so the function can be invoked from other translation units. Those registration points determine reachability.\n\n- Build/compilation-unit visibility information: confirms that the function truly has internal linkage and whether any build-generated code, linker scripts, or macros could reference it indirectly. This is necessary to conclude removability safely.\n\nCollecting these symbols/files allows a complete reachability and side-effect analysis required by MISRA's dead-code rule: you can prove the function has no internal or indirect references (dead), or find at least one use/side-effect (not dead)."
