  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_dev_dma_map (or any code it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we must inspect not only the small wrapper shown but also any code it calls or dispatches to that could perform such a comparison: \n\n- to_linux_device (function definition): The target calls this helper; it might itself use memcmp on strings. We need its body to check for forbidden memcmp usage.\n- to_linux_bus (function definition): Same rationale as above for the other direct callee.\n- struct linux_device (type/definition): Required to identify the ldrv member and its type so we can find the driver structure and its callbacks.\n- struct linux_bus (type/definition): Needed to understand the argument passed into dev_dma_map and to inspect any inline or macro code that might operate on bus fields and use memcmp.\n- definition of the driver structure pointed to by linux_device->ldrv (type name and full field declarations): The wrapper calls ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map; we must know the driver struct type and the exact member name/type to locate the dev_dma_map declaration and its implementations.\n- declaration/prototype of the dev_dma_map function pointer: To identify the function signature and linkage so we can locate all concrete implementations and inspect them for memcmp usage.\n- all concrete implementations/functions assigned to ldrv->dev_dma_map: The wrapper delegates work to whatever function(s) implement dev_dma_map; those implementations are the most likely place to use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings. Each implementation must be examined for forbidden memcmp usage.\n\nExamining these symbols (the direct callees, the types that locate the callback, the callback declaration, and the callback implementations) is sufficient to determine whether any code reachable from metal_linux_dev_dma_map uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
