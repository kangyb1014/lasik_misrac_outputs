  "scenario": "The pointer is assigned from to_linux_device(device) and is subsequently passed to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map. Because the callee likely requires a modifiable (non-const) linux_device pointer, the non-const declaration is appropriate. This fragment by itself does not demonstrate that ldev could be const; only if dev_dma_map and all downstream usage are proven not to modify the pointed object would declaring ldev as const be possible \u2014 otherwise changing it would break the API."
