  "explanation": "I examined the target function metal_linux_dev_dma_map and the related type and helper-function fragments provided. I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the shown code: there are no occurrences of GCC/Clang-specific tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords or constructs. The code uses standard C constructs (structs, pointers, function calls, uint32_t, array members sized by macros like PATH_MAX, and a macro invocation metal_container_of). \n\nThe only location that could potentially hide an extension is the macro metal_container_of (used in to_linux_device and to_linux_bus). Its implementation was not provided; if that macro internally uses a compiler-specific extension (for example, typeof or statement-expressions), that would be a Rule 1.2 violation \u2014 but that cannot be determined from the fragments shown. To decide whether an extension is used, the macro definition should be inspected. \n\nNote: The snippet appears to omit the terminating semicolon for struct declarations in the excerpt, which is a syntactic issue, not evidence of a language extension; it does not trigger Rule 1.2. Therefore, based on the provided code alone, there are no code fragments that must be investigated for Rule 1.2."
