  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter. The function only reads the parameters and assigns converted values to local variables (ldev and lbus) via to_linux_device(device) and to_linux_bus(bus); these do not modify the parameter variables themselves. There are no assignments to parameters (e.g., device = ..., bus = ..., dir = ..., nents_in = ..., sg_in = ..., sg_out = ...), no increments/decrements of parameters, and no address reassignment. Passing the pointer parameters to ldev->ldrv->dev_dma_map may allow that callee to modify the objects pointed to (which is permitted by Rule 17.8), but the pointer variables in this function are not modified. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
