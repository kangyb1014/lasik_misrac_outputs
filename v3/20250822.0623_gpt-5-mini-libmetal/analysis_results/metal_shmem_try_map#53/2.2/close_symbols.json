  "explanation": "To determine whether any statements in metal_shmem_try_map are actually dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) we must know the possible runtime values and side effects of external/global symbols used by the function. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- _metal.pagemap_fd\n  - Controls the big conditional in the function. If _metal.pagemap_fd is always < 0 (or always >= 0) in the deployed system then the entire virt2phys loop (and the alternate fallback path) would never execute; proving or refuting that makes one branch dead code. You need the definition and possible runtime values of this global to decide reachability and whether removal would affect behaviour.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (page_size, page_shift, mmap_flags)\n  - page_size determines the computed pages count and thereby whether the for-loop executes at all; page_shift is passed to metal_io_init and may affect later behaviour (so initialization may not be removable); mmap_flags affect metal_map call. Knowledge of the structure and the range of its members (and how callers set them) is required to assess whether loop/initialization/logging are ever effective.\n\n- metal_align_up\n  - Alters the input size and thus pages. To know if the pages computation (and associated loop/allocations) is ever non-zero you must know how metal_align_up behaves for all possible inputs.\n\n- mlock\n  - Its return determines whether the warning log path (metal_log call) can execute. If mlock never fails on the target platform then the error-handling log is dead (i.e. removable without behavioural change); conversely if it can fail then the log is semantically relevant. You need mlock semantics on the target environment.\n\n- errno\n  - Used when logging mlock errors via strerror(errno). To evaluate whether those logs are meaningful and have side effects you need to know how errno is set in the platform and whether its use can affect program behaviour.\n\n- strerror\n  - Produces a string for logging; if logging calls are considered behavioural effects (timing/IO), removing calls to strerror/metal_log could change observable behaviour. Knowing strerror semantics (and thread-safety/errno dependence) is necessary to judge removability.\n\n- metal_log\n  - The function used for warnings. Whether calls to metal_log are removable depends on whether logging has observable effects in the system (I/O, timing, state). You must know metal_log's side effects and whether logs influence program behaviour (e.g. through diagnostics, callbacks, or altering global state).\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The logging level constant passed to metal_log. Its definition may determine whether a metal_log invocation actually does anything (e.g. compiled out at certain levels). If the constant disables logging in the build, the log call might be effectively dead; you need to know its definition/config.\n\n- malloc\n  - The code tests malloc failure and does conditional cleanup/returns. If the allocator on the target platform is guaranteed never to return NULL (or always returns NULL), the NULL-check branches (and corresponding free/metal_unmap calls) might be dead. You must know allocator guarantees to decide.\n\n- free\n  - Used in cleanup. To judge whether the free calls are removable without changing behaviour you need to know ownership/side-effects of freeing the phys array and whether retaining the allocation would affect program behaviour (leak vs required release).\n\n- METAL_BAD_OFFSET\n  - Assigned to phys entries when metal_virt2phys fails. Whether these assignments are meaningful (and therefore non-dead) depends on how downstream code (metal_io_init/IO ops) interprets the sentinel. You need its definition and semantics.\n\n- metal_shmem_io_ops\n  - The ops structure passed to metal_io_init. If these ops ignore the phys array or do not use page-shift, some initializations/assignments in this function could be dead. Knowing the ops implementation and how they use the provided io/phys data is necessary to judge removability.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (layout/ownership semantics)\n  - The result io object and its ownership, lifetime and how metal_io_init stores or copies pointers determines whether constructing and populating phys[] and the mem pointer are observable side-effects. If metal_io_init copies everything, freeing phys afterwards may be safe; if it stores the pointer, freeing would change behaviour. You need the struct definition and metal_io_init/ops contracts.\n\nSummary: proving a statement is dead requires knowledge about the platform/global state, the possible runtime values of configuration/global variables, and the side-effects of the external functions called (especially logging, allocator, mlock and the IO ops). The symbols above are the minimal additional items (beyond the call-graph callees) needed to decide whether code paths in metal_shmem_try_map are removable without changing program behaviour."
