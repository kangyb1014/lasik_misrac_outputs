  "explanation": "- metal_run: atomic calls metal_run directly; to decide if atomic is (indirectly) recursive we must inspect metal_run's implementation to see if it calls atomic or calls routines that eventually call atomic.\n- metal_run_noblock: listed as a callee of metal_run in the static call graph. It could call back to metal_run or to atomic (creating indirect recursion), so its body must be examined.\n- metal_finish_threads: another direct callee of metal_run. It might call functions that lead back to atomic or metal_run; inspect it for possible indirect recursion.\n- atomic_thread: this is the thread entry function pointer passed into metal_run. metal_run will invoke this (in new threads); if atomic_thread calls atomic or calls metal_run (directly or via other functions), that creates indirect recursion. The thread routine must be analyzed.\n- (all transitive callees of the above): to prove absence of indirect self-calls you need the transitive closure of callees starting from metal_run, metal_run_noblock, metal_finish_threads and atomic_thread (i.e., every function they call, and every function those call, etc.), because recursion may occur several levels deep."
