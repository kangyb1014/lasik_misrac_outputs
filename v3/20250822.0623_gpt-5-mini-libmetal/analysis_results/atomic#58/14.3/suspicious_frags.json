  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and therefore no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale: \n\n- atomic(): the two conditionals use runtime values \u2014 if (!error) depends on the return from metal_run, and if (value) depends on value computed from atomic_load; neither is invariant.\n- atomic_thread(): the loop for (i = 0; i < atomic_test_count; i++) is not invariant because the controlling expression depends on the loop variable i which is modified each iteration. Although atomic_test_count is declared as a const, the overall controlling expression\u2019s value changes as i changes, so it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n- There are no do-while or while loops with a compile-time constant controlling expression, nor any explicit infinite-loop constructs that rely on an invariant condition.\n- Other uses of constants (e.g., const int threads = 10 and static const int atomic_test_count = 1000) are not controlling expressions themselves (threads is used as an argument/array size), so they do not trigger Rule 14.3.\n\nBecause every loop and selection shown has a controlling expression that can change at runtime, none of the provided fragments violate Rule 14.3 and thus no fragments were flagged for further investigation."
