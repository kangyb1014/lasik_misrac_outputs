  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_init:\n```c\nvoid metal_io_init(struct metal_io_region *io, void *virt,\n\t      const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap, size_t size,\n\t      unsigned int page_shift, unsigned int mem_flags,\n\t      const struct metal_io_ops *ops)\n{\n\tconst struct metal_io_ops nops = {\n\t\tNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL\n\t};\n\n\tio->virt = virt;\n\tio->physmap = physmap;\n\tio->size = size;\n\tio->page_shift = page_shift;\n\tif (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n\t\t/* avoid overflow */\n\t\tio->page_mask = -1UL;\n\telse\n\t\tio->page_mask = (1UL << page_shift) - 1UL;\n\tio->mem_flags = mem_flags;\n\tio->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\n\tmetal_sys_io_mem_map(io);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n\t\t/* avoid overflow */\n\t\tio->page_mask = -1UL;\n\telse\n\t\tio->page_mask = (1UL << page_shift) - 1UL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The conditional protects against shifting by >= width-of(page_mask) bits. Both branches can be reached depending on the runtime value of page_shift, and removing the check (or either assignment) would change behaviour (it would allow an out-of-range shift and/or produce an incorrect page_mask), so this is not dead code."
