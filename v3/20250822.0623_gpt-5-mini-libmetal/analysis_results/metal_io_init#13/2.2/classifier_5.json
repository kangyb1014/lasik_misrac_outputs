  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_init:\n```c\nvoid metal_io_init(struct metal_io_region *io, void *virt,\n\t      const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap, size_t size,\n\t      unsigned int page_shift, unsigned int mem_flags,\n\t      const struct metal_io_ops *ops)\n{\n\tconst struct metal_io_ops nops = {\n\t\tNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL\n\t};\n\n\tio->virt = virt;\n\tio->physmap = physmap;\n\tio->size = size;\n\tio->page_shift = page_shift;\n\tif (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n\t\t/* avoid overflow */\n\t\tio->page_mask = -1UL;\n\telse\n\t\tio->page_mask = (1UL << page_shift) - 1UL;\n\tio->mem_flags = mem_flags;\n\tio->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\n\tmetal_sys_io_mem_map(io);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconst struct metal_io_ops nops = {\n\t\tNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL\n\t};\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The local const initializer nops is used as the fallback value in the expression io->ops = ops ? *ops : nops; and initialisation is not considered dead code per MISRA note 3. Therefore, in the general case this fragment is not a Rule 2.2 violation because nops may be used when the caller passes ops == NULL. A specific violation scenario would be: if, across the entire project, every call to metal_io_init can be proven (by code inspection or static analysis) to always pass a non-NULL ops pointer, then nops is never used and its presence (and its initialization) would be dead code \u2014 removing it would not affect program behaviour, which would violate Rule 2.2."
