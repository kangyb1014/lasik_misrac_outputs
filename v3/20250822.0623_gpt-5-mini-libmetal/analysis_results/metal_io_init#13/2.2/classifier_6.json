Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_init:\n```c\nvoid metal_io_init(struct metal_io_region *io, void *virt,\n\t      const metal_phys_addr_t *physmap, size_t size,\n\t      unsigned int page_shift, unsigned int mem_flags,\n\t      const struct metal_io_ops *ops)\n{\n\tconst struct metal_io_ops nops = {\n\t\tNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL\n\t};\n\n\tio->virt = virt;\n\tio->physmap = physmap;\n\tio->size = size;\n\tio->page_shift = page_shift;\n\tif (page_shift >= sizeof(io->page_mask) * CHAR_BIT)\n\t\t/* avoid overflow */\n\t\tio->page_mask = -1UL;\n\telse\n\t\tio->page_mask = (1UL << page_shift) - 1UL;\n\tio->mem_flags = mem_flags;\n\tio->ops = ops ? *ops : nops;\n\tmetal_sys_io_mem_map(io);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_sys_io_mem_map(io);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call metal_sys_io_mem_map(io) is not provably dead from the excerpt alone. A function call is assumed to have observable side\u2011effects (e.g. perform memory mapping, touch hardware, modify globals, or affect timing), so in the normal case this is not dead code. However, a violation would occur if metal_sys_io_mem_map is defined with no observable effects \u2014 for example if it is an empty/no\u2011op function (static inline void metal_sys_io_mem_map(struct metal_io_region *io) { } ), or only performs computations whose results are discarded and it does not modify any state or interact with volatile objects/timing. In that case the call could be removed without changing program behaviour and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
