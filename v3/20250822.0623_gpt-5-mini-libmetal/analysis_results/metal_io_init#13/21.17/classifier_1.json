  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement io->size = size is a plain assignment and does not call any <string.h> functions. Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.) that may access beyond object bounds; this assignment by itself cannot cause such an out-of-bounds access. (A violation would arise only if io->size were later used as a length in a string.h call that copies more bytes than the destination can hold.)"
