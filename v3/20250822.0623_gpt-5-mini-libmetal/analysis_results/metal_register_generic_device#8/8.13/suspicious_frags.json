  "explanation": "Fragments not reported as suspicious and why:\n- device->name is declared as const char *name; it is already const-qualified and only read (strlen), so Rule 8.13 is satisfied for that pointer.\n- The function parameter struct metal_device *device and the struct metal_device fields that represent mutable state (regions array, node, irq_num, irq_info) are intentionally mutable: the function modifies device->bus and updates the device list (metal_list_add_tail) which requires modifying node/linked-list pointers. Making these pointers/objects const would prevent necessary mutations, so they are not flagged.\n- The linked-list pointers (struct metal_list *next, *prev) must remain mutable because list operations update them; they are therefore not candidates for const-qualification.\n- Other symbols referenced (e.g. extern struct metal_state _metal) represent mutable global state used for device registration and are not flagged because they are intended to be modified.\n- Function pointer entries inside metal_generic_bus.ops are pointers to functions (not pointers to data that could be const-qualified in the sense of Rule 8.13) and are used as callbacks; they are not considered violations of this rule in this context.\n\nThe flagged fragments focus on the bus pointer and the global bus instance because assigning &metal_generic_bus to a non-const struct metal_bus * suggests the bus object or the device->bus member might be better qualified with const to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 if the bus contents are immutable."
