  "explanation": "To decide whether this function or the pointers it uses violate the MISRA guidance that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, the analyzer must see the types and const-qualification of the referenced objects and the prototypes of called routines:\n\n- struct metal_device: The complete definition (at least the declarations/types of .name, .bus, .num_regions, and .node) is required to know whether device->name is declared as char * or const char *, whether device->bus is a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const, and what type node has. These const qualifiers are central to the MISRA check.\n\n- metal_generic_bus: The declaration/type (including any const qualifier) of this symbol is needed because device->bus is assigned &metal_generic_bus. To determine if the assignment violates the rule you must know whether the bus object is const-qualified and whether device->bus points-to-const.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: The prototype (parameter types and const qualifiers) is required to see whether the function expects/accepts const pointers or non-const pointers for the list head/node. Passing &device->node to a non-const parameter may be acceptable if the function must modify the node, but if the prototype could be const-qualified then the caller might be expected to pass a pointer-to-const.\n\n- struct metal_list: The definition of the list node/list type used by generic_device_list and device->node is needed to determine whether nodes/heads are declared const-qualified or could be const. This ties into both device->node's type (from struct metal_device) and the metal_list_add_tail prototype.\n\n- _metal: The declaration/type of this global (and the type of its .common.generic_device_list field) is needed so the const-qualification of the list head argument (& _metal.common.generic_device_list) can be checked.\n\n- strlen: The prototype (standard: size_t strlen(const char *)) is needed to confirm that strlen takes a const char * parameter so that passing device->name (whatever its declared type is) is checked for compatibility and to decide whether device->name should be const-qualified.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine the declared const-qualification of the pointers passed/assigned in the function and whether those declarations conform to \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\""
