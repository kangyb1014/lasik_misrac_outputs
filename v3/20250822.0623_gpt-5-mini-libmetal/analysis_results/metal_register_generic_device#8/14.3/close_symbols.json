  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required to decide if the if(...) controlling expression can be invariant:\n\n1) struct metal_device (definition including types/qualifiers of .name and .num_regions)\n   - The controlling expression reads device->name and device->num_regions. To determine whether those sub\u2011expressions are compile\u2011time or effectively invariant you must know the exact field types and qualifiers (e.g. is name declared const char * const, is num_regions a const or compile\u2011time constant, are fields volatile, fixed-size array vs pointer). The struct definition also shows whether fields are modifiable at runtime (prevents flagging a runtime variable as invariant).\n\n2) METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro or constant definition/value)\n   - The expression compares device->num_regions to METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS. If METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS is itself a compile\u2011time constant (macro) that affects whether the comparison can be evaluated to an invariant in some contexts. Knowing its definition/value is necessary to decide if that sub\u2011expression (and thus the whole controlling expression) is invariant.\n\n3) strlen (prototype/definition/any macro or builtin mapping)\n   - The code calls strlen(device->name). To assess invariance you must know if strlen is a plain library function, a macro, or a compiler builtin that could be constant\u2011folded for certain arguments. If strlen is a macro/builtin that can be evaluated at compile time for certain inputs, that affects whether the !strlen(device->name) term can be invariant. Also knowing its signature confirms it is non\u2011side\u2011effecting.\n\n4) Any symbol(s)/functions that construct or initialize struct metal_device instances passed into metal_register_generic_device (sites that set device->name and device->num_regions)\n   - Even if fields are not declared const, particular call sites may always pass the same, preinitialized device instances (e.g. statically allocated devices with constant name and num_regions). To conclude whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant in the deployed codebase you must inspect where device objects are created/populated (initializers/constructors) to see if device->name and device->num_regions are constant across all call sites.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as metal_generic_bus, metal_list_add_tail, EINVAL, or _metal are not relevant to deciding whether the controlling expression is invariant and so are omitted.)"
