  "explanation": "Only the memset call invokes a standard <string.h> function in this snippet and therefore is the only candidate that can directly cause out-of-bounds access per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The other lines do not call <string.h> functions: eventfd(...) is a syscall wrapper, metal_mutex_init(...), metal_irq_register_controller(...), pthread_create(...), and metal_log(...) are not direct uses of the <string.h> API in the shown code. Consequently, they cannot, by themselves in this fragment, produce accesses beyond the bounds via the standard string handling functions and need not be investigated for Rule 21.17 based on the provided snippet."
