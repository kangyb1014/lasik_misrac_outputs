  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified). Reasoning:\n- The function has a single parameter, 'int irq', which is only read in the conditional 'if (irq >= irq_base && irq < irq_end)' and is never assigned to or otherwise modified.\n- There are no pointer parameters to this function; rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters (and specifically the pointer parameter itself), which does not apply here.\n- All pointer variables in the function ('node' and 'cntr') are local variables; assignments to them do not modify any function parameter.\n- The call to the macro 'metal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node)' passes the address of a global/static list ('irq_cntrs'), not any function parameter, so it cannot violate the rule for this function's parameter.\n- Assignments to 'irq_base' and 'irq_end' are to local variables and reads from the controller structure; they do not modify the function parameter.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under Rule 17.8."
