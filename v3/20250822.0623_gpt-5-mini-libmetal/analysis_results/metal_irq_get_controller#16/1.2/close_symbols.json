  "explanation": "- metal_container_of (macro definition and helpers): The target uses metal_container_of to obtain the enclosing struct. Common implementations use GCC extensions (typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... })) or other non\u2011standard constructs. You must inspect the exact macro expansion (and any helper macros it uses) to determine whether a compiler language extension is present.\n- metal_list_for_each (macro definition): This loop construct is a macro; some list macros hide statement-expressions, comma-operator tricks, or non-standard for-loop constructs. Check its definition to ensure it does not rely on compiler extensions.\n- struct metal_irq_controller (full definition): The function reads members irq_base and irq_num and performs arithmetic. Inspecting the struct is necessary to detect any use of non\u2011standard features in its declaration (anonymous/extension-specific members, unusual attributes or GCC-specific type extensions) that would constitute language extensions.\n- struct metal_list (full definition): The list node type used by the macros could contain anonymous unions/structs, bitfields, or other compiler\u2011specific extensions. The macro implementations may also rely on particular member names and types, so the struct layout must be checked.\n- irq_cntrs (declaration/definition): The global list head may be defined or initialized using compound literals, GCC attributes, or other extensions. Its declaration/definition is needed to verify no language extensions are used.\n\nProviding these symbols (macro expansions and type/variable definitions) lets the analyzer determine whether any non\u2011standard language constructs (e.g. typeof, statement-expression, __attribute__ usage, compiler-specific keywords) are used by the code invoked by metal_irq_get_controller."
