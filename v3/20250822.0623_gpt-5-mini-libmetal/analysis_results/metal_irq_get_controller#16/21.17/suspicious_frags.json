  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The provided function metal_irq_get_controller and the related type definitions do not invoke any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) nor do they call other functions that are shown which might wrap those string functions. The function only uses list-iteration macros, container_of casting, simple integer arithmetic and comparisons, and pointer returns. Therefore there are no uses of the specified string handling functions in the supplied code that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17."
