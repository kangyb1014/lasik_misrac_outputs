  "explanation": "- struct metal_irq_controller: The target reads cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num and accesses the node member. You must see the struct definition to know the types, field names, and any other members (or embedded arrays) that could hide calls to string.h functions or affect pointer arithmetic/bounds.\n- struct metal_list: The list node type and its layout are needed because the iteration macro/function operates on it; its definition may reveal inline helpers or member types that could call string functions.\n- irq_cntrs: The global list head passed to metal_list_for_each; its declaration/initialization is required to inspect how iteration starts and to verify there are no hidden string.h calls in its setup.\n- metal_list_for_each (macro or function): This is used to iterate the list. You must inspect its expansion/implementation to ensure it does not call any <string.h> functions (or otherwise perform out-of-bounds memory accesses).\n- metal_container_of (macro): This macro converts a list node pointer to the enclosing metal_irq_controller pointer. You must inspect its definition (usually uses offsetof) to ensure it is correctly implemented and does not invoke any string.h functions or produce incorrect pointer arithmetic.\n- offsetof (macro): Often used by metal_container_of. Its definition/usage should be checked to ensure correct compile-time offset computation and that no unexpected runtime behavior or hidden library calls occur.\n- NULL (macro): The function returns NULL; include its definition to be complete when inspecting headers/macros for any surprising redefinitions or interactions.\n\nThese symbols let you expand all macros and inspect any inline/helper code reachable from the target function so you can conclusively determine whether any of the standard string.h functions are (directly or indirectly via macros/inline code) used or whether any pointer arithmetic could lead to out-of-bounds accesses related to the string-handling rule."
