  "explanation": "No calls to any of the Standard Library functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (<string.h> functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The code uses snprintf (from <stdio.h>) to format into a fixed-size buffer and checks for truncation (result >= sizeof(path)) \u2014 so the path buffer is protected against overflow in the documented truncation case. The value string is consumed by strtoul (from <stdlib.h>), which is not one of the <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. The sysfs_open_attribute/sysfs_read_attribute/sysfs_close_attribute calls are external helpers; any uses of <string.h> inside their implementations are outside this function and thus outside the scope of investigation of this fragment. Therefore there are no direct fragments here that invoke the <string.h> functions that the rule requires to be checked."
