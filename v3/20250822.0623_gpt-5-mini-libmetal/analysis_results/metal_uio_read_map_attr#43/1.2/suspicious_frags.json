  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. Specific checks: \n- No GCC/Clang/other compiler keywords or builtins are present (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, __inline__ with nonstandard semantics, asm, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions). \n- All declarations and constructs are standard C: static function scope, pointer and integer types, array declaration with a macro size, casts, and standard control flow.\n- Standard library functions (snprintf, strtoul) and the NULL macro are used; these are not language extensions. The sysfs_* identifiers are API/library functions (not language extensions). \n- The use of errno and returning negative errno follows a coding convention, not a compiler language extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) in this function."
