  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function metal_linux_irq_notify, the metal_log macro definition, and the related symbol declarations. There are no calls to memcmp, no string comparisons, and no uses of memcmp-like constructs in the shown code. The function only calls write and metal_log; the macro expands to a conditional call to a log handler and does not invoke memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you have other files or additional code that might use memcmp, please provide them for review."
