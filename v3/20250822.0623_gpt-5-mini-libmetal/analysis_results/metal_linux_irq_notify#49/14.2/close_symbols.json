The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- metal_linux_irq_set_enable: This function is a direct caller of metal_linux_irq_notify. To determine MISRA for\u2011loop compliance we must see whether this caller contains any for loops that call metal_linux_irq_notify in their bodies, and whether loop counters or loop control flags used there could be modified by the notify function.\n\n- metal_linux_irq_shutdown: Same reason as above \u2014 it directly calls metal_linux_irq_notify. Its source must be inspected for for\u2011loops that invoke the target and for the identity/types of loop counters/flags.\n\n- metal_sys_finish: Static call graph shows metal_sys_finish calls metal_linux_irq_shutdown. A for\u2011loop in metal_sys_finish could call shutdown (and thus transitively invoke the target) \u2014 behaviour of called functions is included in the for\u2011loop body per the MISRA text, so its code must be checked.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire, metal_mutex_release, metal_mutex_deinit: These are callees of the callers. If any of these are called inside a for\u2011loop in a caller, their behaviours could modify objects (including potential loop counters) or have side effects relevant to the rule. Their implementations are required to be sure they do not alter loop counters/flags used by the caller.\n\n- metal_bitmap_set_bit, metal_bitmap_clear_bit: Same rationale \u2014 these are operations invoked by a caller; if they are invoked inside a for loop that also calls metal_linux_irq_notify, they might modify objects that serve as loop counters or be otherwise relevant to determining well\u2011formedness.\n\n- irq_notify_fd: Global object referenced by the target (used as the file descriptor passed to write). If a caller\u2019s loop counter or control flag is stored in or aliases this global, or if writing to this fd causes observable modifications to objects used by the loop, that would be relevant. At minimum the definition and linkage (global vs local) must be known.\n\n- write: The system call invoked by the target. Even though write normally does not modify caller local variables, its declaration/semantics are needed to document that it does not alter loop counters or other caller objects used in for\u2011loop control.\n\n- metal_log: The target calls metal_log on error. If metal_log can modify caller state (including loop counters or objects used by loop control flags), that would create a MISRA violation when the notify function is invoked from a for\u2011loop. Its definition is needed to confirm absence/presence of such side effects.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The logging severity token/macro; include to fully resolve metal_log usage and to check whether any macros expand to code with side effects (rare, but possible).\n\n- __func__: The implicit function name used in logging; include to ensure no surprising macro redefinition or side effects (normally none, but include for completeness).\n\nIn short: you must inspect the direct callers (metal_linux_irq_set_enable, metal_linux_irq_shutdown) and the call chain above them (e.g., metal_sys_finish), plus the callees they invoke (mutex/bitmap routines) and the globals and external functions used by the target (irq_notify_fd, write, metal_log and related macros). Together these symbols allow checking whether the target, when invoked from within any for\u2011loop in the call chain, could modify loop counters or objects used in loop control and thus violate the MISRA for\u2011loop rule."
