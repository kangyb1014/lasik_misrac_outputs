  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions of the listed symbols because the target function itself mainly invokes macros and uses external types/objects whose definitions may hide compiler extensions. Specifically:\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): Common container_of implementations often use GCC extensions (e.g. typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... })) or other compiler builtins. To decide if an extension is used you must see its exact macro expansion.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): The for-each macro could also be implemented using typeof or other non-standard constructs. Its definition determines whether language extensions are used in the loop construct.\n\n- struct metal_list: The macros operate on this type (node pointers, member access). Its definition is needed to understand how the macros expand and whether any nonstandard fields or constructs are used in those expansions.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: The code reads cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num and uses this struct in metal_container_of. The struct definition (and the name of the member used by container_of) is needed to check how container_of is instantiated and whether any extension-based tricks are used.\n\n- irq_cntrs (list head variable): The list head passed to metal_list_for_each might be a macro or have a nonstandard declaration; its definition is needed to confirm the loop invocation is standard C.\n\n- METAL_IRQ_ANY (macro): Although likely a simple integer constant, its definition must be checked to ensure it does not use compiler-specific extensions or builtins.\n\nProvide these definitions to the next analyst so they can detect any use of compiler-specific language extensions (typeof, statement-expressions, __attribute__ usage in macros, builtin functions, etc.)."
