  "explanation": "All other code in the function and the provided struct definitions use standard C constructs (variable declarations and initialization, arithmetic and relational operations, return statements, and C-style comments). There are no explicit compiler-specific tokens present (no __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __extension__, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), inline assembly, or other known vendor-specific keywords) in the shown fragments. The only items that could hide compiler extensions are the two macros above (metal_list_for_each and metal_container_of); their definitions were not provided, and such iteration/container macros commonly use compiler extensions (e.g. typeof or statement expressions) in some implementations, so they should be investigated. All other lines are standard C and do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
