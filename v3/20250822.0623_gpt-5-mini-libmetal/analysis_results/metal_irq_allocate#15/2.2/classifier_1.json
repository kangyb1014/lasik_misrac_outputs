  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_allocate:\n```c\nstatic int metal_irq_allocate(int irq_base, int irq_num)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\tint irq_tocheck = irq_base, irq_end_tocheck;\n\n\tif (irq_num == 0) {\n\t\treturn METAL_IRQ_ANY;\n\t}\n\tif (irq_tocheck == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\tirq_tocheck = 0;\n\t}\n\tirq_end_tocheck = irq_tocheck + irq_num;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tint cntr_irq_base, cntr_irq_end;\n\n\t\tcntr = metal_container_of(node,\n\t\t\t\t\t  struct metal_irq_controller, node);\n\t\tcntr_irq_base = cntr->irq_base;\n\t\tcntr_irq_end = cntr_irq_base + cntr->irq_num;\n\t\tif (irq_tocheck < cntr_irq_end &&\n\t\t    irq_end_tocheck > cntr_irq_base) {\n\t\t\tif (irq_base != METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\t\t\t/* IRQ has been allocated */\n\t\t\t\treturn METAL_IRQ_ANY;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tirq_tocheck = cntr_irq_end;\n\t\t\tirq_end_tocheck = irq_tocheck + irq_num;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn irq_tocheck;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (irq_tocheck == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\tirq_tocheck = 0;\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment irq_tocheck = 0 is executed when the caller passed irq_base == METAL_IRQ_ANY. irq_tocheck was initialized from irq_base and is later used to compute irq_end_tocheck, drive the search loop and is the function's return value. Removing this assignment would change behaviour for the METAL_IRQ_ANY case (the search would start from METAL_IRQ_ANY instead of 0), so the operation is not dead code."
