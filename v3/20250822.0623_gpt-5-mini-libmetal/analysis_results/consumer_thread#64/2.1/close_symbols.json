  "explanation": "counter: its declaration, type, qualifier (e.g. volatile) and initializer are required to determine whether the test while(!counter) can be evaluated as always true/false at compile time or can be changed by other threads (affects reachability).\nlock: the mutex object type and initialization are needed to understand whether mutex operations can block or have attributes (noreturn) that could make subsequent code unreachable.\nnempty_condv, nfull_condv: the condition-variable objects and their initialization/state are needed to determine whether waiting/signalling can ever unblock the thread (affects reachability of code after the wait).\nmetal_condition_wait: the prototype and attributes (return type, possible noreturn/longjmp semantics or infinite-block guarantees) are needed because if this function is specified to never return the code after the call would be unreachable.\nmetal_mutex_acquire: prototype/attributes are required to know whether this function can fail, block indefinitely, or be declared noreturn (which would affect reachability of subsequent statements).\nmetal_mutex_release: prototype/attributes are required to know whether it can be declared noreturn or have side-effects that affect reachability analysis.\nmetal_condition_signal: prototype/attributes are required to know whether it returns normally and whether it can affect the condition that makes code after the wait reachable.\nproducer_thread: the implementation (or any function that modifies counter) is required to determine whether another thread can change counter and signal the condition variable so that the loop can terminate; without it the wait/loop could be deemed permanently blocking and later code unreachable."
