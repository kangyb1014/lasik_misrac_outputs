  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking MISRA rule about language extensions:\n\n- lock\n  - The object whose type and declaration must be inspected to ensure it does not involve compiler extensions (e.g. anonymous structs/unions, GCC attributes, bit-field extensions, use of typeof in its declaration).\n\n- nempty_condv, nfull_condv\n  - The condition-variable objects: their declarations/types may hide macros, attributes or non\u2011standard constructs (inline assembly, compiler attributes, anonymous members) that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- counter\n  - Its declaration (type, storage class, qualifiers) must be checked for extension usage (e.g. wide integer attributes, non\u2011standard integer types, complex qualifiers).\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (declaration/definition)\n  - The prototype/definition must be inspected to detect compiler extensions used in the function signature or implementation (macros, inline functions with asm, __attribute__, typeof, statement\u2011expressions, GCC builtin extensions).\n\n- metal_condition_wait (declaration/definition)\n  - This call is especially important because the static call graph shows it calls other mutex primitives; its implementation may be a macro or use compiler extensions (e.g. statement\u2011expressions, attributes, inline asm, platform\u2011specific macros). Need the real definition to decide.\n\n- metal_condition_signal (declaration/definition)\n  - Inspect prototype/definition for extension usage (might be a macro wrapper or inline with attributes).\n\n- metal_mutex_release (declaration/definition)\n  - As for acquire: the definition may use extensions; also check for special calling convention or attributes.\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired (declaration/definition)\n  - Called by metal_condition_wait per call graph; its body/prototype must be checked for extensions that propagate into the call chain.\n\n- type: metal_mutex / metal_mutex_t (typedef/struct)\n  - The concrete type (struct/typedef) may contain anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields with non\u2011standard widths, or use compiler extensions; need to inspect type layout and any attached attributes.\n\n- type: metal_condition / metal_cond_t (typedef/struct)\n  - Same rationale as the mutex type: the type definition may use non\u2011standard constructs or macros that are language extensions.\n\n- header(s) that declare the above (e.g. libmetal/metal.h or specific mutex/cond headers)\n  - Macros and inline wrappers are typically in headers. To determine whether any language extension is used you must inspect the headers where the symbols are declared/implemented (macro definitions, inline function bodies, attribute macros, conditional compiler extensions).\n\nIn short: to determine whether consumer_thread uses any compiler language extensions you must examine the declarations and definitions of the called functions, the types of the mutex/condition objects, the global variables used, and the headers/macros that might introduce extensions. These symbols are the minimal set required for that inspection."
