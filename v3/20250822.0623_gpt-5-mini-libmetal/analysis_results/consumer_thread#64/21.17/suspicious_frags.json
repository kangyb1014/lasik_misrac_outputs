  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code for any use of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). None of those functions or any obvious wrapper calls to them appear in the shown consumer_thread implementation or in the body of metal_condition_wait (the metal_condition_wait implementation itself uses atomics and a futex syscall but contains no string.h calls). The remaining potentially relevant sites are calls or macro usages whose implementations are not provided here and therefore could conceal uses of string.h functions: the metal_mutex_* calls (metal_mutex_acquire, metal_mutex_release, metal_mutex_is_acquired), the METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE(lock) macro, and the METAL_CONDITION_INIT-based initializers. Those items are flagged above for investigation because their definitions are not shown and could, in principle, use string.h routines that might access out-of-bounds memory. All other fragments in the provided code do not use string.h functions and thus do not need further investigation for Rule 21.17 based on the given code."
