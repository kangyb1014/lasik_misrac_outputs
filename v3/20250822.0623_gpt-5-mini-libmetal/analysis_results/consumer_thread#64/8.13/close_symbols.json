  "explanation": "For applying the MISRA rule about pointer-to-const you must know the exact pointer types and whether they are required to be modifiable or must match external APIs:\n\n- lock (declaration / its type): need the variable declaration and its type to see what pointer type (&lock) produces and whether the object could be treated through a pointer-to-const. If the mutex object is mutated by the API, it cannot be const.\n\n- nempty_condv (declaration / its type): condition-variable object passed by address to metal_condition_wait; knowing its type and declaration lets you determine whether the callee modifies it (so whether a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate).\n\n- nfull_condv (declaration / its type): same reason as nempty_condv for metal_condition_signal.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire (prototype/signature): the function parameter types (and const qualifiers) tell you whether it accepts a pointer-to-const or a pointer-to-non-const; if the prototype already requires non-const you cannot change call sites.\n\n- metal_mutex_release (prototype/signature): same as metal_mutex_acquire \u2014 needed to know parameter constness and intent.\n\n- metal_condition_wait (prototype/signature): this function takes two pointers in the call. You must know its parameter types/qualifiers (and whether it modifies the objects) to decide if the addresses passed should be to const-qualified types.\n\n- metal_condition_signal (prototype/signature): prototype tells whether the signal function expects a const pointer or modifies the object.\n\n- thread-creation API start-routine type (prototype) \u2014 e.g. pthread_create or platform-specific equivalent: the parameter type of consumer_thread (void *arg) may be constrained by the runtime/thread API. If the thread API requires a function of type void *(*)(void *), you cannot change the parameter to const void * even if the function does not use it. You must inspect the API prototype where consumer_thread is passed to know if its signature must remain non-const.\n\n- types used by the mutex/condition (e.g. metal_mutex_t, metal_condition_t): the underlying type definitions clarify whether the API is intended to mutate the objects (thus requiring non-const pointers) or could accept const-qualified pointers.\n\nThese symbols collectively let you decide whether pointer parameters or pointer-typed objects in consumer_thread could/should be declared const, or whether signatures must remain non-const due to API constraints."
