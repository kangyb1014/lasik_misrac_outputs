  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions of loops or are simple statements: the counter increment/decrement statements (counter++; counter--;) are ordinary assignments, not loop controls; the mutex and condition-variable definitions and initializers (METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE(lock), METAL_CONDITION_INIT) are declarations/macros, not loop controls; metal_condition_wait() contains no loop-controlling expression that is invariant (it performs checks, atomic operations, releases the mutex, blocks, and reacquires the mutex but does not itself contain a controlling loop relevant to Rule 14.3). The rest of the code consists of single-statement function calls and returns, which are not subject to the invariant-controlling-expression restriction in Rule 14.3."
