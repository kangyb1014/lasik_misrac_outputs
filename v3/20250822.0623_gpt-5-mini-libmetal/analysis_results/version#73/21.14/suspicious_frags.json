  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The only string comparisons are performed with strcmp(ver_def, METAL_VER) and strcmp(ver_dyn, metal_ver()), which is the correct function to compare null-terminated strings per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The buffers ver_def and ver_dyn are populated with snprintf using sizeof(buffer) and thus are null-terminated when the size argument is non-zero. METAL_VER is a string literal and metal_ver() returns that pointer, so both operands of strcmp are null-terminated C strings. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate or need investigation under Rule 21.14."
