  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for the MISRA C rule analysis:\n\n- metal_ver (function prototype/definition): You must know the exact return type of metal_ver (e.g. const char * vs char *). If metal_ver returns a non-const char * but the returned buffer is not intended to be modified, MISRA recommends declaring it as const char *. The concrete prototype/definition determines whether the target function is using a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate.\n\n- METAL_VER (macro/object definition): Determine how METAL_VER is defined (string literal, char array, or pointer variable). If it expands to a non-const object or pointer type, that may violate the recommendation that pointers which do not need mutation should be const-qualified. The exact definition is needed to assess const-qualification of the argument passed to strcmp.\n\n- strcmp (declaration/definition): The signature of strcmp used in the build must be known (standard: int strcmp(const char *, const char *)), because if a local/custom strcmp were declared without const on its parameters, that affects whether pointers are treated as const-qualified in this translation unit. Confirming the declaration verifies whether the call sites are compatible with const pointers.\n\n- snprintf (declaration/definition): The prototype of snprintf (standard: int snprintf(char *, size_t, const char *, ...)) must be known to confirm which parameters are const-qualified. In particular, snprintf expects a non-const destination buffer (char *), so ver_def/ver_dyn being non-const is appropriate; this helps decide whether those local buffers could/should be const (they cannot, since they are written). If a nonstandard prototype is in use, it could affect the const-correctness analysis.\n\n(Other callees metal_ver_major/minor/patch return non-pointer types and do not affect pointer const-qualification, so their symbols are not required for this MISRA rule assessment.)"
