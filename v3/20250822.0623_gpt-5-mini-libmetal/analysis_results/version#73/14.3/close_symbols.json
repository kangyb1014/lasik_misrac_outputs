  "explanation": "To decide if any controlling expression in version() is invariant you must know which inputs are constant and which can vary. Each symbol below directly affects whether ver_def or ver_dyn (and thus any potential controlling expression built from them) is invariant:\n\n- METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH\n  - These macros/constants produce the values formatted into ver_def. If they are true compile-time constants (or macros that expand to constant integer literals) then ver_def is constructed from invariant inputs. If they expand to expressions or macros with side-effects, or to calls to functions, ver_def may be non-invariant. Their definitions are needed to classify ver_def as invariant or not.\n\n- METAL_VER\n  - The string (macro or symbol) compared against ver_def via strcmp. You must know whether METAL_VER is a true constant string (invariant) or can vary at runtime to decide if the strcmp result is invariant.\n\n- metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch (function definitions)\n  - These functions produce the values formatted into ver_dyn. You must inspect their implementations to determine whether they always return the same values (making ver_dyn invariant) or can change between calls (making ver_dyn non-invariant). Also needed to detect side-effects or dependence on global/state that affect invariance.\n\n- metal_ver (function definition)\n  - Returns the string compared with ver_dyn. Its implementation determines whether the returned string is invariant (e.g., a static constant) or may change at runtime.\n\n- snprintf (declaration/semantics)\n  - Although a standard library routine, you must assume its normal semantics: it writes formatted data into the provided buffer deterministically from its arguments. Confirming it has no hidden side-effects or macro variants in this project matters to conclude that ver_def/ver_dyn contents depend only on the formatting arguments.\n\n- strcmp (declaration/semantics)\n  - The comparison result is used in the return expression. You need to know that strcmp behaves as the standard pure string comparison (no side-effects) so that invariance of its result depends only on the operand strings.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any controlling expression is invariant you must inspect the definitions of the compile-time macros/constants and the four metal_ver_* functions (and the metal_ver string) to see if the formatted strings and comparisons are constant across calls. The standard functions snprintf and strcmp are included to confirm their expected deterministic, side-effect-free behavior in this codebase."
