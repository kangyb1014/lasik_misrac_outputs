  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, switch, for, while, do-while, conditional ?:) appear in the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions for selection/iteration constructs; since the function version contains no such constructs, there are no candidate fragments to inspect for this rule. The macros and accessor functions (METAL_VER_*, METAL_VER, metal_ver_*) return constant values, but they are only used to build strings and to call strcmp in a return expression \u2014 that return expression is not a controlling expression and therefore is outside the scope of Rule 14.3. Consequently, no suspicious fragments related to Rule 14.3 are present in the supplied code."
