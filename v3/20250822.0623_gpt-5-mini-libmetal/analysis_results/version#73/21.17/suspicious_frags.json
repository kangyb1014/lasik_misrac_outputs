  "explanation": "Only the uses of functions that read or write string objects need investigation for potential out-of-bounds access. The fragments above include the buffer declarations, the two formatted writes that populate those buffers, and the two strcmp calls that read them \u2014 these interactions should be checked to ensure no read past the buffers' bounds. Other code in the submission does not require investigation for Rule 21.17: the macro definitions (METAL_VER and the numeric macros) are compile-time constants and METAL_VER is a null-terminated string literal; the helper functions metal_ver_major/minor/patch simply return those constants; there are no other calls to <string.h> functions in the provided code. Therefore no additional fragments need to be reported."
