  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided code. Reasons: \n- The function version contains a straight-line sequence of statements (two snprintf calls and a return) with no conditional statements, no loops, no gotos, and no labels; every statement is reachable when the function is invoked. There is no code after the return inside the function. \n- The helper functions (metal_ver_major, metal_ver_minor, metal_ver_patch, metal_ver) are defined and invoked; none contain shown unreachable constructs. The macros (METAL_VER_MAJOR, METAL_VER_MINOR, METAL_VER_PATCH, METAL_VER) are constant definitions used by the function; constant equality or inequality does not by itself create unreachable code. \n- There are no preprocessor conditionals, switch/case constructs, or dead labels in the supplied fragments that could produce unreachable branches. \nGiven the supplied code, there are no code fragments that appear to be statically unreachable and therefore no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
