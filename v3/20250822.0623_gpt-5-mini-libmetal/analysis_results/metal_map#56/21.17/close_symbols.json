  "explanation": "You must inspect the following symbols to determine whether metal_map violates the MISRA <string.h> bounds rule because they are the only places in this function that could (directly or indirectly) cause or involve buffer accesses or size arithmetic that might hide use of string.h functions or out\u2011of\u2011bounds behaviour: \n\n- mmap: primary call that returns a memory region \u2014 verify its prototype/implementation to ensure it does not call any string.h functions here and to confirm the semantics of the returned buffer and length parameter. \n- MAP_FAILED: used to detect mmap failure; need its definition to confirm failure check is correct. \n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: mapping protection flags (no direct string impact but relevant to mmap semantics). \n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: flags mutated in the function; confirm the selected mapping behavior (affects whether file-backed mappings and consequent file-size logic matter). \n- ftruncate: called when expanding the file; inspect to ensure it does not internally invoke string.h functions on buffers reachable from this function. \n- fstat: used to get stat.st_size; needed to inspect its prototype/side effects. \n- flock, LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN: file locking calls that gate the fstat/ftruncate sequence \u2014 their implementation could be wrappers that call other functions. \n- errno: used to translate system-call failures to the return value; understand errno semantics and whether error handling could mask or provably hide string function use. \n- off_t and size_t: types of offset/size and reqsize \u2014 required to reason about overflow/underflow in reqsize = offset + size and whether arithmetic could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds length values passed to mmap or ftruncate. \n- struct stat and stat.st_size: used to compare file size with reqsize; needed to reason about the correctness of the size checks and possible truncated/extended file scenarios. \n- result (void **result and the assignment *result = mem): the pointer write is the only memory write in this function \u2014 inspect whether this could alias to a buffer used by any string function, or whether the function ever invokes string functions itself. \n- reqsize (the computed offset + size): the intermediate value is critical to check for overflow that could lead to incorrect ftruncate/mmap length arguments.\n\nRationale: the MISRA rule concerns calls to standard string.h functions that can read/write beyond object bounds. metal_map contains no direct calls to the string.h routines, so to conclude compliance you must (a) confirm none of the called/system functions (mmap, fstat, ftruncate, flock, or their wrappers) invoke any of those string functions in a way that could access buffers provided here, and (b) ensure the arithmetic and size/offset types (off_t/size_t/reqsize/stat.st_size) cannot produce incorrect lengths that would lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses later. The symbols listed are the minimal set needed to perform those checks."
