  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the MISRA rule (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open\n  - Immediate caller of metal_map. To determine whether parameters (especially fd and expand) are constant/invariant at all call sites \u2014 an invariant argument could make a controlling expression inside metal_map effectively constant.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map\n  - Immediate caller of metal_map. Same reason as above: inspect how fd/expand/offset/size are passed to see if any controlling expressions become invariant for all invocations.\n\n- flock\n  - Used to acquire/release a lock and its return value drives the assignment to error (via comparison < 0). The semantics/return values of flock affect whether the subsequent if (!error) tests can ever be invariant.\n\n- fstat\n  - Its return value is assigned to error; whether fstat can always succeed/fail at compile-time (or based on calling context) impacts the invariance of the surrounding if (!error) controlling expressions.\n\n- ftruncate\n  - Called conditionally and its return value affects error. Needed to reason whether error is ever changed, which influences the invariance of later if (!error) checks.\n\n- mmap\n  - Returns mem which is compared with MAP_FAILED. To determine if the controlling expression (mem == MAP_FAILED) can be invariant, we must know mmap behaviour/conditions under which it can return MAP_FAILED.\n\n- errno\n  - Used to compute error when a libc call fails. Its semantics and possible values influence whether computed error and subsequent if (!error) checks could be constant/invariant in a given context.\n\n- MAP_FAILED\n  - Constant used in the controlling expression (mem == MAP_FAILED). Knowing its definition and how mmap returns it is necessary to decide if that comparison can be invariant.\n\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE\n  - Flags used to build prot passed to mmap. While they do not appear directly in a controlling expression, they affect mmap behaviour and thus whether mmap\u2019s result (and the mem==MAP_FAILED test) can be invariant.\n\n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS\n  - Flags that modify mapping behaviour and are assigned to flags; they can change control flow externally (via callers), and could be relevant if a particular constant flags combination at all call sites makes some branch constant. Need to confirm callers do not force flags to an invariant value that affects control expressions.\n\n- LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN\n  - Constants used with flock; their meanings are needed to reason about flock\u2019s effect and whether the flock call can deterministically succeed/fail in the calling contexts.\n\n- off_t, size_t\n  - Types of offset/size/reqsize. Their signedness/width and range are relevant when evaluating the arithmetic and comparisons (reqsize = offset + size and stat.st_size < reqsize) to see if that comparison could be invariant due to type/overflow behavior.\n\n- struct stat (st_size)\n  - The st_size field of struct stat is compared to reqsize. To determine if the comparison stat.st_size < reqsize could be invariant (always true/false) we must know the type/semantics of st_size and how stat is obtained by fstat from the file descriptor passed in by callers.\n\nSummary: Immediate callers (metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_try_map) are required to see if parameters (fd, expand, flags, offset, size) are constant across call sites; the libc/syscall functions (flock, fstat, ftruncate, mmap) plus errno and mapping/locking flag macros are required to reason whether the runtime results that feed the if/else conditions can ever vary. Type definitions (off_t, size_t, struct stat::st_size) are required to reason about the arithmetic/comparison invariance. Together these symbols let an analyst determine whether any controlling expression in metal_map is effectively invariant (and thus a MISRA violation) in the relevant program contexts."
