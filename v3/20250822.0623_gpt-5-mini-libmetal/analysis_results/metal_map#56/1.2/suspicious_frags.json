  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The checked items and reasons:\n\n- No GCC/Clang extensions (no __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels as values, or other known compiler-specific keywords).\n- No inline assembly or pragma directives are present.\n- The declarations inside the else-if block (off_t reqsize = offset + size; struct stat stat;) are standard C (C99 and later allow declarations in blocks) and are not compiler extensions.\n- Use of POSIX APIs and macros (mmap, fstat, ftruncate, flock, MAP_SHARED, MAP_ANONYMOUS, PROT_READ/PROT_WRITE, MAP_FAILED, errno, off_t, size_t, struct stat) are platform/OS APIs and macros, not language/compiler extensions as meant by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (the rule targets compiler language extensions explicitly documented by a compiler vendor).\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that should be reported for investigation under Rule 1.2."
