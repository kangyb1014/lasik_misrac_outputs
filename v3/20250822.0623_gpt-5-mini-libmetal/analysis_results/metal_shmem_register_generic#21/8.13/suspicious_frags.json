  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (comments and the final \"return 0;\" statement) do not involve pointer types or dereferencing and therefore cannot affect whether pointers should be const-qualified under MISRA C Rule 8.13. The selected fragments cover all uses of the shmem pointer and its members in this function and are the only locations that could indicate whether const qualification is appropriate."
