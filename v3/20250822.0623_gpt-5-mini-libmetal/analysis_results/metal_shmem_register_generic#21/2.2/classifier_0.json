Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_register_generic:\n#define metal_assert(cond) metal_sys_assert(cond)\n...\nstruct metal_generic_shmem {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_io_region\tio;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call to metal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0) is an executed runtime check that can change program behaviour (e.g. abort, log, report) when the condition fails. Removing it could change observable behaviour on failure, so it is not dead code. (If, however, metal_sys_assert is implemented as a guaranteed no-op in all builds, then the check would be dead; based on the provided definition it maps to metal_sys_assert, so we cannot assume that.)"
