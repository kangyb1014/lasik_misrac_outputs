The code only checks the pointer for non-NULL, not that the pointed object is null-terminated or within bounds, so a non-terminated or otherwise invalid string will violate Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_register_generic:\nstruct metal_generic_shmem {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_io_region\tio;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\n#define metal_assert(cond) metal_sys_assert(cond)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code calls strlen(shmem->name) after only checking that shmem->name is non-NULL. If the object pointed to by shmem->name is not a null-terminated string (for example a fixed-size buffer filled with non-zero bytes), strlen may scan past the end of that object and perform out-of-bounds reads, which directly violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The short-circuit && only prevents calling strlen on a NULL pointer, it does not prevent strlen from overrunning a non-terminated buffer. To conform, the code must ensure the pointed object is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated (by construction) or use a bounded alternative (e.g., strnlen with a known maximum size) or otherwise validate length prior to calling strlen."
