  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_bus_close:\n```c\nstatic void metal_linux_bus_close(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\tstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) {\n\t\tif (ldrv->sdrv)\n\t\t\tsysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv);\n\t\tldrv->sdrv = NULL;\n\t}\n\n\tsysfs_close_bus(lbus->sbus);\n\tlbus->sbus = NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_bus_close:\n#define for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) for((ldrv)=lbus->drivers;(ldrv)->drv_name;(ldrv)++)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer 'ldrv' serves as the single loop counter used by the for macro: the first clause (ldrv = lbus->drivers) sets it, the second clause ((ldrv)->drv_name) only inspects a member of the loop-counter object and has no persistent side effects, and the third clause ((ldrv)++) modifies only the loop counter. The loop body modifies ldrv->sdrv (a member), not the loop counter itself nor the member used in the condition, so Rule 14.2 is not violated."
