  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_linux_bus_close:\n```c\nstatic void metal_linux_bus_close(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\tstruct linux_bus *lbus = to_linux_bus(bus);\n\tstruct linux_driver *ldrv;\n\n\tfor_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) {\n\t\tif (ldrv->sdrv)\n\t\t\tsysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv);\n\t\tldrv->sdrv = NULL;\n\t}\n\n\tsysfs_close_bus(lbus->sbus);\n\tlbus->sbus = NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_bus_close:\n#define for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) for((ldrv)=lbus->drivers;(ldrv)->drv_name;(ldrv)++)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The for loop is formed by the macro for_each_linux_driver(lbus, ldrv) -> for ((ldrv) = lbus->drivers; (ldrv)->drv_name; (ldrv)++). The second clause uses ldrv->drv_name (uses only the loop counter), the third clause increments only the loop counter. The body calls sysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv) and then sets ldrv->sdrv = NULL; the field sdrv is not referenced in the second or third clause. The loop counter ldrv is not modified in the loop body. Therefore the fragment sysfs_close_driver(ldrv->sdrv) does not introduce a Rule 14.2 violation (unless sysfs_close_driver or other called code modifies drv_name, which would then make the second clause depend on an object modified by the loop body)."
