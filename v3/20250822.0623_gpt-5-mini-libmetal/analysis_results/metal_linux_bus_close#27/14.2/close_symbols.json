Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether the for loop in metal_linux_bus_close is well\u2011formed under the MISRA rule you must know exactly what the for_each_linux_driver construct expands to (its initializer, condition and iteration expressions) so you can identify the loop counter and any other objects used in the three clauses. The for_each_linux_driver macro/expansion is therefore essential.\n\nYou must inspect struct linux_driver because the loop variable is declared as struct linux_driver *ldrv; the struct definition reveals which fields (for example a list linkage node and sdrv) are read or modified in the loop body and whether the body modifies objects that the loop condition or increment depend on. Likewise struct linux_bus is required because the iteration macro likely uses a drivers list head (and the sbus member is touched after the loop); knowing these fields shows whether the loop condition reads any object that the loop body or called functions might modify.\n\nIf for_each_linux_driver uses kernel list helpers, you must see the list iteration macro used (list_for_each_entry or list_for_each_entry_safe) and struct list_head definitions to know whether the iteration relies on list pointers that could be modified by the loop body and whether a \"safe\" variant is used (which affects whether removing or modifying current/next entries in the body is permitted).\n\nBecause MISRA explicitly counts the behaviour of functions called inside the loop body, you need the prototypes/implementations (or authoritative documentation) of sysfs_close_driver and sysfs_close_bus to determine whether those functions modify the loop counter, the list head, the linkage fields, or any other object referenced in the for clause(s). For completeness, include to_linux_bus definition to confirm it is a simple cast/convert and does not introduce side effects affecting loop control.\n\nWith these symbols you can (1) expand the for loop into its three clauses, (2) identify the single loop counter and any other objects used in the condition/increment, and (3) verify that none of those objects are modified by the loop body or by functions called from the body, as required by the MISRA rule."
