  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/expansions of these symbols to determine whether the target function relies on compiler language extensions (which would violate the MISRA check).\n\n- to_linux_bus: could be a macro or inline function that performs a cast or uses container_of/typeof/statement-expression; its definition is needed to see if any extensions are used.\n- for_each_linux_driver: a loop macro used directly in the target; macros often hide GCC extensions (e.g. statement-expr, typeof). Inspect its expansion.\n- list_for_each_entry / list_entry: common list-iteration macros used by for_each_linux_driver. They are known to use typeof() or other GNUisms in many kernels; check their definitions for extensions.\n- container_of: frequently used by to_* and list macros; its implementation often uses typeof or other nonstandard constructs \u2014 must be checked.\n- typeof: include explicitly because many Linux kernel macros use the GCC typeof operator; presence of typeof is a direct language extension that must be reported.\n- struct linux_bus: need the type definition to see if any nonstandard/implementation-defined constructs (flexible array members, bit-field widths that rely on extensions, or attributes) are present in its definition or fields (e.g. sbus) referenced here.\n- struct linux_driver: need the definition to examine the sdrv field and the struct layout for any use of extensions or attributes in its declaration.\n- struct sysfs_driver: the type of sdrv; inspect its declaration for attributes, nested functions, or other extensions.\n- struct list_head: underlying list structure used by the iteration macros; its definition can reveal use of nonstandard constructs (or show the macros are pure standard C).\n- sysfs_close_driver / sysfs_close_bus: function or macro declarations/definitions may carry attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))) or be implemented as macros that use extensions; check these to ensure no extensions are introduced through them.\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro expansions and type/function declarations) is sufficient to determine whether the target function itself uses any compiler language extensions or merely uses constructs that are standard C."
