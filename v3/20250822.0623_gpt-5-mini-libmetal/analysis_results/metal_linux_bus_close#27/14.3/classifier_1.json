  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Typically, for_each_linux_driver is a macro that expands to an iteration like: for (ldrv = first_driver(lbus); ldrv != NULL; ldrv = next_driver(ldrv)) \u2014 the controlling expression (ldrv != NULL or simply ldrv) is not invariant, so Rule 14.3 is not violated. A violation would occur if the macro expanded to a loop with a constant controlling expression (for example: for (...; 0; ...) \u2014 invariant false, which is not permitted; or for (...; 1; ...) when not intended as an infinite loop \u2014 constant true is only allowed as an exception when intentionally creating an infinite loop)."
