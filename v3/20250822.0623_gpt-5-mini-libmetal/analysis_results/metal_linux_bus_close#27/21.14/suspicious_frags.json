  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided code fragments. The function metal_linux_bus_close only performs pointer-to-structure conversion, iteration over drivers, calls to sysfs_close_driver/sysfs_close_bus and assigns NULL to members \u2014 there are no string operations or comparisons. The helper to_linux_bus uses a container_of-style macro and does not perform any string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14 (using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If implementations of sysfs_close_driver or sysfs_close_bus (not provided) are available, those should be inspected separately, but they are outside the supplied code and so are not flagged here."
