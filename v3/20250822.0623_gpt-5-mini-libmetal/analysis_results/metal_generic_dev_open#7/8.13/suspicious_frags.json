  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they already use const where appropriate or are not pointer types that could/should be const-qualified: - dev->name and the parameter dev_name are both const char * (already const-qualified). - The regions member is an array of struct (not a pointer) and so does not relate to pointer const-qualification. - The struct metal_list declaration itself (struct metal_list { ... }) was not flagged; only its pointer fields (next, prev) are relevant and next/prev are included above. - The strcmp usage and the list traversal loop were not flagged because they operate on existing pointers/const data (name strings) and do not themselves introduce non-const pointer types. - Any macro invocations (e.g. metal_list_for_each) were not selected directly; their use sites are covered via the node/next/prev fragments where pointer const-qualification would be relevant."
