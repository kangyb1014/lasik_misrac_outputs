  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_open:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t   struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_device *dev;\n\n\t(void)bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_open:\n#define metal_list_for_each(list, node) for((node)=(list)->next;(node)!=(list);(node)=(node)->next)\n...\n#define metal_container_of(ptr, structure, member) (void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))\n...\nstruct metal_list {\n\tstruct metal_list *next, *prev;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nint metal_generic_dev_sys_open(struct metal_device *dev)\n{\n\t(void)dev;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_sys_open(struct metal_device *dev)\n{\n\t(void)dev;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The function metal_generic_dev_sys_open() is called by metal_generic_dev_open() and its return value (0) affects program flow. The only other statement, (void)dev;, is a no\u2011op used to suppress an unused\u2011parameter warning; removing that cast would not change runtime behaviour but it is not the kind of executed, effective code the rule targets. Therefore the project does not contain dead code in this fragment. If the function were never called (or contained only no\u2011effect operations and no return/side\u2011effects), that would be a Rule 2.2 violation."
