  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The only string comparison shown is the call to strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) which compares null-terminated strings and is not the memcmp function targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Other constructs (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of, metal_generic_dev_sys_open) do not perform memory-buffer comparisons using memcmp, so they do not need investigation for this specific rule. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation under Rule 21.14."
