  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The call strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) can read past the end of either string if either dev->name or dev_name is not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated (or is an invalid pointer). For example, if dev->name is a fixed-size buffer that was filled without writing a terminating '\\0', strcmp will continue reading beyond the buffer boundary producing an out-of-bounds access. This use therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
