  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> function in this function is the strcmp call shown above. No other string.h functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strlen, etc.) are used in this snippet. The other lines perform list traversal, container retrieval, pointer assignment, and return values, and therefore do not involve the string-handling functions or their pointer parameters and are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Any further checks on other functions (e.g. metal_generic_dev_sys_open) are outside this snippet and should be inspected separately if present elsewhere."
