  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_open:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t   struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_device *dev;\n\n\t(void)bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation for typical metal_list_for_each expansion: the macro usually expands to for (node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next) so there is a single loop counter (node), the first clause initializes it, the second clause is a pure test using the loop counter and the list head, and the third clause updates only the loop counter. Therefore, as written this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2, provided that:\n- metal_list_for_each expands in the usual way (single pointer initialized in the first clause, test has no persistent side effects, update modifies only node), and\n- none of the functions called in the loop body (e.g. strcmp or metal_generic_dev_sys_open) or other code in the body modify the objects used in the second or third clause (notably the list head or node->next).\n\nPossible violation scenario: if the macro expansion uses additional objects as loop counters or introduces side effects in the second/third clause, or if metal_generic_dev_sys_open (or any called function) modifies the list head or node linkage (or the loop counter), then the loop would violate Rule 14.2."
