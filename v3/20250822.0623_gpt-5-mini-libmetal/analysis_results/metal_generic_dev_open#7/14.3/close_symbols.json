  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each: This macro expands into the actual loop (for/while) controlling expression. You must see its expansion to determine whether the loop\u2019s controlling expression is invariant (e.g. a constant true/false or an infinite loop).\\n- struct metal_list: The loop control normally compares/advances list pointers (next/prev). The struct definition shows which fields are tested/updated in the controlling expression.\\n- _metal (._common.generic_device_list): The loop iterates over this list head. Its declaration/initialization and any const qualifiers determine whether the head value (used in the controlling expression) is invariant.\\n- metal_container_of: This macro maps node to the enclosing struct. You need its definition to confirm it does not modify the node or loop-control variables (i.e. has no side-effects that would affect the loop condition).\\n- struct metal_device: Shows the layout (node field, name field) so you can confirm which field supplies the list node used by the loop and whether accessing dev->name or dev->node could affect loop control.\\n- strcmp: Include the prototype/definition to ensure it is the standard library function (no surprising compile-time constant replacement) and that the if condition using its result is not an invariant controlling expression."
