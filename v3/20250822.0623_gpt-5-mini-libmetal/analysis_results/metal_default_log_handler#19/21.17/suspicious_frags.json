  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided function. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not directly applicable and there are no code fragments that need investigation under that specific rule.\n\nRelevant string operations in the function have been reviewed and do not require reporting under Rule 21.17:\n- vsnprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), format, args);  // vsnprintf is from <stdio.h>, not <string.h>. The call provides the buffer size (sizeof(msg) == 1024) so it will not write beyond msg and guarantees null-termination when size > 0.\n- level_strs[level] used in fprintf after a bounds check: the code normalizes level to METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY when level is outside the valid range, ensuring the index into level_strs is within 0..METAL_LOG_DEBUG. The level validation occurs before the array access in fprintf. The level_strs array contains string literals (valid null-terminated char pointers).\n- fprintf(stderr, \"%s%s\", level_strs[level], msg);  // fprintf is in <stdio.h>, not <string.h>. The pointers passed are to valid null-terminated strings (string literals and the vsnprintf buffer).\n\nAdditional housekeeping (va_start/va_end) is used correctly.\n\nGiven the absence of string.h function calls and the safe handling of string buffers and array indexing in this fragment, no suspicious fragments are reported for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
