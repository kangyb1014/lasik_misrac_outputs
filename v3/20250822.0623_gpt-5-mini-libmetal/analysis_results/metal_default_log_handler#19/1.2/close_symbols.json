  "explanation": "For deciding whether the function uses any compiler language extensions you must see how the external symbols/macros/types used in the body are defined or what compiler features are enabled:\n\n- DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON (preprocessor macro): controls whether the non-trivial branch is even compiled. Its definition or absence changes whether potentially questionable constructs are present.\n\n- enum metal_log_level (type definition and its enumerators): the code performs comparisons and indexes into level_strs using this type. You must see the enum definition to check for any non\u2011standard enum underlying type or compiler-specific enum extensions (fixed-size enums, explicit underlying types, or non-standard enumerator values).\n\n- METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY and METAL_LOG_DEBUG (enumerator or macro values): used in range checks and indexing; their values and how they are defined (enum vs macro, any non-standard values) affect whether the code relies on implementation-defined behaviour.\n\n- stdarg.h: va_list, va_start, va_end (definitions/macros): varargs macros/types are standard only when provided by the standard header. You need their official definitions to ensure no compiler-specific varargs extensions are being used.\n\n- stdio.h: vsnprintf (prototype and its standard conformance): vsnprintf is standardized in C99 and later; its presence/behaviour (return value semantics, buffer handling) depends on the C library and standard. Verify it is the standard function and not a compiler/library extension.\n\n- stdio.h: fprintf and stderr (prototypes/declarations): same rationale \u2014 ensure these are standard definitions and not compiler/library extensions with non-standard semantics.\n\n- Compiler language standard and enabled compiler extension flags: many constructs that look standard can be implemented as compiler extensions or interact badly with non\u2011standard flags (e.g., non\u2011standard enum behavior, non\u2011standard va_list). To claim no language extensions are used you must know which language standard and which compiler extensions (if any) were in effect when this code is compiled.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions allows the next analyzer to determine whether any referenced constructs are implemented or redefined as compiler-specific extensions, and thus whether the MISRA rule on language extensions is violated."
