  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide if this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings:\n\n1) memcmp\n   - Directly relevant symbol: you must check whether the target function (or any function it calls) invokes memcmp to compare C strings. If memcmp appears in the function body or any reachable implementation (direct or indirect calls), determine whether it is ever used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n2) vsnprintf\n   - The function writes into msg with vsnprintf. Analyze vsnprintf's behaviour (notably: does it guarantee NUL-termination when size>0) to ensure msg is a proper NUL\u2011terminated string before it is used with %s. Also inspect the implementation of vsnprintf in the project/platform to see if it internally calls memcmp in a way that violates the rule (if project policy treats library internals as subject to the same rule).\n\n3) fprintf\n   - The function uses fprintf(stderr, \"%s%s\", ...). Verify whether fprintf (or the platform's stdio implementation) calls memcmp on the provided strings; if so, decide whether that constitutes a violation under your project's interpretation of the MISRA rule. Also confirms that format %s expects NUL-terminated strings.\n\n4) stderr\n   - The stream passed to fprintf; included so an analyzer can find the actual implementation of fprintf used (some platforms supply alternative I/O implementations), which matters if checking indirect uses of memcmp inside I/O code.\n\n5) DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON\n   - Compile\u2011time guard controlling whether the logging code is present. If DEFAULT_LOGGER_ON is not defined, the function compiles to an empty body that does not use any string functions; thus whether memcmp is used depends on the macro value. The analyzer must know this macro's definition/configuration.\n\n6) va_list / va_start / va_end\n   - These control how variable arguments are forwarded to vsnprintf. They are required to check that the formatted output into msg is produced correctly and that no additional string compare occurs in varargs handling; also needed to fully trace where strings originate.\n\n7) enum metal_log_level\n   - The type of level: needed to resolve the numeric values and range of levels in order to reason about index use into level_strs and to confirm no out\u2011of\u2011bounds or unexpected string data are passed to %s (which could affect whether memcmp-like comparisons would be on NUL-terminated data).\n\n8) METAL_LOG_EMERGENCY and METAL_LOG_DEBUG\n   - The specific enum constants used in the bounds check. Knowing their numeric values is required to confirm the if-condition correctly bounds the index and therefore that level_strs[level] is always a valid NUL\u2011terminated string.\n\nNote: The primary check is whether memcmp is used (directly in this function or in any reachable implementation such as platform stdio or printf/vsnprintf). The above symbols let an analyzer determine (a) whether the logging code is present, (b) whether the strings passed to %s are guaranteed NUL\u2011terminated, and (c) whether any called implementation uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
