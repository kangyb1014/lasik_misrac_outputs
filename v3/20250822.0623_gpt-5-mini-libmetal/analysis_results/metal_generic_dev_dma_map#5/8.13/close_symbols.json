  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer parameters can/should be const-qualified you must know the exact types and const-qualification used by fields and callees:\n\n- struct metal_sg: Required to see the types and qualifiers of its members (in particular the type and const-qualification of the virt field and type of len). The function passes sg_in/sg_out elements to memcpy and cache functions, so whether those member pointers are already const (or should become const) depends on this definition.\n\n- prototype of metal_cache_flush: This function is called with sg_out[i].virt. If its parameter accepts a non-const pointer, that may prevent qualifying virt (or sg_out) as const; if it accepts a const pointer, qualifying could be allowed. You need the exact parameter types/qualifiers to judge.\n\n- prototype of metal_cache_invalidate: Same reason as metal_cache_flush \u2014 its parameter types/qualifiers determine whether the virt member (and therefore struct metal_sg pointer usage) can be const.\n\n- prototype of memcpy (from <string.h>): memcpy has signature void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n). To determine if sg_in can be const you must confirm that copying from sg_in to sg_out matches memcpy's const-correctness (i.e., sg_in may be passed as const void * src). Having the prototype ensures this conversion is valid.\n\n- struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: These pointer parameters are cast to void and not used. To conclude they can be const-qualified (or cannot) you should inspect their declarations (in case of special attributes or incomplete types that affect const-qualification in the project)."
