The parameters 'bus' and 'device' are unused and not modified (cast to void) and therefore could be 'const struct metal_bus *bus' and 'const struct metal_device *device'. sg_out must remain non-const because it is written to. Because sg_in (and optionally bus/device) are not const-qualified though they could be, MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the function sg_in is only read (used as memcpy source and for pointer comparison) and never modified, so it should be declared as const struct metal_sg *sg_in to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The unused parameters bus and device are likewise only observed (cast to void) and could be declared as pointers to const as well. The only caveat is an external constraint: if this definition must match a non-const prototype (for example an API or function-pointer type) then changing the parameter constness may be impossible; absent such a constraint the current code violates Rule 8.13."
