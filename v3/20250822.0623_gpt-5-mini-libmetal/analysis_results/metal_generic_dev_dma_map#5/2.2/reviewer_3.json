  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The lines \u201c(void)bus;\u201d and \u201c(void)device;\u201d are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused so the function can keep the required signature (e.g. to match an API) while avoiding \"unused parameter\" diagnostics. Although these statements have no runtime effect, their presence is purposeful: removing them would change the code's static properties (unused-parameter warnings and conformity to other rules/expectations) even if it does not change observable runtime behaviour. In MISRA usage this idiom is used to document an intentional use of the parameter and is not treated as illicit dead code in the sense intended by Rule 2.2. Therefore the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
