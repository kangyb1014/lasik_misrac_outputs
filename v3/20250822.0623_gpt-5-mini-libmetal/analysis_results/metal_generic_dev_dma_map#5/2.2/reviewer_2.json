It is executed at runtime but removing it would not change program behaviour (it only suppresses an unused-parameter warning).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void)device; (and the similar (void)bus;) is the conventional, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA guidance recognises that such explicit use to document an unused parameter is acceptable \u2014 it is not an accidental no\u2011op or forgotten computation. Removing the cast only affects diagnostics/intent, not the runtime behaviour, but the idiom exists precisely to document intent and avoid spurious warnings; it is therefore not treated as the kind of \u201cdead code\u201d that Rule 2.2 targets. In short, this statement is a deliberate annotation of intent and is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
