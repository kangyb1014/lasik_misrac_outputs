  "explanation": "METAL_DMA_DEV_W: needed to know whether the comparison \"dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W\" is against a compile-time constant, an expression with side-effects, or something else (e.g. a macro that could affect invariance). Determining if the controlling expression is invariant requires the actual definition.\n\nstruct metal_sg: required to determine whether members accessed in the loop (sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len) or the pointer types (sg_out, sg_in) carry qualifiers (volatile, const) or unusual semantics that could affect whether the controlling expressions change or have side effects. Also confirms that sg_out != sg_in is a plain pointer comparison.\n\nmetal_cache_flush (prototype): the function signature/definition is needed to check whether calling it could change any of the variables used in controlling expressions (dir, nents_in, sg_out/sg_in or their contents) via side effects, pointer aliasing, or global state\u2014i.e. whether the controlling expression could become non\u2011invariant due to the call.\n\nmetal_cache_invalidate (prototype): same rationale as metal_cache_flush \u2014 we must know whether this call can modify values that affect the loop/if controlling expressions (including via aliasing of sg_out/sg_in contents) so as to decide if the expressions are invariant.\n\nmemcpy (declaration / macro): memcpy is used when sg_out != sg_in. Its declaration (or macro expansion) is needed to ensure it does not have unusual side effects (e.g. implemented as a macro that could modify other symbols) that would affect the invariance analysis (although the standard function does not alter pointer values, the actual project declaration/implementation should be checked)."
