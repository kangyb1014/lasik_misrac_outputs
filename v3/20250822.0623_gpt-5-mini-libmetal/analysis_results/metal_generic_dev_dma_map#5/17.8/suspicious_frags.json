  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Review of each parameter:\n- bus, device: only cast to void, not written.\n- dir: only read in a comparison (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W), not assigned or modified.\n- nents_in: only read for the memcpy size and loop bound, not assigned or modified.\n- sg_in, sg_out: the pointer variables themselves are not reassigned or incremented anywhere (no statements like sg_out = ..., sg_in++, etc.). The code writes to the objects pointed to by sg_out via memcpy and calls cache operations on memory referred to by sg_out[i].virt; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8, only modification of the pointer parameter itself would violate the rule.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that modify function parameters themselves and thus nothing to report for investigation under Rule 17.8."
