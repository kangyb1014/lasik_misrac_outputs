  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no vendor-specific keywords or builtins (for example, __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __int128, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or other known GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions).\n- No inline assembly or #pragma vendor-specific directives are present.\n- The cast-to-void idiom for unused parameters, use of standard types (uint32_t), standard library function memcpy, and sizeof on a struct are all standard C constructs, not extensions.\n- All control structures and declarations shown conform to standard C syntax.\n\nNote: The functions metal_cache_flush and metal_cache_invalidate are called but their declarations are not in this fragment; if their declarations use compiler-specific extensions that would need to be reviewed, but those declarations are outside the provided code and thus not flagged here."
