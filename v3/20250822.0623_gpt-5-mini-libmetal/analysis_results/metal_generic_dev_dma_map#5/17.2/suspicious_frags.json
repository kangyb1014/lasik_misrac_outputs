  "explanation": "The fragments selected are all external function calls present in the provided code; these are the sites where indirect recursion could originate if any of the called functions were to (directly or indirectly) call back into metal_generic_dev_dma_map or metal_generic_dev_dma_unmap. Other parts of the code do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: variable declarations and the (void) parameter casts only suppress unused-parameter warnings and cannot introduce calls; the for loops and return statement are control-flow constructs that do not themselves perform function calls; and the arithmetic/size expression inside memcpy is not a function call. Therefore only the explicit function-call expressions were reported for further inspection."
