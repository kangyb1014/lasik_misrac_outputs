  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In the provided function the only <string.h> call is the memcpy shown above, so it is the sole fragment requiring investigation. Other code lines (the for-loop, metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate calls, casts of unused parameters, return statement, etc.) do not invoke string.h functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and were not included."
