It could be declared as 'const struct metal_list *node' so the pointer would point to a const-qualified type.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In metal_irq_register_controller the iterator variable node is only used to traverse and read the list (comparison against &cntr->node and advancing the iterator via the list macro). It is never used to modify the pointed-at objects, so it can and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type in accordance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (e.g. const struct metal_list *node). Assignments from struct metal_list * (the list pointers) to const struct metal_list * are allowed, and reading members of a const-qualified object is permitted, so changing the declaration is feasible here. The only caveat is if the metal_list_for_each macro or other code relied on node being modifiable (which it does not in this function); if so, the macro could be adapted or casts used with justification. Recommended fix: change the declaration to \"const struct metal_list *node;\" to satisfy Rule 8.13."
