  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_irq_register_controller:\n```c\nint metal_irq_register_controller(struct metal_irq_controller *cntr)\n{\n\tint irq_base;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tif (cntr == NULL) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tif (node == &cntr->node) {\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/*\n\t * Allocate IRQ numbers which are not yet used by any IRQ\n\t * controllers.\n\t */\n\tirq_base = metal_irq_allocate(cntr->irq_base, cntr->irq_num);\n\tif (irq_base == METAL_IRQ_ANY) {\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\t}\n\tcntr->irq_base = irq_base;\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&irq_cntrs, &cntr->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_for_each(&irq_cntrs, node) {\n\t\tif (node == &cntr->node) {\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The metal_list_for_each macro typically expands to something like: for (node = irq_cntrs.next; node != &irq_cntrs; node = node->next) { ... }. In that expansion: the first clause initializes the loop counter (node), the second clause only tests the loop counter against the list head (no persistent side effects and does not use objects modified in the loop body), and the third clause updates only the loop counter. There is only one loop counter and it is not modified inside the loop body (the body only compares node to &cntr->node and returns). Therefore, based on the shown code and typical macro expansion, Rule 14.2 is not violated. Note: if the actual macro expands differently (e.g. uses additional objects as loop counters or introduces side effects), or if the loop body or called functions modify the list head or other objects used in the loop clauses, then a violation could occur."
