  "explanation": "- metal_run_noblock: condition directly calls this function. Any use of memcmp inside it (or functions it calls) could violate the MISRA rule.  \n- metal_run: condition directly calls this function; metal_run also calls metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads per the static call graph, so it and its internals must be inspected for memcmp usage.  \n- metal_finish_threads: condition calls this to wait for threads; memcmp might be used inside it and must be checked.  \n- consumer_thread: passed as a thread entry to metal_run(_noblock); these thread entry functions execute concurrently and could contain memcmp calls that would make condition indirectly violate the rule.  \n- producer_thread: same reason as consumer_thread \u2014 it is passed as a thread entry and must be inspected for memcmp usage.  \n- memcmp: include the standard memcmp symbol itself so the analyzer can detect any direct calls and determine whether they are comparing null-terminated strings (the precise MISRA violation)."
