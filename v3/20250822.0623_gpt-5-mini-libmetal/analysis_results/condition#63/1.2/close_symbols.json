  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the referenced APIs/macros and the thread types to see if they introduce non\u2011standard constructs (attributes, compiler builtins, statement-expressions, typeof, __extension__, non-standard keywords, etc.). For each symbol:\n\n- metal_run_noblock (declaration/definition): The call site may be a macro or an inline/attributed function. Its declaration/definition reveals any compiler-specific attributes (__attribute__, __declspec), use of GCC/clang extensions, or non\u2011standard parameter types.\n\n- metal_run (declaration/definition): metal_run is a callee and (per the static graph) may itself call metal_run_noblock/metal_finish_threads. Its definition can contain macros, attributes, or other extensions that affect the behaviour/ABI used by condition().\n\n- metal_finish_threads (declaration/definition): The target casts tids to (void *) when calling this; its prototype shows the expected parameter type and whether the symbol is a macro or has attributes/extension usage (e.g., variadic macro, statement-expression).\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition) and METAL_LOG_ERROR (macro/constant): metal_log is called with a format string and integer. The logging facility is often implemented with macros or variadic extensions; inspect for variadic macros, GNU extensions, or compiler-specific annotations.\n\n- THREADS (macro/constant): Used to size tids (pthread_t tids[THREADS]) and pass counts to functions. If THREADS is not a compile-time constant (e.g., computed with typeof or expression using extensions) it could produce a VLA or non\u2011standard behaviour. Its definition determines whether a VLA or other extension is used.\n\n- consumer_thread and producer_thread (function declarations/definitions): Their signatures (pointer types, attributes like __attribute__((...))), or if they are macros/inline wrappers, must be checked for non\u2011standard constructs that affect calls in condition().\n\n- pthread_t (typedef / pthread.h declarations): The exact typedef may use implementation-specific types or macros (e.g., opaque struct/typedefs or compiler specific qualifiers). Inspecting pthread_t and included pthread headers helps spot non\u2011standard typedefs or compiler extensions pulled in by thread types.\n\nCollectively, these symbols cover all external declarations/macros/types used directly by condition(). Examining their definitions lets the analyser detect use of compiler-specific extensions (attributes, builtins, non\u2011standard macros, statement\u2011expressions, typeof, inline asm, non\u2011standard storage-class specifiers, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule against language extensions."
