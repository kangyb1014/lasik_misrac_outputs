  "explanation": "metal_run_noblock: need the prototype/definition to see its parameter list (which arguments are pointers vs values) to understand what objects condition passes and whether any pointer/pointer-value is modified by the caller before/after the call. metal_run: same reason as metal_run_noblock; it also calls other helpers (per call graph) so its signature helps determine what condition passes into it. metal_finish_threads: prototype needed to know its parameter types (void * vs typed pointer) to reason about the cast (void *)tids and whether any parameter is being modified by condition. metal_log: prototype only to confirm its parameter types (format/variadic) \u2014 ensures the error-path logging calls in condition do not modify any function parameter. consumer_thread / producer_thread: prototypes (signatures) are needed because condition passes these function pointers into thread-creation helpers; knowing their parameter types clarifies whether condition is constructing/modifying any argument values that would amount to modifying a function parameter. THREADS: macro/constant value is required to understand the size/shape of tids and whether any operations on tids could imply pointer/parameter modification. pthread_t: typedef required to confirm the type of tids[] and how it is passed (array decays to pointer) so we can reason precisely about whether condition modifies a function parameter (it does not). These symbols let the analyst confirm that condition itself does not assign to or otherwise modify any of its own parameter variables (it has none) and to disambiguate pointer/argument usage when inspecting calls it makes."
