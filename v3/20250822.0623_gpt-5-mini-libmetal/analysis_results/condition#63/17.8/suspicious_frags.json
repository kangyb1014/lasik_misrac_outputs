  "explanation": "The function condition has no parameters (signature: static int condition(void)), so there are no function parameters that could be modified within this function \u2014 only local variables (ret, ts_created, tids) are assigned. The code does pass pointers/arrays (tids, &ts_created) to other functions and performs a cast ((void *)tids), but those are argument expressions and do not constitute modification of this function\u2019s parameters. To fully assess Rule 17.8, the bodies of the called functions (metal_run_noblock, metal_run, metal_finish_threads, etc.) would need to be inspected to ensure they do not modify pointer parameters themselves; however, within the shown code there are no violations and therefore no suspicious fragments to report."
