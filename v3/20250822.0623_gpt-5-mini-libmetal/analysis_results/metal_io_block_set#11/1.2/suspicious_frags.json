  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the supplied code. Specifically:\n- There are no identifiers or constructs that are implementation extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __extension__, inline assembly, or other compiler-specific keywords/macros).\n- The atomic usage (atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_seq_cst) is part of standard C11 <stdatomic.h>, not a compiler extension.\n- uintptr_t and CHAR_BIT are standard types/macros (stdint.h / limits.h). ERANGE is the standard errno macro (errno.h).\n- Pointer casts, pointer arithmetic, and dereferencing used here are standard C operations (they may raise alignment or aliasing/UB concerns but are not compiler language extensions).\n\nBecause none of the above extension-specific constructs appear, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions used)."
