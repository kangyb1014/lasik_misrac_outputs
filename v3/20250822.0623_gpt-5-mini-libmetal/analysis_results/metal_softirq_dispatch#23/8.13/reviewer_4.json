If the pointed object is not modified via irq (e.g. metal_irq_handle(irq, ...) only reads the structure), then Rule 8.13 is violated: irq should be declared as a pointer to const (const struct metal_irq *irq). If, however, metal_irq_handle or other code modifies *irq, then the non-const pointer is required and there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is plausible but unproven from the snippet alone. MISRA C:2023 R8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever they do not need to modify the pointed object. In the shown code irq is declared as struct metal_irq *irq and passed to metal_irq_handle(irq,...). Whether this is a violation depends on whether *irq may be modified by metal_irq_handle (or by other code using irq). If metal_irq_handle (or any other called code) modifies the structure, a non-const pointer is required and there is no violation. If metal_irq_handle only reads the structure and the object is never modified via this pointer, then the local pointer could (and per the rule should) be const-qualified and the current code would not follow R8.13.\n\nBecause the snippet does not include the prototype/implementation of metal_irq_handle (nor other potential modifications), one cannot determine definitively that R8.13 is violated. The report therefore is not conclusively correct as presented. To resolve: inspect the prototype/implementation of metal_irq_handle and any other uses of irq to see if the structure is modified. If it is not modified, change the local declaration to const struct metal_irq *irq (and adjust function signatures to accept const if appropriate). If it is modified, keep the current declaration.\n"
