  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. The control flow is straightforward: a for loop iterates from i = 0 to i < metal_softirq_num; the body contains local declarations and a conditional that may or may not be entered at run time. There are no early returns, break/continue statements that skip later code unconditionally, no goto targets that are never reached, no constant false conditions, and no code following an unconditional infinite loop or after a return/goto that would make it unreachable. The conditional uses atomic operations whose outcomes depend on runtime state; therefore the call to metal_irq_handle is reachable when those conditions are met. The local variable declarations (irq, is_pending) are in-scope and used, and do not constitute unreachable code. Given only the shown code and the related controller declaration, there is no evidence of any fragment that can never be executed, so nothing needs investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
