  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp appears in the provided code fragments. The function metal_softirq_set only performs integer comparisons (bounds check on irq), arithmetic (irq -= cntr->irq_base), and an atomic_store; there are no char arrays, strings, or string-comparison operations shown. The additional line shows a macro invocation (METAL_IRQ_CONTROLLER_DECLARE) but its provided form does not include any memcmp or string-comparison usage. Therefore there are no code locations in the shown code that need investigation for Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for null-terminated string comparison). If expansions of omitted macros or other files exist, they would need to be reviewed separately, but based on the supplied code there are no suspicious fragments."
