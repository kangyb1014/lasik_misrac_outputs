  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings:\n\n- metal_softirq_cntr\n  - The global variable whose address is taken in the function. Its initializer or related accessors could call other functions (directly or via constructors/initializers) that use memcmp; inspect it to rule that out.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition including fields irq_base and irq_num)\n  - Needed to verify the types and semantics of irq_base/irq_num and to check for any embedded methods/macros/inline functions or initializers that might call memcmp.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending (array)\n  - The global array whose element is stored into. Its declaration or initializer (or any wrapper definitions) might involve functions or macros that ultimately call memcmp; examine it to ensure no memcmp usage.\n\n- metal_softirq_pending element type (definition; e.g. atomic type used)\n  - atomic_store operates on a specific atomic type. That type (or its accessor macros/functions) could hide string comparisons or calls to memcmp; the element type definition must be checked.\n\n- atomic_store (declaration/implementation/macro)\n  - The function/macro called by the target. If this is a project-specific wrapper (or a macro that expands to other calls), its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not call memcmp (directly or indirectly). If it maps to the C11 stdatomic atomic_store, verify the actual implementation used on this platform.\n\n- memcmp (standard library function)\n  - Include the symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect calls to memcmp from the above symbols. The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings, so identifying any memcmp usage reachable from the target is required.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent determine whether the target function or any functions/data it uses call memcmp (and thus could violate the MISRA rule)."
