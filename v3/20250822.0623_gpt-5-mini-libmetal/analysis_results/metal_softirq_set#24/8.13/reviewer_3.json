Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible \u2014 e.g. 'const struct metal_irq_controller *cntr'. If 'cntr' is not used to modify the pointee anywhere in this function (and there are no other reasons to require a non-const pointer), this is a violation. (If the pointee must be modified elsewhere via this pointer, then making it const is not possible and there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In metal_softirq_set the local pointer cntr is only used to read members (cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num) and is never used to modify the pointee. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer that is only used for read-only access should be declared to point to a const-qualified type. Changing the declaration to\n\n    const struct metal_irq_controller *cntr;\n\nwould satisfy the rule (it is valid in C for a pointer-to-const to point at a non-const object). If there is some other reason the function must modify the controller via cntr (which does not occur here), then making it const would be impossible; but given the shown code, the violation stands and the fix above is appropriate."
