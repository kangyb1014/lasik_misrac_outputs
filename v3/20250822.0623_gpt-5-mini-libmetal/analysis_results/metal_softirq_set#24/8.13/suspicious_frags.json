  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function is 'cntr' which is declared as a non-const pointer to struct metal_irq_controller but is only used to read members (irq_base, irq_num). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, such a pointer should be const-qualified if possible, so the cntr declaration/uses should be investigated. Other fragments are not relevant: atomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1) intentionally writes to the pending array so that pointer cannot be const; 'irq' is an integer value (not a pointer); the remaining lines perform integer comparisons/assignments and do not involve pointer-to-non-const issues."
