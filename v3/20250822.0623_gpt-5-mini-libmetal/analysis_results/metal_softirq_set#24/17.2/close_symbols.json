  "explanation": "atomic_store \u2014 the target calls atomic_store(&metal_softirq_pending[irq], 1). To rule out direct or indirect recursion you must examine the atomic_store definition (it may be a function, an inline, or a macro that expands to calls).\n\n__atomic_store_n / __atomic_store \u2014 common compiler intrinsics that atomic_store macros expand to on many toolchains. If atomic_store expands to a compiler builtin that itself maps to a library call or inline routine, those underlying symbols must be checked for calls back to metal_softirq_set.\n\nmetal_softirq_cntr \u2014 the global controller object whose address is taken and whose fields are read; its definition must be inspected to ensure those field accesses do not involve function calls (e.g., via accessor macros or inline functions) that could lead back to metal_softirq_set.\n\nstruct metal_irq_controller (irq_base, irq_num) \u2014 the structure layout and the two fields used by the function (irq_base and irq_num). Their types/macros could hide function-like behavior (accessor macros/inline functions) or side effects; verify they are plain data.\n\nmetal_softirq_pending \u2014 the array passed to atomic_store. Its element type (e.g., atomic_int, a typedef, or a wrapper) may cause atomic_store to resolve differently or may itself be a macro/inline that invokes functions; inspect its definition to ensure no call chains that reach back to metal_softirq_set.\n\nNote: The aim is to include any function/macro/inline/inline-builtin symbols that the target directly uses or expands to, so the subsequent analysis can determine whether any of those symbols (or what they expand to) call metal_softirq_set either directly or indirectly."
