  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs use standard, conforming C features and do not on their face indicate use of compiler language extensions: calling a function pointer (ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev)); calling a library function (free(ldev)); standard struct and array members (char dev_name[PATH_MAX], struct linux_driver drivers[MAX_DRIVERS], etc.); and ordinary static functions and return statements. These do not require further investigation for compiler-specific language extensions. The macro invocations listed as suspicious should be inspected because their definitions (not shown here) are commonly implemented using compiler-specific extensions (for example __typeof__ / typeof, statement-expression GCC extensions, or other non-standard constructs), so they need to be checked against the compiler documentation for explicit extensions."
