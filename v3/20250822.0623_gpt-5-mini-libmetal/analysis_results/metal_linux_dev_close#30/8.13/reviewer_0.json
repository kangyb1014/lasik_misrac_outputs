If the dev_close callback is declared as void (*dev_close)(struct linux_bus *, struct linux_device *) but does not need to modify the linux_device object, the parameter should be const (const struct linux_device *) and the pointer passed should be const-qualified. In that case this usage violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If dev_close actually modifies or takes ownership of the device object, then a non-const parameter is required and there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct as a blanket violation. MISRA 8.13 is about using const in pointer types where possible \u2014 this is primarily a property of declarations (e.g. the dev_close prototype or the local pointer type), not the mere act of passing a non-const pointer at a call site. Whether a pointer should be const depends on whether the pointee is intended to be modified. In this code the callback is declared to take a non-const struct linux_device * (so modification is permitted), and additionally the function frees ldev after the callback. Because the object is deallocated (and may be modified by the callback), declaring ldev or the callback parameter const would be inappropriate. Thus there is no proven MISRA 8.13 violation here \u2014 only if the dev_close prototype and implementation actually do not modify the device would one consider changing the declaration to take a pointer-to-const."
