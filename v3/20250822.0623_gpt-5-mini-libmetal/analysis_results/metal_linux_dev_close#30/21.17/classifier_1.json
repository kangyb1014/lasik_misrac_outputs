  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment calls metal_list_del(&device->node), which is a linked-list operation and does not invoke any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn). Therefore this call, as shown, does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: if the implementation of metal_list_del internally used any of those string functions incorrectly and caused out-of-bounds accesses, that internal implementation would violate the rule, but no such use is visible in the provided fragment.)"
