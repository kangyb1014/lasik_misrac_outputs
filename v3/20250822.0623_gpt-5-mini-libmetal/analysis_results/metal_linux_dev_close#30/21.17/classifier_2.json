  "scenario": "The fragment is a call through a function pointer (ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev)). It does not itself invoke any of the standard <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. (If the implementation of dev_close internally uses string.h functions unsafely, that would be a violation located inside dev_close, not in this call site.)"
