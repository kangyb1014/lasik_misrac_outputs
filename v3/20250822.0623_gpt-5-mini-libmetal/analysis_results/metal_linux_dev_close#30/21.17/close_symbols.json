  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n- struct linux_device (definition)\n  - Needed to confirm the exact type of ldev, the type and layout of the ldrv member, and to check whether any implicit string handling or buffer pointers are stored in the device structure that could be accessed by dev_close or by metal_linux_dev_close. If ldev contains character buffers or pointers, their use in callees could invoke string.h functions and cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition)\n  - Required because lbus is passed into the dev_close call. The dev_close implementation may access bus members (including character buffers or pointers). Knowing the bus layout lets the analyzer determine whether any string functions invoked on bus fields could access out-of-bounds memory.\n\n- type/definition of ldev->ldrv (e.g. struct linux_driver) including the dev_close function-pointer declaration\n  - The target function calls ldev->ldrv->dev_close. To understand what is being invoked (signature and semantic guarantees) we need the declaration of the driver structure and the dev_close pointer type (parameters, ownership/constness). This lets the analyzer identify which implementations are compatible and whether parameters could lead to string operations on undersized buffers.\n\n- all concrete dev_close implementation functions that can be called via ldev->ldrv->dev_close in the build\n  - Because the rule concerns use of string.h functions anywhere reachable from the target, any dev_close implementation reachable at runtime must be inspected. Include the source (or symbol names) of those functions to check for calls to memcpy/memset/strcpy/strlen/etc. and verify that their arguments cannot produce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- to_linux_device (function or macro) definition\n  - The conversion helper may be more than a simple cast; it could perform pointer arithmetic or return fields that are then used by dev_close. We must confirm it does not itself call string functions or produce derived pointers that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- to_linux_bus (function or macro) definition\n  - Same reason as to_linux_device: ensure it does not use string functions or produce pointers/structures that the dev_close code will misuse.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition) \u2014 to see the node member type\n  - metal_list_del is called on &device->node. The analyzer needs the node field type and layout to determine whether metal_list_del or other code manipulates any character buffers or pointers reachable from device->node that could trigger string.h functions with incorrect bounds.\n\n- metal_list_del (function) definition/implementation\n  - metal_list_del is directly called by the target. If it uses string.h functions internally, it must be checked for potential out-of-bounds accesses. Even if it does not, its behavior might affect memory state (e.g., pointer unlinking) relevant to subsequent code.\n\nNotes\n- The standard free() implementation does not use string.h functions and need not be inspected for this MISRA rule; only non-standard or project functions that might call string.h functions are required.\n- The critical path for the MISRA string-bounds rule is any code reachable from metal_linux_dev_close (including the dev_close target and the helper functions listed). Provide the source or symbol implementations for the dev_close candidates and the listed helpers so the next analyzer can check for use of memcpy/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn/memmove/memcmp and validate argument sizes."
