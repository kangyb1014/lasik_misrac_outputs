  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code fragments. The function metal_linux_dev_close only: calls ldev->ldrv->dev_close(lbus, ldev), removes the device from a list, and frees memory \u2014 none of which invoke memcmp or perform string comparisons. The struct definitions declare char arrays (dev_name, dev_path, cls_path) but include no comparisons. There is no memcmp usage or any apparent comparison of null-terminated strings in the supplied code; therefore no fragments within the given code need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: the implementation of dev_close is not provided here \u2014 if available, its body should be searched for memcmp-based string comparisons, but that code was not part of the supplied fragments.)"
