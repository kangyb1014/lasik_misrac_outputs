  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_linux_probe_driver (or any code it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect all code that could perform such comparisons on the strings manipulated here. Explanations:\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: This function is called three times and takes the bus_name and drv_name arguments. If sysfs_open_driver (or helpers it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (for example to match driver names), that would be a MISRA violation reachable from the target function. Include its declaration and implementation (and any non-static helpers it calls) to check for memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition): The code accesses ldrv->sdrv, ldrv->drv_name and ldrv->mod_name. The analyzer must know the types of these fields (char *, fixed-size arrays, or other) to decide whether any memcmp uses in callees would be comparing null-terminated strings. If drv_name/mod_name are NUL-terminated char arrays/char pointers, memcmp would be a violation when used to compare them.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition): The code uses lbus->bus_name. The analyzer must know whether bus_name is a NUL-terminated string type so any memcmp in callees that compares bus_name can be judged against the MISRA rule.\n\n- metal_log (implementation): metal_log is called for warnings and accepts string arguments; although unlikely, it (or helpers it calls) could contain memcmp misuse. Include its implementation to be certain no forbidden memcmp use is reachable.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING (macro/constant): Include to resolve metal_log call sites and any conditional logging code paths that could call functions that use memcmp (mainly for completeness of call-path analysis).\n\n- snprintf (declaration/implementation used in project): The code calls snprintf to format command strings. If a project-provided wrapper or reimplementation of snprintf exists, it must be inspected for memcmp misuse. The standard library snprintf itself is not typically subject to MISRA project checks, but any project-supplied replacement must be checked.\n\n- system (declaration/implementation used in project): The code calls system(). If the project provides its own implementation or wrapper around system, include it for inspection for any memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nNotes: The primary focus should be sysfs_open_driver and any functions it calls (and the struct definitions for the string fields), because those are the most likely places where name comparisons happen. The standard library functions snprintf/system are listed only to catch any project-local wrappers or reimplementations that might use memcmp inappropriately."
