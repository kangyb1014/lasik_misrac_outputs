  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_linux_probe_driver violates the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified we must know whether assignments in the function actually modify the parameter variables (ldrv, lbus) themselves or only objects they point to. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- struct linux_driver: Required to confirm that sdrv is a member of the object pointed to by the pointer parameter ldrv. If sdrv is a normal struct field, the assignment ldrv->sdrv = ... modifies the object pointed to (allowed), not the parameter pointer (disallowed). The field's declaration (type, name) is needed to interpret that expression correctly.\n\n- struct linux_bus: Required to confirm the layout and fields (e.g. bus_name) of the object pointed to by lbus and to ensure no unusual definitions cause lbus to be modified implicitly. Also checks whether any used member accesses could be implemented with macros that alter the parameter variable.\n\n- sysfs_open_driver (declaration / macro): Required to see its signature and whether it is a function or a macro with side effects. If sysfs_open_driver were a macro that expanded into an expression that assigns to ldrv or lbus, that could violate the rule. The prototype also confirms the return type assigned into ldrv->sdrv.\n\n- sdrv (field or macro): Explicitly check whether sdrv is indeed a struct member name or a macro that might expand to something that modifies the pointer parameter. A macro with the name sdrv could make the apparent member assignment actually affect the parameter variable.\n\n- ldrv, lbus (parameter declarations / potential macros): Confirm that ldrv and lbus are plain parameter names (not defined as macros elsewhere) and to see their parameter types as declared in the translation unit. If either identifier were #defined to something else, apparent uses could modify the parameter variable. Knowing the formal parameter declarations eliminates ambiguity about whether the code modifies the pointer variables themselves.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine if the code only modifies objects pointed to (permitted) or the pointer parameters themselves (prohibited by MISRA). Additional routine prototypes or logging macros (snprintf, system, metal_log, METAL_LOG_WARNING, errno macros) are irrelevant to the specific MISRA rule unless any of them are implemented as macros that alter ldrv/ lbus or sdrv, in which case their macro definitions should also be inspected."
