  "explanation": "For each symbol below I state why its definition/declaration is required to decide if the target function uses any compiler language extensions:\n\n- __func__: __func__ is a predefined identifier in C99 but some compilers provide it as an extension for older standards or implement it in a non\u2011standard way. Need its treatment by the target compiler (predefined vs extension) to determine rule violation.\n\n- snprintf: prototype/definition may be provided as a standard library function or as a compiler/library extension (or a wrapper with attributes). Checking its declaration ensures no nonstandard attributes or compiler-specific builtins are being used.\n\n- system: same as snprintf \u2014 verify it is the standard library function and that its declaration does not use nonstandard compiler extensions/attributes.\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: project/system-specific function \u2014 its declaration could include compiler-specific attributes (e.g., __attribute__, asm labels, calling-convention pragmas) or be a macro that expands to compiler-specific code. Need the declaration/definition to detect such extensions.\n\n- metal_log: logging function/macro \u2014 often implemented as a macro or with printf-like attributes; its definition could use varargs macros, compiler attributes, or other extensions. Inspecting it is required to determine if an extension is used.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: macro/constant used as a logging level. If it's a complex macro it might use compiler extensions (e.g., statement expressions, GCC-specific tokens). Need its definition.\n\n- struct linux_bus: the struct type definition may include compiler-specific extensions (packed, aligned, bitfields with implementation-defined behavior, attribute annotations). The field types (e.g., bus_name) matter to know whether format usage or pointer usage relies on extensions.\n\n- struct linux_driver: same reason \u2014 its definition may contain compiler-specific attributes or nonstandard extensions; needed to check members used by the function.\n\n- linux_driver->sdrv (declaration/type): the type of sdrv (and its declaration) is required to determine whether its use/assignment relies on extensions (e.g., opaque type with extension annotations, nonstandard casts).\n\n- linux_driver->drv_name (declaration/type): used as %s in snprintf/sysfs_open_driver; need to confirm it is a char* or compatible C type and that its declaration doesn't use nonstandard extensions (e.g., flexible array members with compiler-specific behavior).\n\n- linux_driver->mod_name (declaration/type): same rationale as drv_name (used in format strings); check for nonstandard type or macro magic.\n\n- linux_bus->bus_name (declaration/type): used by sysfs_open_driver; ensure its type and declaration are standard and do not hide extensions.\n\n- EOVERFLOW and ENODEV: errno macros/definitions. On some systems these may be provided by nonstandard headers or as compiler-specific values; check their definitions to ensure they are standard macros and not compiler extensions.\n\nCollecting these declarations/definitions (or the headers that provide them) lets the next analyzer determine whether any of the identifiers or their implementations rely on compiler-specific language extensions (attributes, builtins, statement expressions, nonstandard macros, implicit predefined identifiers, calling-convention pragmas, asm labels, etc.)."
