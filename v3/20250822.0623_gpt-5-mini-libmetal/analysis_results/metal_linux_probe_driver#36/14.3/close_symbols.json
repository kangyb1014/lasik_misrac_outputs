  "explanation": "To decide if the controlling expressions in metal_linux_probe_driver (the two occurrences of if (!ldrv->sdrv)) are invariant, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- struct linux_driver: to see the declaration and types of fields used in the condition (sdrv, drv_name, mod_name). Determining whether the controlling expression can change depends on these field types and semantics.\n\n- struct linux_bus: to inspect bus_name used when calling sysfs_open_driver; the call's behavior may depend on this field.\n\n- ldrv->sdrv (field and its type): the controlling expression directly tests this field. Knowing its type (pointer, integer, etc.) and whether it can be modified by calls or external effects is essential to judge invariance.\n\n- ldrv->drv_name, ldrv->mod_name, lbus->bus_name: values passed to sysfs_open_driver and embedded in the modprobe command. Their values determine whether sysfs_open_driver can return non-NULL after attempts, so they affect whether the condition can change.\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: this function is the source of the value assigned to ldrv->sdrv. The analyzer must know its behavior/contract (returning NULL/non-NULL, side effects, thread-safety) to determine if repeated calls can change ldrv->sdrv between the two if tests.\n\n- snprintf: used to build the modprobe command and may return a truncation indicator that triggers an early return. Understanding its behavior is needed to determine whether the subsequent system() call runs and thus whether state that could change the condition is produced.\n\n- system: executes the modprobe command. Its semantics (return value, whether it actually runs commands, possible failures) and its external effects (running modprobe) are critical because system() is the mechanism that may change kernel state so that sysfs_open_driver starts returning non-NULL. If system() never runs or never affects kernel modules in the target environment, the condition might effectively be invariant.\n\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_WARNING: while they do not affect the condition, their presence in error paths may indicate that a failing system() is treated as non-fatal. Knowing whether metal_log has side effects that could alter ldrv->sdrv (normally not) helps rule out hidden state changes.\n\n- modprobe (and sudo modprobe) as external behavior: the intended side effect of the system() calls is to load the kernel module so that sysfs_open_driver can succeed. The analyzer must consider that modprobe is an external/environmental action capable of changing system state between the two condition evaluations; thus it is central to deciding whether the controlling expression is invariant.\n\nThese symbols together allow determination of whether !ldrv->sdrv is a compile-time or run-time invariant in the calling environment, or whether the intervening calls (sysfs_open_driver, system/modprobe) can change the value and therefore make the controlling expression lawful under MISRA C."
