  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition)\n  - The function reads ldrv->drv_name and ldrv->mod_name. To determine whether any string handling (including calls in this function or downstream calls) can read beyond object bounds we must know the types, storage (array vs pointer), and sizes of these fields and whether they are guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition)\n  - The function passes lbus->bus_name to sysfs_open_driver. Its type/size and whether it is a NUL-terminated string affect whether any string functions will access beyond bounds.\n\n- sysfs_open_driver (prototype + implementation)\n  - The function is called with bus_name and drv_name; its implementation may itself call string.h routines (strcpy/strncpy/strncmp/strlen/etc.) using those pointers. To determine compliance with the MISRA <string.h> rule we must inspect sysfs_open_driver to see which string functions it calls and whether their use is bounds-safe.\n\n- snprintf (declaration/semantics)\n  - Although snprintf is in <stdio.h>, it reads drv_name/mod_name to format the command. We must check snprintf return semantics and behavior to confirm that no reads/writes beyond the source string/object bounds occur (e.g., if drv_name/mod_name are not NUL-terminated, snprintf could read past their bounds). Knowing snprintf semantics is necessary to judge safety of the formatted operation.\n\n- code that initializes/populates linux_driver->drv_name and linux_driver->mod_name (e.g. driver registration/creation functions such as metal_linux_register_bus or other places where linux_driver instances are filled)\n  - If the fields are pointers, their allocations and initialization determine buffer sizes and NUL-termination guarantees. If they are arrays, the code that populates them may use string.h functions (strncpy/strcpy/strncat/etc.) and could already violate the MISRA rule. Inspecting the initialization sites is required to decide whether subsequent reads (by snprintf or other callees) are safe.\n\n- system (declaration)\n  - Included to confirm that it only reads the command buffer (it does not modify driver-provided strings) and to rule it out/in as a potential source of string.h usage that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- metal_log (declaration)\n  - The logging call receives __func__ and command. While unlikely, its implementation may call string functions on those inputs; include it to verify it does not perform unsafe string operations that could violate the MISRA rule.\n\nNote: The target function itself does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by the MISRA rule, but it passes pointer fields (drv_name, mod_name, bus_name) to other functions and reads them via snprintf. The listed symbols are those needed to determine whether any string.h functions are used on these objects (directly in this function or transitively) and whether those uses can access beyond the objects' bounds."
