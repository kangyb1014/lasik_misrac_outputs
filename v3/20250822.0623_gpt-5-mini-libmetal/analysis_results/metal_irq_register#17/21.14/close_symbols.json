  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings you must examine not only metal_irq_register itself (which does not call memcmp) but any reachable code that could perform such a comparison. Each symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- metal_irq_get_controller: metal_irq_register calls this function. If it (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp incorrectly on NUL-terminated strings, that would be a violation reachable from the target function.\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller (definition): the function inspects fields of this struct (irq_register, irqs, irq_base). The struct definition reveals the types of these fields (in particular the type of irq_register) so you can find which functions may be called through that pointer and whether any string arguments are involved.\n\n- struct metal_irq (definition): metal_irq_register writes to irq_data->hd and irq_data->arg. Knowing the member types (hd and arg) is required to determine whether arg/hd are character pointers (potential NUL-terminated strings) that could be passed to memcmp later.\n\n- metal_irq_handler (typedef / signature): the handler type shows what arguments are passed to irq handlers (for example whether a char * is passed). If implementations receiving these arguments call memcmp on them, that could be a violation reachable via irq_register or later handler calls.\n\n- implementations of irq_register (all functions assigned to metal_irq_controller->irq_register): the code pointer cntr->irq_register is invoked from metal_irq_register. Any implementation assigned to this pointer must be inspected for memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings. The static pointer call is an indirect call site that could hide a memcmp violation.\n\n- sites that initialize/assign metal_irq_controller->irq_register: to find the concrete functions that can be called through the irq_register pointer, you need to examine where metal_irq_controller instances are created/initialized and which functions are assigned to irq_register. This helps locate all possible callees to inspect for memcmp usage.\n\n- memcmp (standard library function): obviously you must locate uses of memcmp in the codebase and inspect the argument types/contexts to determine whether it is being used to compare NUL-terminated strings (which MISRA forbids).\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyzer determine whether any code reachable from metal_irq_register (direct calls, indirect function-pointer calls, or via data passed into handlers) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
