  "explanation": "For determining whether code within metal_irq_register is dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know which branches and assignments can actually occur and whether stored values are ever used. The listed symbols are required for that reasoning:\n\n- struct metal_irq_controller: Contains the fields tested/used in metal_irq_register (irq_register, irqs, irq_base and possibly size fields). Knowing the exact fields and types is necessary to decide whether cntr->irq_register or cntr->irqs can legitimately be NULL and whether the indexing (irq - irq_base) is valid \u2014 this affects whether branches are reachable and whether the assignment at the end is observable.\n\n- struct metal_irq: Defines members irq_data->hd and irq_data->arg. To decide if the two assignments at the end are dead, you must know how these fields are declared and whether they are later read.\n\n- metal_irq_handler (typedef / prototype): The type of irq_handler determines calling convention and whether storing it (or later invoking it) has observable effects; also needed to match signatures of functions stored in irq_register.\n\n- metal_irq_get_controller (implementation): The first thing metal_irq_register does is call this function. You must know when it can return NULL or which controller instance it returns for a given irq; this determines reachability of the early return (return -EINVAL) and all subsequent code paths.\n\n- IRQ controller initialization/registration code (functions/tables that populate metal_irq_controller instances): Whether cntr->irq_register and cntr->irqs are ever set (and when) depends on controller initialization code. That code determines whether the branches checking for NULL are ever taken and whether the fallback path (writing irq_data) is ever executed, so it is essential to decide dead vs live.\n\n- Functions assigned to metal_irq_controller::irq_register (prototypes/implementations): If irq_register is non-NULL, metal_irq_register delegates to it. You need to know which functions can be assigned here and whether those assignments ever occur; also their observable side effects matter to know if removing the delegated call would change behaviour.\n\n- Global IRQ controller registry / mapping used by metal_irq_get_controller: The mapping (array/table/lookup) that associates irq numbers to controllers is needed to reason about which controller is returned for specific irq values and thus whether the indexing and branches are reachable.\n\n- IRQ dispatcher(s) / interrupt invocation code that reads irq_data->hd and irq_data->arg: To determine whether storing hd/arg is meaningful (live code) you must find code paths that later read and invoke irq_data->hd. If no dispatcher uses these fields, those assignments could be dead.\n\n- irq (caller implementation): metal_irq_register may be dead if it is never called. The static graph lists 'irq' as a caller; you must examine the caller implementation and its reachability (and any callers of 'irq') to decide whether metal_irq_register itself is unreachable or dead.\n\n- metal_irq_unregister: This sibling function likely manipulates the same data structures (irq_data) or handler registrations; analyzing it helps determine whether the handler assignments in metal_irq_register are observed/used and whether removing them would change behaviour.\n\n- _metal_irq_set_enable: It appears in the call graph with metal_irq_get_controller; its implementation may touch the same controller and irq_data structures (enabling/disabling handlers) and thus is relevant to knowing whether the stored hd/arg are consumed.\n\n(You may also need platform start-up / registration entry points that create and wire IRQ controllers if they are split across other symbols; include those as part of the \"initialization/registration\" items above.)"
