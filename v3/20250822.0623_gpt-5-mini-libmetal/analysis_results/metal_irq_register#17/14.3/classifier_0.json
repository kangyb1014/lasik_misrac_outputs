  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression depends on the runtime value of cntr->irqs (cntr is obtained at run time and checked non-NULL earlier), so it is not an invariant. A specific violation scenario would be if cntr->irqs were provably constant at compile time (e.g. a const/global initialized always to NULL or otherwise proven by the compiler to be always true/false), in which case the controlling expression would be invariant \u2014 but that is not the case in the presented code."
