  "explanation": "I examined the provided function for compiler-specific language extensions. The code does not use any of the common compiler extensions that would require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically, it contains no occurrences of: __attribute__ / __declspec, __asm / asm (inline assembly), __extension__, typeof / __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values / &&label, computed goto, case-range labels, or other recognized GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific language constructs. The function uses standard C features only (function definition, pointer arithmetic and array indexing, function-pointer invocation, and macros like -EINVAL which are not language extensions). Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report from this code snippet."
