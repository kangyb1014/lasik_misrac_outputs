  "explanation": "For a MISRA C unreachable-code analysis we must know the semantics and attributes of all external references that can make a branch or statement impossible to reach:\n\n- metal_allocate_memory: Required to know its return-value semantics and attributes (can it ever return non-NULL, can it always return NULL, or is it annotated __noreturn__ / longjmp/exception behavior). If it is __noreturn__ or never returns a non-NULL pointer, one or both subsequent paths may be unreachable.\n\n- metal_free_memory: Required to know whether this call could be annotated __noreturn__ or perform a longjmp/terminate the program; such behavior would make the final \"return 0;\" unreachable.\n\n- metal_log: Required because the call inside the if (!ptr) branch could itself be __noreturn__ (or otherwise abort/longjmp). If metal_log does not return, the subsequent \"return errno;\" would be unreachable.\n\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: The logging level constant is needed to ensure the metal_log call is actually compiled/active or optimized away (e.g., log macro could compile to a no-op depending on level), which affects reachability of the return errno path.\n\n- errno: Required to know whether reading errno has side-effects or is a macro that might expand to something that affects control flow (unlikely but possible), and to determine whether the \"return errno;\" statement is meaningful; combined with metal_log/metal_allocate_memory semantics it helps decide if that return is reachable.\n\nProviding prototypes, attributes, and documentation/implementation details for these symbols will allow determination of whether any statement/branch in alloc() is provably unreachable."
