  "explanation": "I inspected the provided alloc function and the related metal_log macro. There is no use of the standard library function memcmp anywhere in the supplied code fragments, nor any apparent string comparisons implemented via memcmp. The alloc function only calls metal_allocate_memory, metal_log, metal_free_memory and returns errno; the metal_log macro expands to a log handler invocation and does not use memcmp. No other code was provided that could contain memcmp-based string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
