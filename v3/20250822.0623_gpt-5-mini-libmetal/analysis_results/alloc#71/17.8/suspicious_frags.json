  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in the provided function alloc, so there are no places where a function parameter could be modified inside that function. The only identifier that looks like parameters is the macro metal_log(level, fmt, __VA_ARGS__), but macro parameters are not function parameters; in the expansion they are used as rvalues (passed to _metal.common.log_handler) and are not modified by the macro itself. The calls to metal_allocate_memory and metal_free_memory involve no parameters from alloc to be modified. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
