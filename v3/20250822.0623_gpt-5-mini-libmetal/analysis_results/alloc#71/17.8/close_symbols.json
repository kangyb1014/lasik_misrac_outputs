  "explanation": "metal_allocate_memory: need its prototype/signature to know whether it takes size by value or a pointer-to-size (or takes/returns something that could affect a caller parameter). If it took a pointer-to-pointer (or non-standard signature) it might change caller state in ways relevant to the parameter-modification rule.\\nmetal_free_memory: need its prototype/signature to determine whether it takes a pointer by value (normal free) or a pointer-to-pointer (which could modify the caller's pointer parameter if alloc had one). The rule is about modifying function parameters; knowing the signature shows whether a called function could directly modify a parameter passed by alloc.\\nmetal_log: need its prototype to confirm it does not implicitly modify any parameters of alloc (e.g. via unusual side-effects or macro expansion). Also to understand argument types/side-effects relevant to parameter analysis.\\nMETAL_LOG_DEBUG: the logging level macro/constant used by metal_log; include to resolve metal_log invocation during analysis (macro expansion/signature resolution).\\nerrno: need its declaration/definition to know it is a global (or macro) lvalue used as the error return. Confirming errno is not a parameter of alloc is necessary to show alloc does not modify any of its own parameters."
