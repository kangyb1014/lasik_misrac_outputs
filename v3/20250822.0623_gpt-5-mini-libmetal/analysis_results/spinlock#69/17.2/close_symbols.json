  "explanation": "To determine whether spinlock calls itself (directly or indirectly) we must follow the full call chain started by the call to metal_run(\u2026, spinlock_thread, \u2026).  metal_run: required to see whether it calls the thread-function pointer passed to it or otherwise invokes code that can reach back to spinlock.  metal_run_noblock and metal_finish_threads: required because the static call graph shows metal_run delegates to these functions; they must be inspected to see whether they (directly or indirectly) call back into spinlock or call the thread function.  spinlock_thread: the thread entry function passed into metal_run; if this function (or anything it calls) calls spinlock or calls metal_run again, an indirect recursion exists.  transitive callees of spinlock_thread: any functions called (transitively) from spinlock_thread must be examined because recursion can occur through a chain of calls starting in the thread function.  (No other symbols in the provided target function body affect recursion.)"
