  "explanation": "- metal_run (declaration/prototype): You must know the parameter types metal_run expects (in particular the type of the thread-function argument and the argument pointer parameter). If metal_run takes a void *arg (non-const) or a const void *arg affects whether the pointer &lock should be const-qualified. The prototype also shows if any casts occur inside the API.\n- spinlock_thread (prototype and implementation): The called thread function determines whether the object pointed to by the passed pointer is modified. If spinlock_thread accepts a non-const pointer and/or writes through the pointer, then &lock must not be const. If it only reads the object, the parameter (and therefore the pointer passed) could be const-qualified.\n- struct metal_spinlock (type definition): To decide whether the pointer to the lock could be to a const-qualified type you need the actual type layout (members, pointer members, volatile qualifiers). Members that are modified or are pointers to mutable data affect whether the struct (or fields) can be const.\n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT (macro/initializer): The macro can reveal casts or initializations that make the object or its usage require non-const (for example if it expands to an expression involving non-const casts or initializer semantics). Also its type/const qualifications could matter for correctness under MISRA.\n- thread-function typedef used by metal_run (e.g. metal_thread_fn): The exact typedef used by metal_run for the thread callback gives the prototype shape (return type and parameter types). That typedef is required to verify whether the API intended a const-qualified argument pointer.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets an analyst determine whether the pointer passed (&lock) could reasonably be declared pointing-to-const (and whether the API/implementation would need changes) to satisfy the MISRA rule."
