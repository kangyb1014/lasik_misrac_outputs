  "explanation": "To determine whether the spinlock test (and any called code it invokes) contains any for-loops that violate the MISRA rule you must inspect all functions and objects that participate in loop formation or are modified inside loop bodies invoked by spinlock. Explanation per symbol:\n\n- spinlock_thread (function): metal_run launches this as the worker thread routine. Any for loops inside spinlock_thread (or modifications to objects inside it) count as loop bodies for MISRA analysis. You must see its source to check loop counters, side effects, and whether functions called from it modify loop counters or other objects used in the loop condition.\n\n- total (global variable): read in spinlock and almost certainly modified by the worker threads. If total is used as a loop counter or is used/modified in a loop condition (in spinlock_thread or metal_run), that affects clauses 2\u20134; you must examine its declarations/uses.\n\n- spinlock_test_count (global variable): used here in the final check and likely referenced/modified by threads or test loops. If it is used as a loop counter or is modified in a loop body, that must be checked for MISRA compliance.\n\n- struct metal_spinlock (type): the lock object is initialized locally and passed to threads. Its implementation or inline helper macros/functions (lock/unlock) might contain loops or affect loop control; you need the type and its associated inline/atomic operations to see whether loops use or modify lock fields.\n\n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT (macro/initializer): the initializer macro may expand to expressions or compound initializers that could contain side effects; inspect it to ensure it does not violate clause 1/2 (first-clause initialization expressions must be simple initializations without persistent side effects relevant to loop formation).\n\n- metal_run (function) -- definition/prototype: although present in the call graph, you must inspect metal_run's implementation. metal_run typically creates/join threads and may contain for loops (e.g., loop over thread creation/join). Those loops must be checked for proper loop counters, absence of persistent side effects in the condition, only one loop counter, and no modification of the loop counter in the body (including via functions called in the body).\n\n- metal_run_noblock (function) and metal_finish_threads (function): metal_run calls these; they may themselves contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters in metal_run. Their code is necessary because the MISRA rule considers the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body.\n\n- thread primitives used by metal_run (e.g. pthread_create/pthread_join or platform equivalents): metal_run may wrap or call low-level thread APIs inside loops. Inspecting these usages and any loop counters or flags around them is required to ensure the three clauses (initialization, condition without persistent side effects, and update limited to loop counter) and the single loop-counter rule are satisfied.\n\nOnly these symbols are requested because the MISRA for-loop rule applies to any for-loops in spinlock itself (none present) and to all for-loops in functions it calls or that those call. Other symbols in the file (e.g. metal_log, METAL_LOG_DEBUG, EINVAL) do not affect whether a for loop is well-formed and are therefore not needed for this specific MISRA rule check."
