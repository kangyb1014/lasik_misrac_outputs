  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/macros/types it relies on, because extensions are often hidden there. For each symbol:\n\n- struct metal_spinlock: The struct definition can contain compiler extensions (e.g. anonymous/unnamed structs or unions, nonstandard attributes like __attribute__((packed/aligned)), GCC extension bit-field widths, typeof, inline assembly, or other non\u2011standard keywords). You must examine the type to see if any extension is used in its declaration.\n\n- METAL_SPINLOCK_INIT: This macro provides the initializer for the lock variable. It might expand to a compound literal, designated initializer, or use compiler extensions (GNU designated initializers in pre\u2011C99 mode, initializer with __attribute__, use of GCC extension syntax). The macro must be inspected to verify it does not rely on extensions.\n\n- metal_run (declaration/definition): The call to metal_run must be checked for a prototype that might use nonstandard function attributes, nonportable calling conventions, compiler-specific parameter types (e.g. typeof), or varargs/extension attributes. The implementation may also use extensions affecting how it should be called.\n\n- spinlock_thread (declaration/definition): Passed as a function pointer to metal_run. Its signature or definition could use nonstandard parameter lists, attributes, inline asm, or other extensions that would make the call site rely on extensions.\n\n- total: This identifier\u2019s declaration (type and storage) must be checked because it might be defined with extension features (atomic types, __thread, __attribute__, or typedefs using typeof), which would mean the target function indirectly uses extensions.\n\n- spinlock_test_count: Same rationale as for total \u2014 its declaration or type could use extensions that affect correctness or standards conformance.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition or macro): Logging is often implemented with variadic macros or functions; the macro/func declaration may use compiler extensions (variadic macros in pre\u2011C99 compilers, GCC-specific format attributes, __attribute__ annotations, or use of __VA_ARGS__ tricks). You must inspect it for extension usage.\n\n- METAL_LOG_DEBUG: The logging level macro/constant may be defined via nonstandard constructs or macros that use extensions; inspect its definition to be sure.\n\n(Notes: EINVAL is a standard errno macro and need not normally be inspected for compiler extensions. The above list targets symbols whose definitions/macros are the likely places extensions would appear and are therefore necessary for a complete MISRA language\u2011extension check of the spinlock function.)"
