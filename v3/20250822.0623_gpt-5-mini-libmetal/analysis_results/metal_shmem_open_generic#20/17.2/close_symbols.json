  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_shmem_open_generic violates the MISRA rule prohibiting direct or indirect recursion we must examine any functions reachable from it (callees) and any functions that might form a cycle back to it. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- metal_io_region_size: direct callee of metal_shmem_open_generic; we must confirm it does not (directly or indirectly) call back into metal_shmem_open_generic.\n- metal_shmem_open: a caller of metal_shmem_open_generic; its call graph can participate in cycles that include metal_shmem_open_generic, so its callees must be inspected.\n- metal_open: a callee of metal_shmem_open; must be checked to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) metal_shmem_open_generic, which could form an indirect recursion.\n- metal_shmem_try_map: another callee of metal_shmem_open; must be checked for paths that lead back to metal_shmem_open_generic.\n- shmem_child: a caller of metal_shmem_open; included because call chains that involve callers of metal_shmem_open could close a cycle (e.g., shmem_child -> metal_shmem_open -> ... -> metal_shmem_open_generic -> ... -> shmem_child), so its outgoing calls should be examined for possible cycles.\n\nOther identifiers in the target (e.g., strcmp, list macros, container_of) are not required for recursion detection because they are standard library calls/macros that do not affect the function call graph for cycles back to metal_shmem_open_generic."
