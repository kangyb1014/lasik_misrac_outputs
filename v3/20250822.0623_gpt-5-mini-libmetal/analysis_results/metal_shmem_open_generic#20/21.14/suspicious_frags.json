  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in this function. The code uses strcmp(shmem->name, name) to compare strings, which is the intended API for null-terminated string comparison and therefore not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Other fragments are not relevant to this rule: the metal_list_for_each / metal_container_of constructs are list traversal macros, metal_io_region_size and the size comparison involve numeric values (not string comparisons), and the pointer assignment/returns do not perform any string comparison. Consequently there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
