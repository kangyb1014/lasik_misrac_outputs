  "explanation": "To detect any use of compiler language extensions (e.g. GNU typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __extension__, non-standard offsetof implementations, or other non\u2011standard constructs) you must inspect the macros/types referenced by the target function rather than the function body alone: \n\n- metal_container_of (macro or function definition): container_of is frequently implemented using GCC extensions (typeof, statement expressions) or non\u2011standard casts. You must inspect its definition to see if it uses any language extensions.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro definition): iteration macros commonly use typeof or compound statements; its expansion must be checked for extensions.\n\n- _metal (global object and its type definition): the code references _metal.common.generic_shmem_list; the type of _metal determines how that expression is formed. If access relies on unusual compiler extensions or nonstandard initializers, it will appear in the type/definition.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (type definition): the container_of macro and the code access shmem->name and shmem->io; check the struct layout and any macros that define it for extensions (e.g. anonymous structs/unions which may be compiler extensions in some modes).\n\n- struct metal_list (type definition): examine how list nodes are declared and any helper macros for list linkage (may hide extensions).\n\n- metal_io_region_size (prototype/definition): although this is a normal function, its signature or implementation could use extensions; include it to be thorough.\n\n- offsetof (macro definition / stddef.h implementation): container_of implementations commonly rely on offsetof. Some platforms implement offsetof using compiler extensions; verify the standard macro implementation is used.\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro expansions and type definitions) is necessary to determine whether any non\u2011standard language/compiler extensions are used by the target function's dependencies."
