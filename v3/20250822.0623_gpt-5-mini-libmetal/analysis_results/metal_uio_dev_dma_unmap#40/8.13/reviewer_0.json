True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIn metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap the parameter 'struct linux_device *ldev' is not modified (it is only cast to void), so the pointer could and should be declared as 'const struct linux_device *ldev' to indicate no modification. Declaring it non-const therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's observation is technically plausible from the local view of this single function: none of the pointer parameters (including 'struct linux_device *ldev') are dereferenced or modified, so making them point-to-const would express intent and satisfy the \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" guidance.\n\nHowever, MISRA Rule 8.13 is about declaring pointers as pointing to const whenever it is possible to do so consistently with the external contract of the function. In many code bases this function must match a particular callback or API signature (for example a device driver callback) that expects non-const pointers; in that case changing the parameter type to const would violate the required prototype and is not permitted. The provided snippet is a static function, but its signature may be required to match elsewhere (or is left intentionally non-const to match an API). Because no surrounding context or prototype requirements are given, one cannot definitively declare the original code to violate Rule 8.13: if the signature must match an external (non-const) prototype then the current declaration is correct; if the function is internal and the prototype is under the developer's control, then making the pointer const would be preferable and the current code could be considered non-conformant with the spirit of Rule 8.13.\n\nTherefore the agent's claim is incomplete: the parameter could be const in isolation, but without knowing whether the signature must match an external API, you cannot assert a definite MISRA violation."
