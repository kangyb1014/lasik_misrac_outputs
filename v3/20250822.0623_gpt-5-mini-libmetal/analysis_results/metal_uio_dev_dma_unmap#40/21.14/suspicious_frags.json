  "explanation": "The function body contains only (void) casts for each parameter and no other statements. There are no calls to memcmp or any other standard library string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp), no pointer-based or buffer comparisons, and no handling of null-terminated strings. Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) cannot be violated in this code fragment. If memcmp or any string comparison is introduced later, those new occurrences should be re-evaluated."
