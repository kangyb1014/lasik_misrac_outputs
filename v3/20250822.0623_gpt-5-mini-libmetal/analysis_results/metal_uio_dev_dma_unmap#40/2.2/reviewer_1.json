Those casts are no-op operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. In other words, the entire function body is dead code (an empty stub); either implement the required behavior or remove the unused parameters and/or the function to comply with the rule.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_uio_dev_dma_unmap:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The (void) parameter-cast statements in the function body are no-op operations that are executed when the function is called but have no effect on program state. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), those statements qualify as dead code. (Only the case where their presence is relied on for timing would change that conclusion, but there is no indication of such a requirement here.) To avoid the issue either implement the required behavior, remove the unused parameters from the function (omit the parameter names in the definition), or otherwise document the intentionally empty implementation in a way acceptable to your coding standard."
