  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The five statements of the form (void) param; are expression-statements that have no side effects and perform no observable action at run-time. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. Removing those casts (or replacing them with an empty function body) does not change program behaviour, so they are dead code and trigger a Rule 2.2 violation. Note: the intent of those lines is to suppress \"unused parameter\" diagnostics, but that intent does not make them non-dead under the Rule. To address this while complying with MISRA, use an approved method for indicating intentionally unused parameters (for example a standardized UNUSED_PARAM macro implemented as a preprocessor annotation or compiler-specific attribute), or otherwise restructure the code so that no executed no-op statements remain in the function body."
