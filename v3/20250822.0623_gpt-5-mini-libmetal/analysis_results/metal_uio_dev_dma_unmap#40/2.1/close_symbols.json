  "explanation": "To decide whether this static function is unreachable (dead code) you must know all possible ways it can be invoked. Direct callers show explicit calls. Any place that takes its address (function\u2011pointer variables, arrays, struct initializers) or inserts it into driver ops/tables can make it reachable indirectly. Because the function has internal linkage (static), reachability is limited to its translation unit, so the entire C file must be inspected for macroized/conditional uses or address\u2011taking. Finally, build/linker or registration metadata can indicate uses not visible as normal calls (e.g. exported/registered callbacks), so those symbols must be checked as well."
