First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

The loop uses len as the loop counter (tested in the second clause and decremented in the third), but the third clause also updates dest and ptr (dest += sizeof(int), ptr += sizeof(int)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter (and only one loop counter shall be present).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires a for statement to have at most one loop counter and for the third clause to modify only that loop counter. In the code the for loops use len as the loop counter (tested in the second clause) but the third clauses also modify dest and ptr (e.g. dest += sizeof(int), ptr += sizeof(int), len -= sizeof(int) and later dest++, ptr++, len--). That means more than one object is modified in the iteration-expression and the third clause does not modify only the loop counter \u2014 a clear violation of Rule 14.2."
