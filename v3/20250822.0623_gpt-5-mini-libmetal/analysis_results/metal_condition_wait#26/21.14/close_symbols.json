  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must examine every symbol that could itself call memcmp or expand to code that calls memcmp or that supplies arguments to such calls. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: This function is called directly by metal_condition_wait. If it (or any functions it calls) uses memcmp to compare strings, that would be a violation reachable from the target function. Provide its implementation to inspect for memcmp usage and argument types.\n\n- metal_mutex_release: Direct callee; may contain memcmp calls or call other helpers that do. Need its body to ensure no memcmp-on-NT-strings is used during the release path taken by metal_condition_wait.\n\n- metal_mutex_acquire: Direct callee; same reasoning as release \u2014 inspect for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct metal_condition (definition): metal_condition_wait accesses cv->mptr, cv->wakeups, cv->waiters. Knowing the exact types of these members (and any embedded character arrays or pointers) is necessary to determine whether any memcmp uses (in this function or callees) would be comparing null-terminated strings vs. raw buffers.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (definition/typedef): The concrete type of the mutex object may reveal fields (e.g., name pointers) that mutex helper functions might compare with memcmp/strcmp. Needed to understand what data mutex helpers could be operating on.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong, atomic_load, atomic_fetch_add, atomic_fetch_sub (macro/definitions): These are used in the function and may be implemented as macros or inline helpers. Inspect them to ensure they do not expand into or call memcmp (very unlikely, but must be confirmed). Also to verify they do not perform string comparisons implicitly on the involved members.\n\n- syscall (wrapper/implementation) and FUTEX_WAIT / SYS_futex definitions: metal_condition_wait calls syscall; if the syscall wrapper in this environment were to call memcmp (unlikely) or perform string comparisons, that could be relevant. Include the syscall wrapper and the futex-related macros so the analyzer can rule out memcmp use in that path.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule targets calls to the standard memcmp comparing null-terminated strings. The most important artifacts to inspect are the direct callees' implementations (metal_mutex_*) and the data type definitions (metal_condition, metal_mutex_t) so any memcmp calls and their argument types can be checked. The atomic primitives and syscall wrapper are included to be exhaustive \u2014 they are unlikely to use memcmp, but their definitions must be checked to definitively rule them out."
