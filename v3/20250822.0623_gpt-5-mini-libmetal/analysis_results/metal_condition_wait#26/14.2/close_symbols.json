Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: must inspect its body to see if it contains any for-loop(s) (their loop counters and side-effects). MISRA\u2019s rule counts the behavior of functions called within a for loop as part of the loop body, so any loop inside this function could affect compliance when it is called. \n- metal_mutex_release: same reason \u2014 its implementation may contain for-loops or modify objects that could interact with loop counters or loop-control flags. \n- metal_mutex_acquire: same reason \u2014 must check for internal for-loops or modifications of objects that would be relevant to the for-loop well-formedness rule. \n- struct metal_condition: the types and declarations of mptr, wakeups and waiters are needed to understand whether atomic operations operate on atomic types, pointers, or other objects; knowing their types is required to determine whether called functions or atomic helpers could modify loop counters or shared objects referenced by a for loop. \n- metal_mutex_t: the mutex type definition may reveal inlined operations or attributes that affect whether called mutex functions contain for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA rule analysis. \n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong: this atomic primitive may be a macro, inline function or builtin that could contain loops (e.g. retry loops) or other side effects \u2014 its implementation must be inspected for for-loops and for any modifications of objects that could interact with loop counters. \n- atomic_load: inspect implementation to ensure it does not contain for-loops or persistent side effects. \n- atomic_fetch_add: may be an inline routine or macro; check for loops or modifications of objects used as loop counters. \n- atomic_fetch_sub: same as fetch_add. \n- stdatomic.h / atomic type definitions: the actual atomic type definitions and any wrappers/inlines determine whether atomic operations expand into code containing for-loops or other stateful behavior. \n- syscall (libc wrapper): the wrapper implementation could contain loops; to be conservative, inspect it if analysis must treat called-library behavior as part of loop body. \n- SYS_futex: constant definition required to trace the syscall path / implementation if needed (kernel wrapper in libc may have code paths with loops). \n- FUTEX_WAIT: same as SYS_futex \u2014 definition/usage may influence whether any user-space helper contains loops. \n- errno macros (EINVAL): the macro value itself is not a source of for-loops but is included to fully understand return-value usage and to ensure no macros expand into complex code with loops.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any for-loop well-formedness violations exist that involve called behavior, you must examine the implementations (or macro expansions) of every function and primitive invoked by metal_condition_wait and the definitions of the data types it manipulates. The list above is the minimal set of symbols whose definitions/implementations must be available to perform that analysis."
