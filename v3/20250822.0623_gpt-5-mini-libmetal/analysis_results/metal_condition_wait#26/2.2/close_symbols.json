  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for a MISRA\u2011dead\u2011code analysis of metal_condition_wait:\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong: The function relies on its return and side\u2011effects on tmpmptr/cv->mptr. To know whether the compare/exchange and the conditional branch are semantically necessary (removing it changes behavior), we must know its precise semantics and usage by other code.\n\n- atomic_load: The loaded value of cv->wakeups (v) is passed to futex; understanding whether that load (and the value used) is semantically necessary requires the exact semantics of atomic_load here.\n\n- atomic_fetch_add / atomic_fetch_sub: These update cv->waiters. To determine whether these increments/decrements are dead (i.e., could be removed without changing observable behavior) we must see how waiters is read/used by other code (e.g., signaling path) and the exact atomic semantics.\n\n- syscall: The futex wait is performed via syscall(SYS_futex,...). The call is a visible side\u2011effect (blocks the thread, interacts with kernel). To decide if the syscall (and the surrounding load/store) is removable, the syscall implementation/semantics must be known.\n\n- SYS_futex, FUTEX_WAIT, FUTEX_WAKE: Macros/constants used to invoke the futex system call. FUTEX_WAIT semantics (wait only if value equals expected) determine whether the ordering and the prior atomic_load are necessary; FUTEX_WAKE is typically used by the signal path, so its semantics are needed to reason about wakeup coordination.\n\n- EINVAL: The function returns -EINVAL on several checks. To judge whether those return paths and the checks are relevant (executable in practice) we need the error value symbol (mainly for completeness of observable behavior) and to confirm callers rely on these error codes.\n\n- struct metal_condition (definition: mptr, wakeups, waiters): The function reads/writes cv->mptr, wakeups, waiters. To determine whether any of these accesses are dead, we must see the structure layout, types (atomic types or plain), and usages elsewhere.\n\n- metal_condition initialization routines (where mptr/wakeups/waiters are initialized): If any of the operations in metal_condition_wait are only meaningful because of initialization state (for example, mptr set once at init), we need the init code to decide whether certain branches or stores are redundant.\n\n- metal_condition_signal: The signalling path (likely increments wakeups and issues FUTEX_WAKE) is the complementary behavior. To judge whether waiters/wakeups updates and the futex wait are necessary (or dead), we must inspect the signal implementation and how it uses the same fields.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (type definition): The function manipulates a metal_mutex_t via is_acquired/release/acquire. Understanding whether the release/acquire calls (and the precondition check metal_mutex_is_acquired) are semantically necessary requires the mutex type and its invariants.\n\n- semantics/implementation of C11 atomics (memory ordering and visible side\u2011effects): MISRA dead\u2011code analysis must consider observable behavior including inter\u2011thread interactions. The exact ordering and atomic semantics (e.g., whether these atomics are lock\u2011free, memory orders used by the wrappers) affect whether removing an atomic operation would change program behaviour.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any executed operation in metal_condition_wait is dead (removable without changing behavior) you must examine the concurrent interactions (signal path, initialization, kernel futex behaviour), the atomic operation semantics, and the mutex/type invariants \u2014 the symbols above provide that necessary context."
