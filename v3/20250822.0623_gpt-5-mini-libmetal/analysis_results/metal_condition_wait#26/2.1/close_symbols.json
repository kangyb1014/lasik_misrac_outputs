  "explanation": "- struct metal_condition (full definition): Needed to know the exact types of cv->mptr, cv->wakeups and cv->waiters. The control-flow reasoning about the compare-exchange and subsequent checks depends on cv->mptr being an atomic integer type of the same width as uintptr_t and on the types passed to atomic_load/fetch and syscall.\n\n- atomic_compare_exchange_strong (declaration + semantics used in this build/ABI): Crucial to determine reachability of the inner branch. MISRA unreachable-code analysis must use the precise contract: on success it returns true and updates the atomic, on failure it returns false and stores the current atomic value into the expected parameter. That contract implies that when the function returns false the updated expected cannot equal the desired value, which is what makes the tmpmptr == mptr case infeasible. You must inspect the actual implementation/definition used by the project to ensure no nonstandard semantics are present.\n\n- atomic_load / atomic_fetch_add / atomic_fetch_sub (declarations + semantics): Required to ensure these operations do not have unexpected side effects that could affect control flow (e.g. modify tmpmptr or cv->mptr in an implementation-defined way). For unreachable-code proof we need to know they behave as standard atomic read/modify operations.\n\n- atomic type used for cv->mptr (e.g. atomic_uintptr_t) and its typedef/declaration: To confirm representation/aliasing and that the compare-exchange operates on the same value domain as tmpmptr/mptr casts. If the atomic type or its compare-exchange wrapper has nonstandard behavior the reachability argument may fail.\n\n- metal_mutex_t (typedef/definition): To ensure that casting m to uintptr_t and comparing/storing mptr is well-defined and that no implicit conversions alter control flow assumptions.\n\n- EINVAL (errno macro/definition): Present in return statements; include to confirm it is a compile-time constant and does not alter control flow or produce side effects relevant to reachability.\n\n- syscall and SYS_futex, FUTEX_WAIT (declarations/constants): Present in the code path after the compare-exchange. While the futex syscall itself does not affect the static reachability question for the compare-exchange branch, include these symbols to allow a full control\u2011flow analysis of the function (to show the later code is reachable and not guarded by any additional conditions).\n\nIn short: the key items for proving unreachable code are the exact definition of cv->mptr (atomic type) and the precise semantics/implementation of atomic_compare_exchange_strong; the other atomic primitives, type definitions and constants are needed to complete a sound control-flow analysis in the project context."
