  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment: the conditional return is reachable only when cv or m is NULL or the mutex is not acquired; when the condition is false execution continues to the following statements, so there is no unreachable code. A Rule 2.1 violation would occur only if the condition were a compile-time constant that always evaluates true (for example the expression reduced by macros or constant definitions to 'if (1) return ...'), making the rest of the function unreachable."
