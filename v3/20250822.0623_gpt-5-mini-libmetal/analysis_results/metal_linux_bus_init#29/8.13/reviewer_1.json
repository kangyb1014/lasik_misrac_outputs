True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer lbus is declared as struct linux_bus *lbus but in metal_linux_bus_init it is only used to iterate and read the bus entries (for_each_linux_bus tests (lbus)->bus_name and passes lbus to metal_linux_probe_bus). If the pointed-to linux_bus objects are not modified by this function, lbus should be declared as pointer to const: const struct linux_bus *lbus. Leaving it non-const when it could be const is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If metal_linux_probe_bus requires a non-const pointer, the proper fix is to update that API to take a pointer-to-const or to justify the non-const use.)\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nmetal_linux_bus_init: enter\niter 0: lbus=0x7f83ff9c2b60 bus_name=(null)\niter 0: metal_linux_probe_bus returned 0\niter 1: lbus=0x7f83ff9c3dc8 bus_name=(null)\niter 1: metal_linux_probe_bus returned 0\nmetal_linux_bus_init: exit valid=2 ret=0\nmetal_linux_bus_init: enter\niter 0: lbus=0x55cd575f5260 bus_name=(null)\niter 0: metal_linux_probe_bus returned 0\niter 1: lbus=0x55cd575f64c8 bus_name=(null)\niter 1: metal_linux_probe_bus returned 0\nmetal_linux_bus_init: exit valid=2 ret=0\n\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_linux_bus_init:\nstruct linux_bus {\n\tstruct metal_bus\tbus;\n\tconst char\t\t*bus_name;\n\tstruct linux_driver\tdrivers[MAX_DRIVERS];\n\tstruct sysfs_bus\t*sbus;\n}\n...\n#define for_each_linux_bus(lbus) for((lbus)=linux_bus;(lbus)->bus_name;(lbus)++)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not definitively correct as stated. The rule requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, but whether that \"possible\" condition holds here depends on what metal_linux_probe_bus expects and whether it (or any other called code) modifies the pointed-to linux_bus objects. Declaring lbus as const struct linux_bus * is syntactically fine for the loop (the macro assigns and increments the pointer and reads ->bus_name), and would satisfy MISRA 8.13 if nothing called with lbus requires a mutable pointer. However, if metal_linux_probe_bus has a prototype taking struct linux_bus * (non-const) or otherwise modifies the bus objects, then lbus must remain non-const and no violation exists. The agent A did not provide the prototype/implementation of metal_linux_probe_bus or any evidence that the pointed-to objects are never modified, so you cannot conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. Recommended action: inspect the signature/behavior of metal_linux_probe_bus (and any other callees) \u2014 if they do not modify the linux_bus objects, change the local variable to const struct linux_bus * or update that API to accept a const pointer (or provide a documented justification for the non-const use)."
