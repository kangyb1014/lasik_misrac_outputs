  "explanation": "No occurrences of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code fragment. The snippet only declares a pointer (lbus), iterates with a macro (for_each_linux_bus) and calls metal_linux_probe_bus; there are no buffer or string operations, no pointer arithmetic or raw memory accesses within this snippet that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. Note: potential issues inside the macro for_each_linux_bus or the function metal_linux_probe_bus are outside the supplied code and therefore are not reported here."
