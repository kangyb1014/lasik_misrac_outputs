  "explanation": "1) for_each_linux_bus (macro definition/expansion): The loop controlling expression is the macro expansion. To judge whether the controlling expression is invariant we must see the exact expression produced by this macro (the controlling test and the iterator update). If the macro expands to a constant test or to an expression that never changes, the MISRA rule could be violated.  \n\n2) underlying list macros used by for_each_linux_bus (list_for_each_entry, list_for_each, list_entry, struct list_head): The for_each_linux_bus macro typically expands to other list-iteration macros. Their definitions determine how the iterator is advanced and what the controlling expression actually evaluates. Without these, you cannot determine whether the controlling expression depends on a variable that changes.  \n\n3) the list head symbol used by the macro (e.g. linux_bus_list or equivalent): The macro will iterate over a specific list head. You need the definition/declaration of that list head to know whether it is a mutable object that the loop condition depends on or if it is an invariant (e.g. a constant/NULL).  \n\n4) struct linux_bus (definition): The macro and list iteration macros usually access a field/member inside struct linux_bus (list node). Knowing the struct layout shows which field is used for linkage and whether the iteration expression refers to a mutable member of lbus.  \n\n5) metal_linux_probe_bus (function definition and any functions it calls that may mutate the bus list): The loop body calls this function. If that function (or functions it calls) can modify the list head, remove/add elements, or change the iterator state, the controlling expression will change during iteration and thus is not invariant. To determine whether the controlling expression remains invariant you must inspect the callee(s) for side effects on the iteration data structures."
