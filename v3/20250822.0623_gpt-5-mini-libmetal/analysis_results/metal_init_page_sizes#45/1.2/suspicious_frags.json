  "explanation": "The rest of the function uses standard C constructs, library calls and preprocessor conditionals (getpagesize, gethugepagesize, qsort, macros like MAP_HUGETLB/MAP_HUGE_SHIFT, #ifdef/#endif), which are not compiler language extensions. The only fragments that may rely on language features that some compilers treat as extensions (and thus should be investigated) are: the local array declared with a non-constant bound (VLA behavior tied to 'const int max_sizes = ...' and 'long sizes[max_sizes];') and the block-local declaration 'int i, count;' (declaration after executable statements in a function block which requires C99 or later). These items can be treated as standard in C99/C11 (where supported), but on some compilers or in certain language modes they are considered extensions or unsupported and therefore need verification against the compiler documentation and project language mode."
