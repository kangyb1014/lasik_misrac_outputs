  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: needed to see the types of fields accessed (dev->bus) and whether members of the device are modified by this function or expected to be immutable; that affects whether the 'dev' parameter could be const.\n- struct metal_bus: needed to determine the exact type of dev->bus (pointer vs embedded), and the mutability of the bus object accessed here; this influences whether dev->bus access requires dev to be non-const.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (the type of dev->bus->ops): required to see how ops is declared (pointer vs value) and to find the dev_dma_map member type; this affects whether calling through ops could mutate the pointed-to data and thus whether pointers should be const.\n- prototype of dev_dma_map (the function-pointer signature used in ops): essential to determine whether the callee expects const-qualified pointers (e.g., whether it declares parameters as const struct metal_sg * or const struct metal_device *). If the callee mutates its pointer parameters, the caller cannot make them const; if it takes const pointers, the caller could/should propagate const.\n- struct metal_sg: needed to know the semantics and fields of scatter-gather entries; to decide if sg_in is only read and could be const, and whether sg_out must be writable. Knowing the layout also shows if metal_dma_map or other code may modify sg contents directly.\n\n(These symbols let an analyzer determine whether the pointer parameters passed into metal_dma_map could legally be const-qualified given how they are used here and by the called dev_dma_map.)"
