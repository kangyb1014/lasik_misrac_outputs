  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not supported. Rule 8.13 recommends using pointers-to-const where it is possible for the pointer to never be used to modify the pointed object. Judging from the snippets, you cannot conclude that 'struct metal_bus *bus' could be made const:\n- The metal_bus structure contains mutable members (e.g. devices list) which are almost certainly modified by bus management code, so a device's back-reference to its bus is typically used for mutation elsewhere.\n- In metal_dma_map the bus pointer is passed into dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map; that operation likely has a non-const prototype and may mutate the bus, so you cannot safely change the member type without changing many call-sites and semantics.\n- The fact that metal_dma_map only reads dev->bus in this one place does not prove the pointer is never used to modify the bus in other code; MISRA 8.13 applies globally to whether the pointer can be const-qualified, not to a single read-only usage.\nTherefore, based on the provided code and types, the report that this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect (not enough evidence that the member could be const-qualified)."
