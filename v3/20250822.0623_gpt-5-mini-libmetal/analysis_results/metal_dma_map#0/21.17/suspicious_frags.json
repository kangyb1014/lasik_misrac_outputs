  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The only pointer dereferences (dev, sg_in, sg_out, dev->bus, dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map) are checked for NULL before use (dev, sg_in, sg_out) or checked for NULL (dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map) prior to invocation. There are no string operations, no buffer copies, and no size/length computations in this fragment that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via the standard string functions. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
