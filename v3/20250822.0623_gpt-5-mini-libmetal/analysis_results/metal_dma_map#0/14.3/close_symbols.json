  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in metal_dma_map is invariant (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know the declarations and qualifiers of all symbols that appear in those expressions and any concurrency/memory-order effects that could make them change at runtime:\n\n- struct metal_device: needed to know the type and qualifiers of the parameter 'dev' and its members (e.g. whether 'bus' is volatile or const), which affects whether 'dev' or dev->... can be considered invariant.\n\n- struct metal_bus: needed to inspect the 'bus' member type (and its qualifiers) so the expression dev->bus is understood (could the pointer change, is it volatile, etc.).\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops: needed to examine the 'ops' structure and member declarations (qualifiers) so the expression dev->bus->ops is analyzable for possible mutation.\n\n- dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map (member declaration / type): the if (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map) controlling expression depends directly on this function-pointer member; you must know its declaration (type, volatile/atomic qualifiers) to determine whether that expression can be invariant or can change at runtime (including whether concurrent writes are permitted).\n\n- struct metal_sg: needed to know the types/qualifiers of sg_in and sg_out (are they volatile, or do they alias memory that can change), which affects whether '!sg_in'/'!sg_out' can be treated as invariant.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: the constant/enum value used in the 'dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R' test must be known to determine whether the comparison is against a compile-time constant and to reason about possible invariance of the controlling expression.\n\n- uint32_t (typedef): to understand the parameter 'dir' type semantics and whether it can hold values that change concurrently (and whether any implementation-defined behavior could make the comparison invariant).\n\n- atomic_thread_fence: the memory-barrier calls are relevant to reasoning about whether reads of dev/bus/ops/dev_dma_map might be reordered or observed differently across threads; knowing the fence primitive helps determine whether the controlling expressions might observe concurrent changes.\n\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: the specific memory orders used influence visibility guarantees; these affect whether values tested in the controlling expressions can change due to concurrent updates and therefore whether the expressions could be invariant.\n\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: these macros are used as return values but must be known to ensure they are not (mis)used as part of any controlling expression analysis; including them ensures the analyzer has all relevant macro definitions referenced in the function.\n\nCollectively these symbols allow inspection of qualifiers, possible concurrent mutation, and constantness of the values used in the three controlling expressions (!dev || !sg_in || !sg_out), (!dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map), and (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_R) so you can determine whether any of them are invariant (forbidden by MISRA) or allowed (by exception)."
