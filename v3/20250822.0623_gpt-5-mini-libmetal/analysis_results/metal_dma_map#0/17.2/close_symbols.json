  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_dma_map calls itself directly or indirectly (MISRA recursion prohibition) you must resolve the function pointer call dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map. That requires: (1) the exact function-pointer field being invoked so you know the call target is indirect; (2\u20134) the concrete types/definitions (struct metal_device, the bus type, and the ops structure) so you can find where and how that function-pointer is set and what functions can legally occupy it; (5) every concrete function that can be assigned to dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map \u2014 each is a potential direct callee and must be inspected for a path back to metal_dma_map; (6) the transitive callee set reachable from each of those implementations \u2014 indirect recursion can occur through any chain of calls starting from a dev_dma_map implementation, so you must examine the whole reachable call graph from those entry points to detect cycles back to metal_dma_map; and (7) the code that initializes/assigns dev->bus and its ops so you can determine which implementation(s) are actually used at runtime (which assignments establish the pointer targets). Without these symbols (the function-pointer field, the involved type definitions, the implementations assigned to it, their callees, and the assignment sites) you cannot statically prove the absence or presence of an indirect call cycle involving metal_dma_map."
