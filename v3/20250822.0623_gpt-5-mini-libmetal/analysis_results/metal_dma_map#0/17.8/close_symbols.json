  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (function parameter shall not be modified) we must ensure no parameter identifier (dev, dir, sg_in, nents_in, sg_out) is reassigned or implicitly modified via macros/expansions used in this function. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- struct metal_device: verify that \"dev\" is a plain parameter and that \"bus\" is a struct field access (not a macro or operator with side effects).\n- struct metal_bus and struct metal_bus_ops: confirm that \"bus\" and \"ops\" are structure members and inspect the type/layout so that dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map is a member access (not a macro) and to locate the dev_dma_map member.\n- dev_dma_map (dev->bus->ops.dev_dma_map member): examine its declaration/definition to ensure it is a function pointer (or ordinary function) and not a function-like macro that could expand to code that reassigns the local parameter identifiers (e.g., assigns to dev, sg_in, sg_out, nents_in or dir).\n- struct metal_sg: ensure sg_in/sg_out are plain pointer types (not macros) and to check any potential macro-based accessors.\n- atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_release / memory_order_acq_rel: confirm these are library functions/constants (or harmless macros) and do not expand into code that modifies the function parameters.\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: confirm this is a simple constant/macro without side effects used in the conditional (to rule out any hidden parameter modification).\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: verify these are simple error-code macros/constants (no unexpected side effects).\n\nNote: The body of the callee (dev_dma_map implementation) need not be checked for this MISRA rule insofar as a callee modifying the object pointed to is allowed; we only need to ensure no macro or expansion in this function reassigns the parameter identifiers themselves."
