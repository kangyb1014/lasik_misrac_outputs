  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any language/compiler extensions, the analyzer needs the exact declarations/definitions of all referenced symbols so it can detect non-standard language constructs (e.g. compiler attributes, built\u2011ins, non\u2011standard storage-class or type extensions, or macros that expand to compiler extensions):\n\n- struct metal_device: to inspect its member declarations (dev->bus) for any non\u2011standard extensions in the struct definition (unnamed/embedded structs, bitfields using implementation specifics, GCC attributes, etc.).\n- struct metal_bus: to inspect the bus type for extensions on the type or its members.\n- struct metal_bus_ops: the \"ops\" struct type must be examined to see if any of its fields use language extensions (function pointer types with non\u2011standard signatures, attributes, variadic hacks, etc.).\n- dev_dma_map (function pointer prototype in metal_bus_ops): to check the exact prototype used at the call site for non\u2011standard parameter types, calling conventions, attribute annotations, or other extensions (e.g. asm labels, custom calling attributes).\n- struct metal_sg: to ensure the scatter/gather type's definition does not use extensions (flexible array members are standard in C99 but other constructs might be extensions) and to check compatibility with the call.\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_R: to examine whether this macro/enum is defined in a standard way or if it expands to compiler\u2011specific code (e.g. uses __extension__ or nonstandard casts).\n- atomic_thread_fence: to determine whether this symbol is the standard C11 atomic function (stdatomic.h) or a macro/wrapper that maps to a compiler builtin/extension. Its declaration/definition is needed to decide if the code depends on a language extension.\n- memory_order_release and memory_order_acq_rel: to verify these are the standard enum constants from stdatomic.h (C11) and not custom macros that invoke extensions.\n- uint32_t (from stdint.h): to confirm the integer type is the standard fixed-width type and that no nonstandard typedef or extension is being used for the variable 'dir'.\n- EINVAL and ENODEV: to confirm these are the standard errno macros (from errno.h) and not nonstandard macros that could hide extensions.\n- __atomic_thread_fence (compiler builtin mapping, if present): many implementations implement atomic_thread_fence as a wrapper over compiler builtins (e.g. __atomic_thread_fence or __sync_*). Inspecting such builtins or their macro mappings is necessary to detect use of compiler\u2011specific intrinsics (explicit language extensions) rather than purely standard C11 atomics.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their headers/definitions) lets the next agent determine whether any of the constructs used by metal_dma_map rely on compiler language extensions rather than only-standard C constructs."
