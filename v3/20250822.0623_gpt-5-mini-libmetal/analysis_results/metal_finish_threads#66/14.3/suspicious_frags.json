  "explanation": "I examined all control statements in the provided code. None contain an invariant (constant) controlling expression as prohibited by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3:\n\n- metal_finish_threads: for (i = 0; i < threads; i++) \u2014 the controlling expression depends on the loop index i (which changes each iteration) and the parameter threads; it is not an invariant expression.\n- The if checks (if (!tids), if (ret < 0)) in metal_finish_threads and condition() depend on variables that can vary at runtime (tids and ret) and therefore are not invariant.\n- metal_run contains no loop or constant controlling expression; it calls metal_run_noblock and then metal_finish_threads.\n\nNo do-while or intentional infinite-loop constructs with constant controlling expressions are present. Therefore there are no control expressions that appear to be invariant and requiring investigation under Rule 14.3."
