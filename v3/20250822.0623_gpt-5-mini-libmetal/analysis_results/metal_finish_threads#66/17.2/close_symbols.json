  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_finish_threads participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine its callers and the callers'/callees that could form a cycle back to it.\n- condition: Calls metal_finish_threads (and calls other run functions). Inspecting it is necessary to see whether a path condition -> ... -> metal_finish_threads -> ... could create an indirect cycle.\n- metal_run: Calls metal_finish_threads and is a caller of/target for other components; inspect to see possible call chains that could close a cycle.\n- metal_run_noblock: Called by both condition and metal_run; any chain through this function could contribute to an indirect recursion path back to metal_finish_threads.\n- atomic, mutex, shmem, spinlock: These call metal_run (per the static graph). They must be inspected because call chains originating from or passing through them to metal_run/condition/metal_run_noblock could potentially lead back to metal_finish_threads, so they are needed to prove absence (or presence) of indirect recursion."
