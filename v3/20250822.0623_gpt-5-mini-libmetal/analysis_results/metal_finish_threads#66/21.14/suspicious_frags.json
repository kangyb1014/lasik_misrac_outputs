  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code fragments. The function metal_finish_threads performs a NULL-pointer check on tids and calls pthread_join in a loop \u2014 no string operations or memcmp calls are present. The metal_log macro expands to a call to a log handler and metal_fmt, but neither memcmp nor any string-comparison using memcmp appears in the shown macro definition. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp is used elsewhere (e.g. inside metal_fmt or the log handler), those definitions would need to be provided to inspect them; with only the supplied code, nothing violates or even uses memcmp."
