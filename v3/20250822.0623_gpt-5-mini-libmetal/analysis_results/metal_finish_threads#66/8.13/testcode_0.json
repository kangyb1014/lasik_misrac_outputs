  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe pointer tid_p is declared as pthread_t * (obtained from void *tids) but is only used for read access in the call pthread_join(tid_p[i], NULL). Since the pointed-to objects are not modified, tid_p (and the function parameter) could/should be const-qualified (e.g. const pthread_t *tid_p or const void *tids). Therefore this use violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified metal_finish_threads code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/663.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_finish_threads as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_finish_threads:\n```c\nvoid metal_finish_threads(int threads, void *tids)\n{\n\tint i;\n\tpthread_t *tid_p = (pthread_t *)tids;\n\n\tif (!tids) {\n\t\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_ERROR, \"invalid argument, tids is NULL.\\n\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < threads; i++)\n\t\t(void)pthread_join(tid_p[i], NULL);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified metal_finish_threads code.\n",
