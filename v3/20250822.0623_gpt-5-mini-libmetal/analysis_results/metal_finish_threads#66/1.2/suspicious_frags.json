  "explanation": "The macro definition uses GCC/Clang statement-expression extension ({ ... }) and the GNU comma-swallowing token-pasting '##__VA_ARGS__', both are compiler language extensions and must be investigated. The invocation of metal_log in metal_finish_threads should be investigated because it expands to that macro (and therefore to the statement-expression/variadic-extension). Other code fragments do not use language extensions: casting the void * to pthread_t * is standard C pointer casting; using (void)pthread_join(...) to ignore a return value is standard C; the for-loop, NULL check, function signature, and pthread usage are not C language compiler extensions (POSIX pthreads are a library/API, not a compiler language extension) and thus were not flagged."
