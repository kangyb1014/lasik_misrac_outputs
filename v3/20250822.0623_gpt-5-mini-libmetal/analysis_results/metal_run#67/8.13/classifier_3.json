  "scenario": "No violation: tids is an array of pthread_t (not a pointer), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (requiring pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible) is not applicable. A concrete violation would be if a pointer such as 'pthread_t *tids' were used only for read access and should have been declared 'const pthread_t *tids'."
