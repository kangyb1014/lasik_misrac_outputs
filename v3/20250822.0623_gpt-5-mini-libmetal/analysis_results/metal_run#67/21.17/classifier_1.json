  "scenario": "Not violated for the shown fragment: the call metal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids); does not itself use any <string.h> functions and therefore does not by itself breach MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation could occur inside metal_finish_threads if that function uses a string-handling function (e.g. memcpy/memmove/strcpy) with a size/length that exceeds the actual size of the tids array. Example violating scenario inside metal_finish_threads: memcpy(dest, tids, (ts_created + 10) * sizeof(pthread_t)); \u2014 this would access beyond the bounds of tids and violate Rule 21.17."
