  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the body of metal_run. Specifically:\n- There are no assignment statements that assign to the parameters (threads, child, arg).\n- The VLA declaration pthread_t tids[threads]; uses the value of the parameter threads but does not modify it.\n- Calls to metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created); and metal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids); pass parameters (and a pointer to a local) but do not alter the parameters within this function. Casting the local array to (void *) does not modify any parameter.\n- No pointer parameter is reassigned or incremented/decremented in this function.\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing here needs further investigation under that rule."
