  "explanation": "- metal_run_noblock: The call metal_run_noblock(threads, child, arg, tids, &ts_created) must be inspected to ensure it is not a macro that expands into code that assigns to the local parameter variables (threads, child, arg). Its prototype/definition shows whether it takes pointer parameters that could alias the caller's parameters (or if it is an inline/macro that might refer to the caller scope).\n- metal_finish_threads: Same rationale as above for the call metal_finish_threads(ts_created, (void *)tids). We must see its declaration/definition to rule out any macro expansion or unusual linkage that could modify the parameters of metal_run.\n- metal_thread_t: The type of the parameter child must be known (is it a scalar, a function pointer, a pointer type, etc.). Knowing the type clarifies whether passing child could permit indirect modification of the parameter object or whether any called functions might take its address.\n- pthread_t: The VLA tids[threads] uses pthread_t; its typedef/definition is needed to ensure no hidden semantics (macros or unusual definitions) that could result in modifying the parameter variables, and to verify that casting tids to void* is well understood for metal_finish_threads.\n- Preprocessor macros (metal_run_noblock, metal_finish_threads, threads, child, arg): Any macro definitions that shadow these names could change the effective code (e.g., expanding into assignments to the parameter identifiers). The source/preprocessor view is required to be certain the parameter identifiers are not modified indirectly by macro expansion.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether metal_run itself (or its expanded callees in the same translation unit) performs assignments to its formal parameters, which is the essence of the MISRA rule being checked."
