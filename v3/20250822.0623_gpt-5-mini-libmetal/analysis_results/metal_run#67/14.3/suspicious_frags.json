  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- metal_run contains no loop or conditional with a constant/invariant controlling expression.\n\n- In metal_run_noblock the loop \"for (i = 0; i < threads; i++)\" uses i (initialized to 0 and incremented) and the parameter threads. The condition i < threads is not invariant because i is updated each iteration and threads is a function parameter; an early break may terminate the loop but does not make the controlling expression invariant.\n\n- The \"if (!tids)\" check in metal_run_noblock is a normal runtime pointer check; it depends on the function argument and is not an invariant constant expression.\n\n- In metal_finish_threads the loop \"for (i = 0; i < threads; i++)\" likewise depends on i and the threads parameter, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- There are no do-while constructs or deliberate infinite loops (for(;;)) that would fall under the rule exceptions.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in the supplied code that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
