  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking language-extension usage in metal_linux_probe_bus:\n\n- for_each_linux_driver: This is used as the loop construct in the function body. It is very commonly a macro in kernel code and may use compiler extensions (e.g. GNU typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), or complex macro tricks). You must inspect its definition to determine whether it relies on any documented compiler extensions.\n\n- sysfs_open_bus: Called to initialize lbus->sbus. This may be a macro, inline function, or use extensions in its definition; its implementation or macro definition must be checked for language extensions (inline asm, typeof, statement-expr, attributes, nested functions, etc.).\n\n- struct linux_bus: The target code dereferences lbus members (sbus, bus_name, bus). You need the type definition to ensure those member declarations themselves do not use extensions (e.g. non-standard flexible-array variants, anonymous structs/unions as extensions in some compilers, compiler-specific attributes on members) and to confirm whether any field access relies on macro-generated code.\n\n- struct linux_driver: Required because for_each_linux_driver iterates over linux_driver objects; the driver type definition can reveal if iteration macros rely on non-standard constructs (e.g. non-standard container_of helpers) or if the type contains compiler-specific attributes.\n\n- ENODEV: The errno constant used in the function. Although normally standard, its definition should be checked to ensure it is not redefined via a compiler-specific extension or unusual macro that would violate the rule.\n\n- metal_linux_bus_close: The target calls this symbol; if it is actually a macro or is implemented using macros (or expands into code using extensions through inlining or macros like to_linux_bus), the call in the target function could be using language extensions indirectly. Inspect its definition to confirm it is a plain function or to detect any extensions.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_driver: Called inside the iteration. Its declaration/definition is required to determine whether the call is a plain function call or a macro/inline construct that employs extensions.\n\n- metal_linux_register_bus: Called near the end of the target. As with the other callees, its definition must be checked to ensure it does not expand to code that uses compiler extensions (attributes, statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, etc.).\n\n- to_linux_bus: This symbol appears in the static call graph under metal_linux_bus_close and is commonly a macro (often built on container_of). Even though it is not used directly in metal_linux_probe_bus, if any of the called functions/macros expand to or rely on to_linux_bus, that expansion could introduce compiler extensions into code executed (or expanded) in the context of the target function. Inspecting it helps find indirect uses of extensions (e.g. container_of uses GNU typeof).\n\nNote: The focus is on symbols that are likely macros or inline constructs (for_each_linux_driver, sysfs_open_bus, to_linux_bus) and on the type definitions for the objects being referenced. These items are the most likely places where documented compiler extensions (typeof, statement-expression, nested functions, attributes, asm, etc.) would appear and thereby cause the target function to violate the MISRA rule."
