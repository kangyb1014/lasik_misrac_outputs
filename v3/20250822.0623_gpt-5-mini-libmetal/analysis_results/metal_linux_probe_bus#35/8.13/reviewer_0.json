True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe loop iterator variable ldrv is declared as a non-const pointer (struct linux_driver *ldrv) and is used only to reference driver data in the loop. If the loop and called functions (e.g. metal_linux_probe_driver) do not modify the pointed-to driver object, then the pointer should be const-qualified. In that case the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Fix: declare the iterator as const struct linux_driver *ldrv (and update the for_each_linux_driver macro and any callee prototypes to accept a const pointer).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not conclusively correct based on the code shown. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified via that pointer. In the snippet ldrv is only used as an iterator and not modified locally, but it is passed to metal_linux_probe_driver (and iterated via a for_each_linux_driver macro). From this fragment alone we cannot determine whether the driver object is modified through ldrv (either inside the macro expansion or inside metal_linux_probe_driver or other callees). If those routines accept or perform non-const operations on the driver, then ldrv must remain a non-const pointer and there is no rule violation.\n\nTherefore the agent\u2019s claim is speculative: it would be a valid MISRA 8.13 violation only if a static analysis of the macro and all callees shows the pointed-to linux_driver objects are never modified. To resolve: inspect the definitions of for_each_linux_driver and metal_linux_probe_driver (and any other callees) \u2014 if they do not modify the driver and their prototypes can be changed to take const struct linux_driver *, update the iterator declaration, macro and prototypes to be const-correct. If any of those modify the driver, no violation exists.\n"
