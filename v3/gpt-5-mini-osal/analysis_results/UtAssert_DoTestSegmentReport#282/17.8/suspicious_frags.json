  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies any function parameter. Both parameters are pointer types to const data (const char *SegmentName, const UtAssert_TestCounter_t *TestCounters) and are only read: there are no assignments, increments, pointer arithmetic, or lvalue uses of SegmentName or TestCounters. The code dereferences TestCounters to read counts (allowed) and passes SegmentName and the values to snprintf and UT_BSP_DoText by value; these calls do not modify the pointer variables themselves. All writes are to the local ReportBuffer array. There are no casts that remove const, no taking of the address of a parameter to enable modification, and no other indirect modifications of the parameters. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 17.8."
