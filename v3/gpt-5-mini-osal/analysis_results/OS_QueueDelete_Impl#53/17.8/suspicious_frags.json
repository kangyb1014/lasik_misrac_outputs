  "explanation": "No fragments that modify the function parameter were found. Reasons:\n- There is no assignment to the parameter identifier token (no statements like token = ...).\n- The only use of token is as *token in the macro call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_queue_table, *token). That dereferences the pointer to access the referenced object; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule, and here no modification occurs (only read access to obtain the index).\n- The macro expansion effectively calls OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token)), which yields the same pointer value as token; taking the address of *token does not change the pointer parameter itself.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const OS_object_token_t * and only reads token->obj_idx (no modification of the pointer or the object).\n- No other uses in the function alter token (no pointer arithmetic, no reassignment, no passing of &token to a function that could modify it).\n- The mq_close(impl->id) call only uses impl (derived from table lookup) and does not modify the token parameter.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
