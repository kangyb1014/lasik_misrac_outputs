  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are compile-time invariant. The only conditional is\nif (mq_close(impl->id) != 0)\nwhich depends on the runtime return value of mq_close and on impl->id (derived from the token). The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken sequence reads token->obj_idx at runtime and does not produce an invariant controlling value. There are no loops or other conditionals in the function that evaluate to a constant expression (no do-while, for, or while constructs). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
