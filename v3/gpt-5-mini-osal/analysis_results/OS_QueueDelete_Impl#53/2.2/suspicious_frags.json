  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not appear to be candidates for dead-code removal and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: - The call to mq_close(impl->id) has an observable side effect (closing the message queue descriptor) and its return value is used to determine control flow, so it cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. - The conditional and both assignments to return_code (OS_ERROR / OS_SUCCESS) are used to convey the function outcome and are returned; they are not inert. - The final return of return_code is necessary to propagate the result. - The local variable declarations are used by the function. These elements are active parts of the observable behaviour and therefore are not suspected dead code."
