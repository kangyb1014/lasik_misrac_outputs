  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: \n- The function sequence is: obtain impl via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, call mq_close(impl->id), set return_code in either the if (mq_close(...) != 0) branch or the else branch, and then return return_code. Every statement is reachable during normal execution: the if and else branches are mutually exclusive but both reachable depending on runtime mq_close result.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array access using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(...)). OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is an inline accessor that returns token->obj_idx; this does not introduce unreachable code (it may raise index/validity concerns at runtime, but that is not an unreachable-code issue per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1).\n- The empty OS_DEBUG macro removes debug output but does not create unreachable code.\n- There are no early returns, infinite loops, or code placed after an unconditional return/goto that would be unreachable.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the given snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want analysis for related issues (e.g., potential out-of-bounds indexing, null/invalid token handling, or error-handling robustness), indicate that and I will report relevant fragments to inspect."
