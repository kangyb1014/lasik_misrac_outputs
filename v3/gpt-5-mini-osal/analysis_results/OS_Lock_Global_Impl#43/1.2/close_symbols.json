  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions it relies on, because extensions often appear in type/macros/variable definitions rather than in this small function body. Specifically:\n\n- osal_objtype_t: Needed to see whether this type is a plain C typedef/enum or uses a compiler extension (e.g. typeof, __attribute__, or other nonstandard typedef constructs).\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct/typedef definition must be inspected for extensions (unnamed/anonymous structs/unions, bit-field types with nonstandard widths, __attribute__ annotations, or other compiler-specific syntax). It also shows the type of impl->mutex.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The declaration/definition of this symbol may be a macro or use storage-class/section/attribute extensions (for example __attribute__((section(...))) or complex macro wrappers). It may also be defined via an extension such as a gcc statement-expression or compound literal in a nonstandard way.\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro/function must be examined because debugging/logging macros commonly use variadic macros (standard since C99) or compiler extensions (statement-expressions, __builtin_printf wrappers, __attribute__ on macros, or other nonstandard constructs). You need its definition to confirm only standard C features are used.\n- pthread_mutex_lock: The prototype (from pthreads headers) should be checked to ensure there are no nonstandard decorations or compiler-specific attributes in the declaration used in this build environment.\n- pthread_mutex_t: The type of impl->mutex (usually pthread_mutex_t) must be checked to ensure its definition in the target environment does not use compiler extensions (e.g., typedefs to compiler built-ins or attributes).\n- strerror: The declaration/implementation (from string.h) should be checked for any nonstandard wrapper macros or attributes; also some platforms provide nonstandard variants or macros that could be extensions.\n\nInspecting these symbols lets the next analyzer detect any use of language extensions (GCC/Clang attributes, statement-expressions, typeof, nonstandard anonymous struct features, nonstandard storage-class attributes, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
