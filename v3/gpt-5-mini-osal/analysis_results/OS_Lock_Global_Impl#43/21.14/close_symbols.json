  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for MISRA rule (no use of memcmp on null-terminated strings):\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The target function directly indexes this global to obtain impl. Its declaration/initializer must be inspected to ensure there are no hidden wrappers, macros, or initializers that use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - Definition of the struct is required to see the type and any inline/embedded operations on members (impl->mutex). If the type includes inline functions or macros, they could call memcmp.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The index type used to access the table; its typedef or enum might be tied to macros or inline conversion helpers that could contain string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - The function called on impl->mutex. Its implementation (or any platform wrapper used in this project) must be checked to ensure it does not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- strerror\n  - Called to get a message string. The implementation should be inspected in case it uses memcmp internally (or if the project provides its own strerror wrapper that might violate the rule).\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - The logging macro/function used with the strerror result. Its definition may invoke formatting or comparison helpers; any of those could use memcmp on C strings.\n\n- OS_DEBUG's underlying formatting helpers (e.g. printf/snprintf/vfprintf)\n  - If OS_DEBUG forwards to standard or project-specific formatting routines, those implementations or wrappers should be inspected for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule concerns any use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings reachable from the target code. Although OS_Lock_Global_Impl does not call memcmp directly, any symbol it references (globals, types, or called functions/macros) might contain such a use. The listed symbols are the minimal set of definitions/implementations that must be inspected to determine whether the rule is violated in the context of this function."
