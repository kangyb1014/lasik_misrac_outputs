  "explanation": "To decide if this function violates the MISRA guidance \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" you must inspect the types and const-qualifications of any pointers that appear or are derived in the function and any called APIs that constrain constness. Each listed symbol is needed for that check:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: this is the source of the pointer assigned to local variable \"impl\". You must know its declaration (array type, element pointer type and any const qualifiers on the pointers or pointed-to objects) to determine whether the pointer could/should be to a const-qualified target.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: the struct type of the table elements. You need its definition (including the type and constness of its members, particularly the \"mutex\" member) to determine whether the pointed-to object is mutable or could reasonably be const-qualified.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: prototype of this API is required because it dictates whether the address-of the mutex (\"&impl->mutex\") must be a pointer to mutable pthread_mutex_t (its parameter type). If the API requires a non-const pointer, that constrains whether the mutex (and thus the containing object) can be const.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: the concrete type used for the mutex member. Knowing whether this type is or must be treated as mutable (and whether its address parameter is non-const) bears on whether the pointer should be const-qualified.\n\n- strerror: returns a pointer type used as an argument to OS_DEBUG. Its return type (char * vs const char *) can affect whether the code uses non-const pointers where const would be appropriate.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: the logging macro/function signature (parameter types) is needed to check whether any pointers passed into it (format string and strerror result) are required or should be declared const.\n\nWith these declarations you can determine (a) whether the pointers in this function are pointing to objects that must be mutable (thus correctly non-const), or (b) whether some pointers could/should have been declared to point-to-const and thus would violate MISRA if they are not const-qualified."
