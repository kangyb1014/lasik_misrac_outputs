The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl contains no for statements and calls no other functions, so there are no callees whose behavior could contribute to a for-loop violation. To be conservative and ensure there are no hidden for-loops or side-effects introduced by macro/type expansions, the following symbols should be inspected:\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: This is used in the return statement. If OS_SUCCESS were a macro (or macro that expands to an expression), it could conceivably expand to code that contains a for loop or persistent side effects, so its definition must be checked.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: This is the function parameter type. While a plain typedef cannot introduce code, it could be a macro alias or have attributes that change semantics; checking its definition ensures there are no unexpected macro expansions or constructs that could introduce for-loops or side effects within the function signature.\n\nNo other symbols are required because the function body is a single return statement with no loops and it makes no function calls whose behavior would need to be included in the for-loop analysis."
