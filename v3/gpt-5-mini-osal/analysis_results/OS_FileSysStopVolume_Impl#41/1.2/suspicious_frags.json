  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. The function uses a typedef'd int32 (based on standard int32_t), a const pointer parameter, C-style block comments, and a macro OS_SUCCESS defined as (0) \u2014 all standard C constructs. The body is a simple return statement; there are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions, zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific keywords or syntax. The ellipsis shown in the additional code is an omission marker in the snippet, not part of the code. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
