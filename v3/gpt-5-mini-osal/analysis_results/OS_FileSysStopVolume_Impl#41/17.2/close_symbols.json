  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion, the analyzer must inspect any callers and the transitive callees reachable from those callers to see if a call-path returns to OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl. The required symbols are:\n\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize: direct caller of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl per the call graph; any calls made by this function could form an indirect cycle back to StopVolume_Impl.\n- OS_rmfs: another direct caller; its call behavior must be inspected for paths back to StopVolume_Impl.\n- OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl: called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; may call StopVolume_Impl (or call others that do) creating indirect recursion.\n- OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl: called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; likewise could contain calls that lead back to StopVolume_Impl.\n- OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew: utilities called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; any of these (or functions they call) could conceivably call StopVolume_Impl -> include to rule out indirect recursion via object-id helpers.\n- OS_printf: lightweight callee of both callers; included to confirm it does not call back into file-system functions (normally does not, so it helps rule out false cycles).\n- OS_ObjectIdGetByName, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: called by OS_rmfs; must be checked for paths returning to StopVolume_Impl.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: test/UT framework calls listed under OS_rmfs; include to ensure no test-framework-mediated path calls back into StopVolume_Impl.\n\nIncluding these symbols (the direct callers and their listed callees) lets the next analyst follow all static call-paths from the callers to determine whether any path reaches back to OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl, which is necessary to conclude whether the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls is violated."
