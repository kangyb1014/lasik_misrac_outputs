The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * This is a no-op.\n     *\n     * Volatile volumes are just directories created in the temp dir,\n     * and this will not remove the directories just in case something\n     * went wrong.\n     *\n     * If the volume is started again, the directory will be re-used.\n     */\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl:\nint32 OS_FileSys_Initialize(char *address, const char *fsdevname, const char *fsvolname, size_t blocksize,\n                            osal_blockcount_t numblocks, bool should_format)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"address\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly null.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsdevname, sizeof(filesys->device_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n\n    /* check names are not empty strings */\n    if (fsdevname[0] == 0 || fsvolname[0] == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_FS_ERR_PATH_INVALID;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, fsdevname, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n        OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, filesys, device_name, fsdevname);\n\n        /* populate the VolumeName and BlockSize ahead of the Impl call,\n         * so the implementation can reference this info if necessary */\n        filesys->blocksize = blocksize;\n        filesys->numblocks = numblocks;\n        filesys->address   = address;\n        strncpy(filesys->volume_name, fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name) - 1);\n\n        /*\n         * Determine basic type of filesystem, if not already known\n         *\n         * if either an address was supplied, or if the volume name\n         * contains the string \"RAM\" then it is a RAM disk.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl is invoked by callers (e.g. OS_FileSys_Initialize and OS_rmfs). Although the implementation is currently a no-op, it is executed and can affect caller behavior via its return value and timing (and serves as a platform-specific placeholder). Removing the function or its calls could change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
