  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u2018a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u2019 we must know the exact type and usage of the token parameter and whether applying const is meaningful at the correct indirection level:\n\n- OS_object_token_t: Essential. The typedef/struct definition shows whether OS_object_token_t itself is a pointer type (e.g., typedef foo *OS_object_token_t) or an object type. Because const placement interacts with typedefs, knowing the underlying type is required to determine whether 'const OS_object_token_t *token' makes the pointed-to object const or only makes a pointer const (different semantics).\n\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize and OS_rmfs (call-sites): These are the callers listed in the static call graph. Inspecting their definitions and the exact call-sites shows how the token objects are created and passed (addresses, temporaries, casts). That reveals whether callers expect to pass mutable tokens or if they modify the token after the call \u2014 relevant to whether the parameter can/should be const.\n\n- OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl declaration in the header: Compare the header prototype to the implementation to ensure const is applied at the intended level and to see how the API is meant to be used externally.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdGetByName, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: These object-management functions appear in the call graph around the same modules and operate on object/token types. Their signatures and behavior show whether token objects are commonly modified or passed through APIs that require non-const pointers; this affects whether making the parameter (or deeper pointee) const would be compatible with the rest of the code.\n\n- OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl and OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl: These sibling file-system functions take similar parameters; their declarations/definitions provide context and a precedent for const qualification on token parameters across the module.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine (1) the true underlying type and pointer indirection of OS_object_token_t, (2) whether the const in the implementation actually qualifies the intended object, and (3) whether callers or related APIs require mutation that would make a const qualifier inappropriate."
