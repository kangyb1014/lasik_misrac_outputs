  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments need inspection for possible unreachable-code issues relating to Rule 2.1. The implementation of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl is an immediate return of OS_SUCCESS, and the two call sites shown rely on that function to perform stop/cleanup or to potentially fail; this combination may render expected error/cleanup paths effectively unexercised and should be checked.\n\nOther code in the snippets (OS_FileSys_Initialize, OS_rmfs surrounding logic, OS_mkfs/OS_initfs mapping, and the OS_SUCCESS macro) contains conditional checks and runtime-dependent branches (e.g. return_code checks, parameter validations, calls to OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew/GetByName) and therefore is not provably unreachable from static inspection of the provided code. No other code fragment in the provided excerpts contains statements positioned after an unconditional return or a constant-false conditional that would make them syntactically unreachable, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 based solely on the shown source."
