  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl takes a pointer parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' but the parameter is not used anywhere in the function body (no assignments to 'token', no dereferences, no casts). The pointer itself is not modified, and the pointed-to object is declared const so it cannot be modified. The function body is a simple no-op returning OS_SUCCESS, and there are no other statements that could modify the parameter. Therefore there is no code to investigate for noncompliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
