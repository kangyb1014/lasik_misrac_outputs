  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol directly. To assess whether any invariant controlling expression exists (or whether the return is produced by a macro that could introduce control flow), the exact definition of OS_SUCCESS must be known (macro, enum, constant expression, or something more complex). If OS_SUCCESS were a macro that expands to control constructs or non-constant expressions it could affect a MISRA analysis.\n\n- int32: The return type is written as int32. The typedef/definition is needed to ensure this is a simple integer typedef and not a macro or an expression that could alter control flow or introduce compile-time invariants via unusual expansion. Knowing the precise type also helps confirm that the function contains no implicit control expressions related to the return type.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The parameter type should be checked to ensure it is a plain type declaration (possibly a struct typedef) and not a macro or inline construct that expands into additional statements/expressions in the function body. Although the parameter is unused in the shown body, a macro-based type could mask additional control constructs when the preprocessor expands headers."
