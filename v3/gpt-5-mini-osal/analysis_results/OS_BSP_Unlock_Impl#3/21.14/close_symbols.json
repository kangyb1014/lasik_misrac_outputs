  "explanation": "BSP_DEBUG \u2014 This is invoked from the target and is often a macro/wrapper that can expand into logging/utility code. Inspect its definition/implementation to ensure it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings (e.g., comparing message strings) or expand into other code that does so.\n\nstrerror \u2014 This standard-library helper is called to obtain an error message string. Check whether the project provides a wrapper/override of strerror (or a local implementation) that uses memcmp on null-terminated strings. If strerror is the system/library implementation, it is normally out-of-scope for MISRA violations in user code, but a project-supplied replacement could matter.\n\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal \u2014 This object/structure (and any accessor macros) is referenced for AccessMutex and AccessCancelState. Verify its definition to detect any macro expansions or inline functions that might contain memcmp usage (for example, accessor macros that do string comparisons) which would make the target function indirectly use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\npthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 It is called by the target. Confirm whether it is a direct call to the pthread library or a project wrapper/macro; if a wrapper exists in project code, inspect it for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings (a direct system pthread implementation is not typically counted as user MISRA violation).\n\npthread_setcancelstate \u2014 Same rationale as pthread_mutex_unlock: if this is a project-provided wrapper or macro, inspect its definition for memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings; if it is the system pthread function, it is unlikely to constitute a user-level MISRA violation.\n\nNotes for analysis: for each listed symbol you should obtain its local definition/implementation (not just prototype) within the codebase to determine whether memcmp is called and whether that call is used to compare null-terminated strings. If all listed symbols resolve to standard/system library implementations with no project overrides, the target function itself contains no memcmp usage and therefore does not violate the MISRA rule."
