  "explanation": "No other uses of functions from <string.h> are present in the provided function. The remaining calls (pthread_mutex_unlock, pthread_setcancelstate) are pthread functions, not string.h string-handling functions. The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined empty in the additional code, so there are no other string operations introduced by that macro in this translation unit. Therefore no other fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
