  "explanation": "BSP_DEBUG \u2014 could be a macro or function that performs logging via the console or other project functions; its body must be inspected to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl (e.g. through OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl), which would create indirect recursion.\n\nOS_ConsoleOutput_Impl \u2014 appears in the static call graph as a caller of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl; if BSP_DEBUG or any other callee invoked by OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl calls OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl, that would close a recursion cycle. The implementation must be checked to confirm call relationships.\n\nOS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl \u2014 a likely backend used by console-output logging paths; if BSP_DEBUG routes through this, and it in turn calls OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl or OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl, that can create indirect recursion. Include for the same reason as OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl.\n\npthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 a direct call in the function body. Although normally a libc function, the project could wrap or replace it; inspect whether the symbol is the standard library call or a project wrapper that might call back into OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl.\n\npthread_setcancelstate \u2014 same rationale as pthread_mutex_unlock: verify it is the standard library call and does not transitively call project code that could reach OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl.\n\nstrerror \u2014 used in the debug path; inspect whether this is the standard library function or a project-provided wrapper that might call project logging/console functions.\n\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal \u2014 the global object whose members are used (AccessMutex, AccessCancelState). While not a function, its type/definition can reveal if accessors or macros are used around its fields (or if reading them invokes functions) and helps confirm there are no hidden calls to OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl via accessors or macros.\n\nTogether these symbols allow the next analyst to determine whether any function invoked (directly or via macros) from OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl can call back to OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl (directly or indirectly), which is required to verify compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding self-calls/indirect recursion."
