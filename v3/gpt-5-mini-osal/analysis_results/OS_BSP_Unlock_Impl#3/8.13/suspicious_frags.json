  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not contain pointer expressions that are subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The local variable declaration and use (int status), the integer comparison (if (status < 0)), the else branch control flow, and the function return type (void) are not pointer uses and therefore do not need investigation under the pointer const-qualification rule. The listed fragments cover all occurrences of pointer expressions or pointer-returning function calls in the provided code; no additional pointer-related constructs are present that would need review for const qualification."
