True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call to strerror(status) returns a char * to a static, read-only error message buffer. The returned pointer is not const-qualified even though the data is not to be modified, so the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const char *). Therefore this usage violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Remedy: use a const char * to hold the result, use strerror_r into a const-qualified buffer, or cast the result to const char * with justification.)\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nOS_BSP_Unlock_Impl: pthread_mutex_unlock succeeded (status=0).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not intended to be modified. In the snippet there is no pointer declaration receiving the result of strerror \u2014 the function call is passed directly into BSP_DEBUG/printf. The underlying library function strerror has the signature char *strerror(int) (POSIX/C), so its return type is not const; that is an API provided by the system library and cannot be changed here. Assigning the returned char * to a const-qualified pointer (const char *msg = strerror(status);) would be allowed and would satisfy the spirit of 8.13 if you wanted an explicit pointer variable. Alternatively, you may cast to const char * with a documented justification. In short, the reported violation is not correct as written: the code does not declare a non-const pointer that should be const, and the non-const return type comes from the standard library API (an allowed/necessary interaction). If you want to be explicit about const-correctness you can assign the result to a const char * or use strerror_r and a const-qualified buffer, but the existing code as shown does not itself demonstrably breach Rule 8.13."
