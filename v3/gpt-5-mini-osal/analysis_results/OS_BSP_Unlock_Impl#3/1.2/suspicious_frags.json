  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function definition, variable declaration (int status;), if/else, and comments are all standard C. The calls to pthread_mutex_unlock, pthread_setcancelstate and strerror are POSIX/C library functions, not language extensions. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (for example: no __attribute__, __builtin_*, asm, typeof, nested functions, statement-expression ({ ... }), __extension__, or other vendor-specific extensions). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions). Note: any potential logic or API usage issues (for example error handling semantics) are outside the scope of Rule 1.2 and thus not flagged here."
