  "explanation": "Other code fragments were not selected because they implement core, observable program behaviour and are unlikely to be removable without changing program semantics. In particular:\n- The while-loop and its use of OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext / OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry perform the essential iteration and per-file close operations; removing these would clearly change behaviour.\n- The call to OS_FileIteratorClose (which returns OS_close(filedes)) and the handling of close_code are part of the externally visible close operations; their presence is required to effect file closes and to propagate error codes.\n- The lock/unlock implementations (assigning lock keys, updating owner_key, calling OS_Lock_Global_Impl / OS_Unlock_Global_Impl) perform synchronization and ownership tracking needed for correct concurrent behaviour; these assignments and calls are not candidates for dead-code removal.\n- The match-function invocation and record lookup inside the iterator are used to select table entries and control iteration; they affect which entries are processed and thus cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- Macro/constant definitions such as #define OS_SUCCESS (0) are used in return comparisons and initializations and are therefore functional.\n\nThe fragments listed in suspicious_frags are places where an executed operation appears possibly redundant or defensive (e.g. explicit initialization of token fields, iterator destroy/cleanup, debug-only branches, small inline accessors or repeated flag assignments). These deserve further investigation to determine if their execution can be removed without changing observable behaviour (i.e. to check for dead code under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2)."
