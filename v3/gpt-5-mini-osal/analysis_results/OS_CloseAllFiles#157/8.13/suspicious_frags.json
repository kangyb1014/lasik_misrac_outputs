  "explanation": "Only calls that take the address of iter involve pointers and therefore may be subject to Rule 8.13 (i.e. whether the functions could/should accept a pointer to const). Other fragments in the function are scalar declarations/assignments, comparisons, the return statement, and a comment; none introduce pointer types or pass pointers that would be relevant to checking whether a pointer should point to a const-qualified type, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
