  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code fragments. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 specifically applies to the formation of for loops (the three header clauses, a single loop counter, and constraints on side effects). The code uses while and do-while loops (OS_CloseAllFiles uses while; OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext uses a do-while) and function calls; these constructs are outside the scope of Rule 14.2 and therefore do not require investigation for that rule. The visible increments (e.g. ++iter->token.obj_idx) occur inside a do-while body, not in a for loop header, so they are not subject to the for-loop clause requirements. If there are any for loops in code not shown (indicated by the ellipses), those specific for statements would need to be supplied to perform rule-14.2 checking."
