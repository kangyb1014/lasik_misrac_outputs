  "explanation": "OS_CloseAllFiles itself has no function parameters, so there is no risk of this function violating Rule 17.8 by modifying its own parameters. The only places that could involve modification of function parameters are the calls that pass the address of the local iterator (\"&iter\") to other functions: these callees receive a pointer parameter and must not modify the pointer parameter itself (they may modify the pointed-to object). All other lines (local variable declarations and assignments, the loop control, the return statement, and the use of value arguments such as LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE or the function pointer OS_FileIteratorClose) do not involve passing or modifying a function parameter and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
