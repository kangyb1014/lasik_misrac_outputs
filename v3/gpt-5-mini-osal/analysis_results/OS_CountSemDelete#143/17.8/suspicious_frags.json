  "explanation": "No function parameter of OS_CountSemDelete is modified. The sole parameter sem_id is only read and passed to OS_ObjectIdGetById; there are no assignments to sem_id and it is not passed by address. The only pointers used in this function are &token (address of a local variable), which may be used by the called routines to modify the pointed-to object; this is permitted by Rule 17.8 because the rule forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself, not the object it points to. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
