  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions of conditional/loop constructs (if, switch, while, for, do-while, conditional ?:) that are invariant. The provided function OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl contains no conditional or loop constructs \u2014 it only contains a block comment and a single return statement returning the constant OS_SUCCESS. The related symbol definitions shown (#define OS_SUCCESS (0), the typedefs and struct) also contain no controlling expressions. Therefore there are no controlling expressions in this code that could be invariant and no code fragments that need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
