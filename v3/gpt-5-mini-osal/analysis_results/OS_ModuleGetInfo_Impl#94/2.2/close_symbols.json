  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is dead code (removal would not affect program behaviour) we must see where and how it is used and whether its return or side-effects are observable. Required symbols and why:\n\n- OS_ModuleInfo: Primary caller in the provided call graph. Inspecting its implementation is essential to determine how it invokes OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl (always, conditionally, via function pointer, etc.), whether it uses the return value or expects side-effects, and whether removal would change behaviour or produce link-time errors.\n\n- OS_printf: Used by OS_ModuleInfo for logging/output. Logging is an observable behaviour \u2014 if OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl influences code paths that lead to different logging, removal may alter behaviour.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease: These are used by OS_ModuleInfo to manipulate tokens/objects. Understanding their semantics shows whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl must execute to maintain object lifetime, resource accounting, or to populate outputs that OS_ModuleInfo passes on \u2014 all relevant to dead-code determination.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These unit-test stub functions appear in OS_ModuleInfo's call graph. They indicate test harness involvement; we must determine whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is only referenced in test scaffolding (dead in production) or invoked in production code paths. Inspecting these symbols clarifies whether calls are test-only or part of normal behaviour.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The returned constant. Its meaning/value can affect program behaviour (e.g., success vs error codes used by callers). Confirming its value and how callers act on it is necessary to judge whether the trivial return of OS_SUCCESS is meaningful or redundant.\n\n- OS_object_token_t, OS_module_prop_t: The types of the parameters. Knowing the fields and their initialization/usage tells us whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is expected to modify module_prop (side-effect) and whether removing the function would leave outputs uninitialized or change observable state.\n\n- module implementation registration/dispatch symbol(s) (e.g. OS_impl_module_table, OS_Module_API): Many OSAL-style implementations register per-object-type operation vectors (function pointers). If OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is referenced via such a table, its removal could change dispatch behaviour or cause linkage failures. Identifying any registration/export that references this symbol is required to conclude whether the function is actually reachable/used.\n\nProvide the above symbols/code to the next analyst so they can inspect call sites, conditional logic, observable side-effects, test-only usage, and any registration/dispatch references to determine whether removing OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl would change program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
