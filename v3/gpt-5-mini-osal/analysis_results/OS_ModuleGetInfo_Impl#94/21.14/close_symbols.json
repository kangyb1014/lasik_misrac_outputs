  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule explicitly concerns use of memcmp for comparing NUL-terminated strings. To determine whether the target function violates the rule you must be able to find any direct use of memcmp or any macro/inline that expands to or calls memcmp in the function body or in headers included by it.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns OS_SUCCESS. You need its definition to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro or function that could expand to or call memcmp (very unlikely but necessary to rule out indirect use).\n- OS_module_prop_t: One of the function parameters. Obtain its typedef/definition to check for embedded inline functions, macros, or annotations that might be invoked implicitly (or expanded in headers) and that could use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n- OS_object_token_t: The other parameter; its type/definition similarly must be checked for any inline helpers/macros that could be invoked or expanded and use memcmp.\n- OS_ModuleInfo: The caller of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl. Include it for context: its implementation and inlined headers may reveal macros or inlines shared with the target that could cause memcmp usage to appear in the compilation unit even though the target source appears empty.\n\nNote: The target function body contains no obvious string operations; the primary check is for any direct or macro/inline- expanded uses of memcmp in the function (or via symbols/macros it returns/uses). The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to rule out such direct or indirect uses."
