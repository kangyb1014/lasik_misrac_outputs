  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function or related symbols. The implementation of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl contains a single return statement (return OS_SUCCESS;) and no code after that return, no conditional branches, no labels, no gotos, and no loops that would create unreachable paths. The comment block is non-executable. The related symbol definitions (macro OS_SUCCESS, typedefs and struct) are declarations only and do not introduce executable statements that could be unreachable. Although the function parameters are unused, that is an unused-parameter issue, not unreachable code. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
