The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol:\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function simply returns this symbol. To prove there is no hidden for-loop or side-effect (e.g., a macro that expands to code containing a for statement or modifications to objects), the definition of OS_SUCCESS must be checked to ensure it is a simple constant/enum and not a macro that could violate the MISRA for-loop rule.\n- OS_object_token_t: The parameter type should be inspected to ensure it is a plain typedef/struct and not a macro or inline construct that could introduce loop behaviour or modify loop counters via hidden code when passed; this rules out any surprising expansions that could affect the for-loop analysis.\n- OS_module_prop_t: Same reason as OS_object_token_t \u2014 confirm it is a benign type (typedef/struct) and not a macro or function-like construct that could contain or trigger for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA's definition of loop behaviour.\nNotes: The target function contains no for-loops and calls no other functions, so no additional callee symbols need inspection for this MISRA rule. The three symbols above are sufficient to rule out hidden macro/type expansions that might introduce loop constructs or side effects."
