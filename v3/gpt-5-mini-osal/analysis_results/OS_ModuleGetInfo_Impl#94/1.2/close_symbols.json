  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: This macro/enum is returned by the function. Its definition could hide compiler-specific extensions (for example using __extension__, __attribute__, or non-standard constructs). You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand to or rely on a compiler extension.\n- int32: The function return type is a typedef (or macro) named int32. The underlying typedef or macro may be implemented via non-standard constructs or compiler-specific types; its definition must be checked to ensure it is standard C (or from a sanctioned stdint typedef) and not an extension.\n- OS_object_token_t: The parameter type could be a typedef, struct, or macro that uses non-standard language extensions (attributes, packed/aligned extensions, anonymous structs/unions in non-standard ways). Inspecting its definition is required to ensure no compiler extensions are used.\n- OS_module_prop_t: Same reason as OS_object_token_t \u2014 the parameter type\u2019s definition may contain compiler-specific extensions (attributes, GCC/Clang extensions, pragmas) that would violate the MISRA rule.\n- function-declaration/attribute macros (e.g. OS_API, OSAL_ATTR, any macro placed before/after the function name): Although not visible in the snippet, translation-unit-level macros sometimes wrap or annotate function declarations/definitions. These macros can expand to compiler-specific attributes or pragmas (for calling convention, visibility, deprecation, etc.). You must check any macros that affect this function\u2019s declaration/definition to detect use of language extensions."
