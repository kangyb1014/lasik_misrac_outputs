  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. The provided function and related definitions use only standard C language constructs: function declaration/definition, return of a macro constant, typedefs based on stdint types, and struct members. There are no compiler-specific language extensions present (for example: no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, __extension__, __int128, zero-length arrays, or other documented compiler extensions). The comment mentioning dlinfo() refers to a non-POSIX library API, which is a platform/library extension rather than a compiler language extension and therefore is outside the scope of Rule 1.2. Based on the supplied code, no fragments require further investigation under Rule 1.2."
