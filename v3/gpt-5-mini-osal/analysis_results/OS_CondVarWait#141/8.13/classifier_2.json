  "scenario": "OS_object_token_t token is an object (non\u2011pointer) and is passed by address (&token). Rule 8.13 applies to pointer declarations requiring const qualification when possible. Since token is not declared as a pointer type here, the rule is not violated. (If OS_object_token_t were actually a typedef for a pointer type, then a lack of const could be a violation, but the code fragment shows token used as an object address, so it is not a pointer.)"
