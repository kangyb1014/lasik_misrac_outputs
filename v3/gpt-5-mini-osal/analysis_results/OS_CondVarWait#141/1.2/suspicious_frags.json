  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions as described by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or builtins present (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) or GCC/Clang-specific extensions).\n- The pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop usage is a POSIX threads API macro pair (library-level), not a compiler language extension; their use is an API facility rather than a compiler-specific language extension. Any internal implementation details of these macros (in the C library) are outside the scope of this source and would need to be checked against the C library documentation if desired.\n- typedefs (int32, osal_id_t), standard fixed-width integer types (int32_t/uint32_t), pointer-to-incomplete-type usage, macros like OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and constant macros (OS_SUCCESS, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR) are all standard C constructs or preprocessor artifacts, not compiler language extensions.\n- No inline assembly, nonstandard linkage specifications, or other vendor-specific language features appear in the provided fragments.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for potential use of compiler language extensions."
