  "explanation": "The function parameter list contains only 'osal_id_t var_id' (a scalar passed by value) and it is not assigned to or modified anywhere in the function. All other assignments operate on local variables (return_code, token). The calls OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., var_id, &token) and OS_CondVarWait_Impl(&token) pass values and the address of a local object; they do not modify the function's parameter variable itself. There are no pointer parameters in OS_CondVarWait that could be reassigned. Therefore no code fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
