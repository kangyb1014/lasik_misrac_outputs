The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n- UtList_Extract: The MISRA rule requires inspection of the for-loop body and any functions called from it. UtList_DeleteNode calls UtList_Extract, so any for-loops (and their clauses) in UtList_Extract must be examined to determine compliance. Provide the full source of UtList_Extract so its for statements can be checked for loop counters, side effects, and modifications in the body.\n- UtListNode_t: The structure/typedef of the node is needed because for-loop clauses or bodies inside UtList_Extract may use node fields as loop counters or loop-control flags, or may modify those fields. Knowing the types (integer, boolean, pointer) and layout is necessary to judge whether a for loop uses only a single loop counter, whether the second clause uses only allowed identifiers, and whether the loop counter is modified in the body.\n- Members of UtListNode_t referenced by UtList_Extract (e.g., Data) : Exact member types and semantics (e.g., if Data is a pointer, flag, or structure) matter when deciding whether a clause uses objects that are modified in the loop body or when a member serves as a loop control flag. Include any member/type definitions used inside any for loops in UtList_Extract.\n- Global variables, macros or constants referenced inside UtList_Extract: For-loop second/third clauses must not use objects that are modified in the body; globals used in loop clauses or body must be known. Macros can rewrite loop clauses; their definitions are required to see the true expressions and any side effects.\n- All functions called (directly or transitively) by UtList_Extract: The rule says the behaviour of a for loop body includes behaviour of any functions called within the loop. If UtList_Extract calls other functions, those functions must be inspected for modifications of loop counters or other side effects that would violate the rule. (Per the provided call graph UtList_Extract has no callees, but include any transitive callees if the real code differs.)\n\nProvide these symbols (the full definitions) so the for-loop clauses and bodies can be fully analyzed for: proper initialization, absence of persistent side effects in the second clause, only modifying the loop counter in the third clause, only a single loop counter not modified in the body, and any use of loop-control flags according to the MISRA statement."
