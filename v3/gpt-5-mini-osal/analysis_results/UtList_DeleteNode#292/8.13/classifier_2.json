  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer DeleteNode is used to modify and deallocate the node (UtList_Extract likely updates node links and free(DeleteNode) deallocates it). Because the function needs to modify and/or free the object, the pointer cannot be const-qualified; therefore there is no violation of Rule 8.13."
