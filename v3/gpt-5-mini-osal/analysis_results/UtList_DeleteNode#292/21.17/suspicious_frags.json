  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In this snippet there are no direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). The only call that could internally invoke such functions is UtList_Extract(DeleteNode); that callee should be inspected for any <string.h> usage that might access memory out of bounds. The remaining fragments (the conditional check if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL) and the call free(DeleteNode);) do not call or imply use of <string.h> functions and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17. Note: the dereference DeleteNode->Data without checking DeleteNode for NULL is a potential safety/robustness issue, but it is unrelated to Rule 21.17 and thus not included as suspicious for this rule."
