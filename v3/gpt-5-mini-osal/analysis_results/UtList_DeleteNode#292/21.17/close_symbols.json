  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule analysis you must know whether any string.h call can be invoked with a pointer that refers to memory freed or with incorrect bounds. Explaination of each symbol needed:\n\n- UtListNode_t (struct definition, including Data member type): You must know the exact type of Data (char*, void*, array inside the struct, etc.) and layout of the node to determine whether Data points into the node object or to a separate buffer and whether accesses could go out of bounds.\n\n- UtListNode_t::Data (type/ownership/documentation): Ownership semantics (who allocates/frees the Data buffer) tell you whether free(DeleteNode) also invalidates the memory that string functions might later access. If Data is embedded in the same allocation as the node, freeing the node will invalidate that buffer; if Data is a separate allocation, freeing the node may not.\n\n- UtList_Extract (implementation): This call occurs before the free. You must see whether UtList_Extract modifies Data, leaves other references to Data in place, or performs any operations that could later lead to string.h usage with pointers derived from the node.\n\n- UtList_Reset (implementation): UtList_Reset is a direct caller of UtList_DeleteNode. To determine whether any string.h functions are called after deletion (or whether DeleteNode is used incorrectly), inspect Reset for further uses of node/Data or calls to functions that use string.h.\n\n- UtList_Destroy (implementation): It calls UtList_Reset (per the call graph). You need to inspect higher-level callers to see if any string.h functions are invoked on pointers that could reference the deleted node or its Data.\n\n- Node allocation/creation functions (functions that allocate/initialize UtListNode_t instances, e.g., add/create routines): These show how nodes and their Data are allocated (single allocation vs. separate buffers), which is essential to decide whether free(DeleteNode) invalidates buffers that might be used by string.h functions.\n\n- Any functions that access UtListNode_t->Data using <string.h> functions (e.g., functions that call memcpy/strcpy/strlen on Data): To prove the MISRA rule is not violated you must identify all call sites that use string.h on Data (or on pointers derived from the node) and check that the pointer/length arguments are within bounds and not pointing into freed memory.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations) allows the next agent to determine whether any future or concurrent uses of DeleteNode or its Data can lead to out-of-bounds accesses by string.h functions."
