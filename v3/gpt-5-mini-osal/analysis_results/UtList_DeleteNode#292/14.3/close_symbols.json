  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: The controlling expression is DeleteNode->Data != NULL. To determine whether that expression can be invariant you must know the exact declaration of UtListNode_t, the type of Data (e.g. pointer vs integer), and any qualifiers (const/volatile). These affect whether the expression can legally be compared to NULL and whether the member can change at runtime.\n- UtList_Extract: This function is invoked immediately before the if-test. Its implementation may modify DeleteNode->Data (set it to NULL or leave it unchanged). The body of UtList_Extract is required to know whether the controlling expression is potentially changed just prior to evaluation.\n- UtList_Reset: UtList_Reset is a caller of UtList_DeleteNode (per the call graph). Examining its implementation shows how DeleteNode is obtained/passed (e.g. sentinel/header nodes versus data nodes) and whether DeleteNode->Data has a known invariant value at the call site.\n- UtList_Destroy: UtList_Destroy calls UtList_Reset (per the call graph). Its body may create a calling context that forces DeleteNode->Data to a constant (for example when destroying a list with sentinel headers), so its implementation can reveal invariants propagated down to UtList_DeleteNode.\n- All functions/locations that initialize or assign to UtListNode_t->Data: To prove or refute that DeleteNode->Data is invariant at this point, you must inspect every place in the codebase that sets the Data member (node creation routines, push/pop functions, static/sentinel initializers). Any such initializer that always assigns the same value (e.g. always NULL for header nodes) would make the controlling expression invariant for those nodes.\n\nCollecting these symbols (type definition, the immediate callee body, callers' bodies, and all assignments/initializers to the Data field) is necessary to determine whether the controlling expression can vary at runtime or is invariant (and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated)."
