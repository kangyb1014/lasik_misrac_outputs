  "explanation": "1) UtList_Extract (declaration/definition): You must know the exact prototype and implementation of UtList_Extract to determine whether the callee can modify the pointer parameter itself. If UtList_Extract is declared to take a UtListNode_t ** (or otherwise receives the address of the pointer), it could modify the caller's pointer variable; if it takes UtListNode_t * it can only modify the object pointed-to (which is allowed by MISRA). The prototype also shows if any implicit/no prototype situation could change semantics.\n\n2) UtListNode_t (typedef/struct definition): The structure/type definition is required to verify the nature of the parameter and its members (e.g. Data), to confirm that Data is a pointer (comparison with NULL) and to reason about what operations (free, field assignments) modify: the rule distinguishes modifying the pointer variable vs. the object pointed-to.\n\n3) free (declaration / potential macro definition): Confirm the signature (void free(void *)) and ensure free has not been redefined as a macro/function with different semantics that could modify the pointer parameter itself. This establishes that calling free(DeleteNode) modifies the object pointed-to (allowed) and does not reassign the DeleteNode parameter variable (disallowed)."
