  "explanation": "No fragments modify the parameter variable DeleteNode itself. The function only: (1) passes DeleteNode to UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) (a call that does not reassign the local parameter here), (2) dereferences DeleteNode to read DeleteNode->Data, and (3) calls free(DeleteNode). Dereferencing and freeing the object pointed to are allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified); there is no assignment to the parameter (e.g., DeleteNode = ...). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing to investigate further for this rule."
