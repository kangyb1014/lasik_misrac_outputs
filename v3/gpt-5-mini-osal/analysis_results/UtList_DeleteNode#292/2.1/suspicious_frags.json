  "explanation": "I did not find any fragments that are syntactically or evidently unreachable from the provided code. Rationale:\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode: The conditional if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL) controls whether free() is called; both the true and false paths are reachable depending on runtime contents, so there is no dead code after a return nor any always-false/always-true constant condition visible here.\n\n- UtList_Extract: All statements are executed in sequence (no early return or branches). The pointer adjustments are reachable and required to unlink the node; setting ExistingNode->Next = ExistingNode and ExistingNode->Prev = ExistingNode is not dead code \u2014 it executes to leave the node in a self-referential isolated state.\n\n- UtList_Reset: The while loop condition depends on UtList_IsEmpty(TagHead). The body calls UtList_DeleteNode(TagHead->Next); there is no code after an unconditional infinite loop or an unreachable statement. Termination depends on list contents; nothing in the provided code makes the loop body unreachable.\n\n- UtList_Destroy: The for-loop iterates based on ListHead->NumberOfTags; neither the loop body nor the subsequent free(ListHead) is obviously unreachable. There are no statements after an unconditional return or infinite loop.\n\nTo fully prove absence of unreachable code project-wide, implementations of UtList_IsEmpty and any code that initializes the list structures would need review; however, based on the supplied fragments there are no clear instances of unreachable code that require investigation."
