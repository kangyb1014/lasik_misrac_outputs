  "explanation": "UtList_Extract \u2014 UtList_DeleteNode\u2019s only callee. To determine whether UtList_DeleteNode violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls you must examine every function it calls (and the transitive closure of those callees) to see if any path returns to UtList_DeleteNode. Concretely, you need the body/signature of UtList_Extract to check whether it (directly or via other callees) calls UtList_DeleteNode. Per the provided static call graph UtList_Extract has no further callees; therefore no additional symbols are required unless analysis of UtList_Extract reveals other callees, in which case those callee symbols would also need to be added."
