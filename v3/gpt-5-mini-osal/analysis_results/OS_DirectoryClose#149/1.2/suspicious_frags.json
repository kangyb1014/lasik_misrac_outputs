  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and the related typedefs for use of compiler-specific language extensions. The snippet contains only: standard C function and block scope, standard typedefs (int32 mapping to int32_t, osal_id_t to an unsigned integral type), a forward declaration typedef for a struct, macro use (OS_SUCCESS), and ordinary function calls and macros as arguments. There are no compiler-extension tokens or constructs present such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, label-as-value (&&label), inline assembly, compiler-specific pragmas, Microsoft-specific keywords, GCC/Clang builtin intrinsics, or other documented compiler extensions. The use of identifiers or macros (e.g. OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE) does not by itself indicate a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the given code."
