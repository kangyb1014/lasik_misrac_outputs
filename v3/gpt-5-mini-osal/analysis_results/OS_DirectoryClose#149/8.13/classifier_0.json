  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call site itself does not demonstrate a violation. Whether Rule 8.13 is violated depends on the declaration/implementation of OS_DirClose_Impl. If OS_DirClose_Impl is declared as taking a pointer to non-const (e.g. OS_object_token_t *token) but does not modify the object, then the function's parameter should be const-qualified and that would be a Rule 8.13 violation in the function declaration/definition. If OS_DirClose_Impl needs to modify the token (or is declared to take a pointer to const), then there is no violation. The provided fragment alone is insufficient to prove a violation."
