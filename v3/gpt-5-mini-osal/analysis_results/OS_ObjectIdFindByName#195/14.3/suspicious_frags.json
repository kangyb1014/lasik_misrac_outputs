  "explanation": "No loop controlling expressions appear in the provided function or related snippets. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (typically for/while/do-while loop conditions). The code contains only if statements and macro-expanded if checks (ARGCHECK and LENGTHCHECK) and a simple if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) after a function call. None of these are invariant: - ARGCHECK(name, ...) tests the runtime pointer 'name' (not a compile-time constant). - LENGTHCHECK(memchr(name,'\\0',OS_MAX_API_NAME), ...) depends on the runtime contents of 'name' (memchr result is not invariant even though OS_MAX_API_NAME is a constant). - if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) depends on the result of OS_ObjectIdGetByName and so is not invariant. There are no do-while or while/for loops with constant conditions in the shown code, and thus nothing that would trigger Rule 14.3 (the allowed exceptions for intentional infinite loops or the do-while constant-false integer-constant-expression are also not applicable). Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 14.3 based on the provided code."
