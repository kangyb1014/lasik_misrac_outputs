  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: typedef-based integer types (e.g. int32, osal_id_t), ordinary function calls, pointer dereference, and macro invocations (ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL). Macro invocations themselves are standard C and their definitions are not shown here \u2014 nothing in the shown usage indicates a compiler-specific extension (such as GNU statement-expressions, __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, MSVC-specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions). Declarations appear at the start of the function (compatible with both C89 and later), and there are no inline assembly, compiler pragmas, or extended token usages. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
