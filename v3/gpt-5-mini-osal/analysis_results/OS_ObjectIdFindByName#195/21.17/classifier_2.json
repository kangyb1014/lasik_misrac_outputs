  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: the function signature alone does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore, based on the provided fragment there is no access beyond object bounds caused by string handling functions. (Note: a violation could occur elsewhere if ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, or OS_ObjectIdGetByName internally use functions like strcpy/strlen/memcpy without ensuring the 'name' buffer is null-terminated and within OS_MAX_API_NAME; that would be outside the scope of this fragment.)"
