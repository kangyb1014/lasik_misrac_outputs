  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, ...) is implemented using an unbounded string.h routine such as strlen (or strcpy/strncpy/strcat/etc.) it can read past the end of the object referenced by name when name is not a NUL-terminated string or the buffer is shorter than expected. For example, if the caller passes a pointer to a char buffer that is not NUL-terminated (or points near the end of accessible memory), strlen(name) inside LENGTHCHECK will scan beyond the buffer bounds, violating Rule 21.17."
