  "scenario": "The call itself does not directly invoke any <string.h> function. Given the prior ARGCHECK(name, ...) and LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, ...) guards, this call does not by itself violate Rule 21.17 provided those checks guarantee name is non-NULL and within the expected maximum length and OS_ObjectIdGetByName performs bounds\u2011checked use of the string. A concrete violation scenario would be: OS_ObjectIdGetByName internally uses a string function (e.g. strcpy, strcat or memcpy) to copy 'name' into a destination buffer that is smaller than strlen(name)+1 (or otherwise ignores the supplied length), causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. In that case Rule 21.17 would be violated."
