  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and uses where the pointed-to type could be const-qualified. The only pointer in this function is StubPtr and its uses are the assignment from UT_GetStubEntry and the call to UT_ClearStubEntry; these are the relevant fragments to investigate. Other fragments do not need investigation under Rule 8.13: the function signature (void UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)) has no pointer parameters; the if (StubPtr != NULL) check is only a null check and does not affect qualification; the function return type is void and not subject to pointer const-qualification. No other pointer variables or pointer-producing expressions appear in this code, so they need not be examined for this rule."
