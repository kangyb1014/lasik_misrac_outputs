  "explanation": "The function body contains only comments and a single return statement returning the constant OS_SUCCESS; there are no control-flow constructs (if, switch, for, while, do-while) in this function to have a controlling expression. The related symbols shown (OS_SUCCESS macro and typedefs) are not control constructs and the return of a constant is not a controlling expression. Therefore Rule 14.3 (invariant controlling expressions) is not applicable and no fragments require investigation."
