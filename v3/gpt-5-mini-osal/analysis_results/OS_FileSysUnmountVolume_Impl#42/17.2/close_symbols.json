  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion (the MISRA rule), you must examine callers that could form a call cycle back to the target. OS_unmount is an immediate caller of the target, so its body and its callees must be inspected for any path that leads back to OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (or to OS_unmount itself). The listed symbols are the functions OS_unmount calls (per the static call graph); each must be analyzed (and their transitive callees) to see whether they (directly or indirectly) call OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl or OS_unmount, which would create recursion. Each entry is therefore required because it is a potential link in a call chain that could close a cycle: if any of them (or functions they call) call back into OS_unmount or OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl, the MISRA rule would be violated. (No non-function symbols\u2014e.g., OS_SUCCESS or the token type\u2014are needed to decide recursion.)"
