Since the call has no side\u2011effects and its removal (or replacing it by setting return_code = OS_SUCCESS) would not change program behaviour, this constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The function is indeed a pure no-op that always returns OS_SUCCESS, so by the literal definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour) it would qualify. However MISRA Rule 2.2 allows retaining such code when there is an intended, documented rationale (e.g. for portability/abstraction or timing semantics). In this case the function includes an explanatory comment that explicitly documents why it is a no-op (POSIX mounting/unmounting not implemented, retained for backward compatibility). Furthermore this routine is clearly an abstraction point that may have non\u2011trivial implementations on other platforms/builds. Because the intent is documented in the source, the presence of the no\u2011op implementation is justified and does not constitute a MISRA 2.2 violation in this project. If stricter justification is desired, the project could add an explicit MISRA justification comment or central justification for platform stubs, but as given the agent A report is not correct."
