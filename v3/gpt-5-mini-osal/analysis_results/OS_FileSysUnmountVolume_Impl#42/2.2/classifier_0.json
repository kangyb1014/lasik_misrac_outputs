Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * NOTE: Mounting/Unmounting on POSIX is not implemented.\n     * For backward compatibility this call must return success.\n     *\n     * This is a no-op.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is a deliberate API compatibility stub (a no-op that returns OS_SUCCESS) used by OS_unmount. It defines the required behavior for unmount on this platform and removing or altering the symbol could change program behavior (or break linking/portability). Therefore it is not 'dead code' as defined by MISRA C Rule 2.2."
