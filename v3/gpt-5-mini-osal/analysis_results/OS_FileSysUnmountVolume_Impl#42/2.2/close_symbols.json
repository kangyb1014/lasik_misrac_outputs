  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to evaluate the MISRA dead-code question for OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl:\n\n- OS_unmount\n  - This is the direct caller (per the static call graph). To decide whether removing or changing OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl would alter program behavior you must inspect how OS_unmount uses the callee: whether it relies on its return value, its side effects, or whether OS_unmount conditionally calls alternative implementations. If OS_unmount ignores the return or has fallback behavior then the impl might be dead; if it propagates the result or depends on side effects then it is not.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - The function always returns this constant. Understanding the semantic meaning of OS_SUCCESS (value, documentation, and how callers react to it) is required to know whether returning a constant success has behavioral effect. If callers branch on specific success codes or map them to further actions, removal could change behavior even without side effects.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - This is the declared parameter type. Inspecting the type may reveal whether passing a token has observable semantics (e.g., reference-counting, implicit side-effects, or aliasing rules) or whether the signature is used in a function-pointer table. It also helps determine if the function matches an interface required by callers or dispatch tables.\n\n- OS file-system implementation registration/dispatch symbol(s)\n  - Many OS implementations expose per-filesystem operation tables or registration APIs (dispatch tables, vtables, or registration functions) that may hold pointers to implementations like OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. If this impl is stored in a dispatch table used at runtime, removing it could change behavior (different implementation chosen, NULL pointer, compile/link error). You need to examine any such registration or table symbols to see whether this function is referenced indirectly (not just by direct callers in the static call graph).\n\n- linker/export/weak-symbol metadata for OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl\n  - Linker-level metadata (symbol export lists, weak/strong alias attributes, or build glue) can make a function reachable even if static callers in the scanned module are few. For example, the implementation might be provided as a default weak symbol intended to be overridden by a board-specific implementation; removing it could alter behavior or break linking. To conclude whether the code is dead you must check symbol visibility/aliasing and whether other translation units or the runtime use this symbol by name.\n\nIn summary: to determine whether this implementation is truly dead code you must analyze its direct caller (OS_unmount) for use of the return and side-effects, the meaning of the returned constant (OS_SUCCESS), the parameter type for interface conformance, any registration/dispatch tables that may reference it indirectly, and the linkage/visibility information that could make it reachable outside the static call graph."
