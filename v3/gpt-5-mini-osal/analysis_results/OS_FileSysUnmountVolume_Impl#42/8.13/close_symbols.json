  "explanation": "- OS_object_token_t (typedef/struct definition): The core symbol. You must know whether OS_object_token_t is a struct, an alias to a pointer type, or an opaque/incomplete type. The exact declaration determines what the const in \u2018const OS_object_token_t *token\u2019 actually qualifies (the pointed-to object vs. a typedef\u2019d pointer), and whether the pointed-at data can/should be const-qualified per MISRA.\n\n- Underlying typedefs used by OS_object_token_t (if any): If OS_object_token_t is a typedef to another type (for example to a pointer type or to another typedef), the const semantics can be unintuitive (const applies to the typedef name). Knowing the underlying typedef chain is required to decide whether the current const placement enforces immutability of the intended object.\n\n- OS_unmount (declaration + implementation): OS_unmount is the caller of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. Inspecting its implementation shows how the token is created, passed, and whether the caller (or other code in the same call sequence) expects to mutate the pointee. That may affect whether the callee\u2019s parameter must be non-const for compatibility or whether const is appropriate.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (prototype), OS_ObjectIdRelease (prototype), OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch (prototype): These functions appear in the caller\u2019s call graph. Their parameter types (whether they take OS_object_token_t * or const OS_object_token_t *) and how they use the token indicate whether the token is commonly passed to APIs that require mutation. This helps determine API-wide const-consistency: even if this callee does not modify the pointee, passing a const-qualified pointer here might be inconsistent with other APIs that expect a mutable token, which is relevant to MISRA guidance about const-correctness across interfaces."
