  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses compiler language extensions, the analyzer must inspect the actual definitions referenced in the signature and return statement: \n\n- int32: This is a typedef/alias \u2014 it may be implemented using a compiler-specific extension (for example __int32, extended integer types, or non-standard typedefs). Confirming its definition ensures no extension is hiding behind the name.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: This type could be a struct, union, pointer, or a macro built using compiler extensions (e.g. typeof, attribute-packed, bitfield extensions). Its definition must be checked for any non\u2011standard language constructs.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: This macro/constant could be defined using extension syntax (e.g. asm labels, GCC statement-expressions, or other nonstandard constructs). The actual macro/constant definition must be inspected.\n\n- OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (declaration/prototype in header): The prototype in the header might include function attributes, nonstandard qualifiers, or visibility pragmas (e.g. __attribute__((...)), __declspec) not visible in the implementation. The header must be checked for such extensions.\n\n- Any macros/attributes used in the definitions of the above (e.g. __attribute__, compiler-specific typedef macros): Some definitions hide extensions behind intermediary macros (e.g. OSAL_API, PACKED, ALIGN). Those macros must be examined to detect use of documented compiler extensions.\n\nTogether these symbols cover the only places where language extensions could be introduced for this function (the return type, parameter type, return-value macro, and any attributes/macros on the declaration/definitions)."
