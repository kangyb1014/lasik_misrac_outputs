  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code. The function signature (using a typedef\u2019d int32 and a typedef\u2019d struct pointer with const) is standard C; the forward typedef of OS_object_token_t and the typedef alias int32 are ordinary C constructs (not compiler extensions). The OS_SUCCESS macro is a plain integer macro. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (for example: no __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, nonstandard pragmas, or other vendor-specific extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
