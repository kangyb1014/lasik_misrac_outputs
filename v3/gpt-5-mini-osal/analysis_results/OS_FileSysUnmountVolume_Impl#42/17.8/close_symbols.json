  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t (typedef/struct definition): The exact declaration of OS_object_token_t is required to determine the true type and const\u2011qualification applied to the parameter. The MISRA rule concerns modification of the parameter itself (the pointer value) vs. the object it points to. If OS_object_token_t is a plain struct type, 'const OS_object_token_t * token' means a pointer to const object (pointer itself mutable). If OS_object_token_t is itself a typedef to a pointer type, the const placement can have different meaning (e.g. typedef T * OS_object_token_t makes 'const OS_object_token_t *' into pointer-to-(pointer) where const may apply to the inner pointer). Knowing the precise typedef/struct removes this ambiguity. \n\n2) Any typedefs or pointer typedefs used inside OS_object_token_t: If OS_object_token_t is composed from other typedefs (for example a typedef to a pointer or to another typedef that carries const), those underlying typedefs determine whether the token parameter is a pointer that could be modified or whether the const applies to the pointer itself. MISRA analysis must inspect those underlying symbols to be sure the function does not modify the parameter. \n\n3) Header/declaration of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl: A prototype or header declaration (or any macros/attributes applied at declaration time) may alter the apparent parameter type (via macros, qualifiers, or attributes). To be certain the parameter is interpreted the same way in all translation units and that no macro transforms the parameter into a const pointer (or vice versa), the external declaration must be checked."
