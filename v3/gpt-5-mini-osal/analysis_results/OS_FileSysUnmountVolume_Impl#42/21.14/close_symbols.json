  "explanation": "OS_SUCCESS \u2014 The function returns OS_SUCCESS; verify this is a plain constant/macro and not an expression or wrapper that could call memcmp (or another string-comparison routine). OS_object_token_t \u2014 The function signature uses this type; confirm its definition does not trigger any hidden operations (e.g. macros or inline accessor functions) that could perform memcmp on null-terminated strings. memcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings; include the symbol to check whether this function or any macros expanded into it are referenced in the translation unit or via OS_SUCCESS/type definitions. OS_unmount \u2014 The caller of this function (present in the static call graph); include it to ensure there is no inlining, wrapper, or macro interaction from the caller side that would change the effective body of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (for example, if build-time transformations or callers introduce comparisons that could be attributed to this implementation)."
