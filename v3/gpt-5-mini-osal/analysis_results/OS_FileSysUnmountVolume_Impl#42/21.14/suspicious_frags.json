  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl and the related OS_unmount implementation. None of the shown code fragments contains a call to memcmp or any explicit comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp. OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is a simple no-op that returns OS_SUCCESS. The other visible operations in OS_unmount are parameter checking via the OS_CHECK_STRING macro, object lookup (OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch), flag bitwise checks, and calls to OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl and OS_ObjectIdRelease \u2014 none of which in the provided listings use memcmp.\n\nTherefore there are no suspicious fragments in the supplied code to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: some identifiers shown (macros and helper functions such as OS_CHECK_STRING, OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint, OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and OS_ObjectIdRelease) are not defined in the provided snippets. If any of those macros/functions internally use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, they could be violations; to investigate those, please provide their definitions. Without those definitions, I cannot identify any memcmp-related issues in the given code."
