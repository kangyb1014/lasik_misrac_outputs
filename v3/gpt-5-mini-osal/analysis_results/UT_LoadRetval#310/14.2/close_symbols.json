Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA \"for loop shall be well\u2011formed\" analysis of UT_LoadRetval:\n\n- UT_GENRE_SIZE: This macro is used in the switch controlling flow. Macros can expand to arbitrary code (including for loops or expressions that introduce/modify loop counters). You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not contain or expand to any for loop or side effects that would affect loop\u2011wellformedness.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER, UT_ValueGenre_FLOAT, UT_ValueGenre_POINTER: These enumeration/constant symbols are arguments to UT_GENRE_SIZE. Their definitions may affect how the macro expands (e.g., via other macros or conditional compilation). Confirm they are simple constants and not macro functions that introduce loops or side effects.\n\n- UT_RetvalBuf_t: The struct type of Buf. Its member types (Integer, FloatingPt, Ptr) must be inspected to ensure the assignments in each case are simple data moves and that any member access does not invoke functions or macros that contain for loops or modify external loop counters.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The type of ValueGenre passed to UT_GENRE_SIZE. Its definition may include macros or typedefs that could affect macro expansion; inspect to ensure it is an ordinary enum/typedef and not a macro alias that expands to code with loops.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: Called in the default branch (return UtAssert_Failed(...)). UtAssert_Failed may be a macro or function; it could expand to or call code that contains for loops or modifies objects that could be used as loop counters in surrounding code. You must inspect its definition/implementation for any for loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph as a callee (likely via UtAssert_Failed). Its implementation must be examined because functions called (directly or indirectly) from the target are part of the behaviour of any loop body in the target. If UtAssert_GetContext or functions it calls contain for loops or modify global objects, that could affect compliance if the target contained loops.\n\n- int8, int16, int32, int64: The typedefs underlying these integer names (and their sizes) are used in sizeof() in the case labels and in the casts/assignments. Verify they are simple integer typedefs and not macros or types with overloaded behaviour (e.g., inline functions/macros) that could hide loop constructs or side effects.\n\nNote: UT_LoadRetval itself contains no for loops. The symbols above must be checked because macros (UT_GENRE_SIZE, UtAssert_Failed) or called routines (UtAssert_GetContext) could expand to or call code with for loops or with side effects that would interact with any loop counters if the target did contain loops. Inspecting these symbols is sufficient to determine whether any hidden/indirect for loops exist or whether called code could invalidate MISRA for\u2011loop constraints."
