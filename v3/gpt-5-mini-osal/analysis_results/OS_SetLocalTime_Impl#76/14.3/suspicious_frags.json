  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is invariant. The only conditional is\nif (Status == 0)\nand Status is assigned from the runtime call Status = clock_settime(...), so its value depends on the execution environment and can vary (success or failure). The time-field assignments call OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(*time_struct) and OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(*time_struct), both depend on the input time_struct (runtime data) and are therefore not constant. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions, and the use of constants (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, CLOCK_REALTIME) occurs only in assignments/returns and does not create an invariant controlling expression. For these reasons no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
