  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is declared as a pointer to const (const OS_time_t *time_struct) and is only dereferenced for read access (OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(*time_struct), OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(*time_struct)). The pointer itself is never modified or reassigned, nor is any pointer arithmetic performed on it. The object referred to is not written to within this function. The call to clock_settime uses the address of a local struct (&TimeSp), not the parameter. Therefore there is no violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
