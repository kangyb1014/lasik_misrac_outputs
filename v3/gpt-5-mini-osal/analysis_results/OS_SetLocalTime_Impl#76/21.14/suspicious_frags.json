  "explanation": "No occurrence of the C library function memcmp or any string comparison of null-terminated strings is present in the provided target or additional code. The function OS_SetLocalTime_Impl only computes integer tick/second and nanosecond values, fills a struct timespec, and calls clock_settime. The additional symbols/macros (OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds, OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart, OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, and the OS_time_t typedef) operate on integer tick values or map to clock constants; none perform or wrap memcmp calls or manipulate C strings. Therefore Rule 21.14 (memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings) does not apply to any fragment of the provided code."
