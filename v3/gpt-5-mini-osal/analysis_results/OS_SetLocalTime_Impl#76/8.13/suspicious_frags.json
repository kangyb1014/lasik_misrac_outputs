  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 were found. The only pointer in the function signature is 'const OS_time_t *time_struct', which is already const-qualified. There are no local pointer variables declared. The address-of operator is used once: '&TimeSp' is passed to clock_settime, which (per POSIX) takes a 'const struct timespec *' parameter; passing the address of a non-const automatic object to a function expecting a pointer-to-const is allowed and does not violate the rule. The dereference '*time_struct' is used only to obtain values and the parameter is const-qualified. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for Rule 8.13."
