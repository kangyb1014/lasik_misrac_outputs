  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no use of compiler-specific keywords or attributes such as __attribute__, __asm, __typeof__, __extension__, __int128, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or other known vendor/GNU/Clang extensions.\n- The OS_DEBUG macro uses __VA_ARGS__, which is a standard C99 feature (variadic macros), not a compiler extension. The code does not use the GCC/Clang extension token-pasting of empty __VA_ARGS__ (##__VA_ARGS__).\n- All identifiers and declarations in the function are standard C (local variable declarations, control flow, function calls). The extern declarations, typedefs (int32/uint32 from int32_t/uint32_t), and POSIX types/functions (mode_t, uid_t, gid_t, open, fstat, fchmod, strerror, errno) are library/OS interfaces, not language extensions.\n- There is no inline assembly, no nonstandard statement forms, no designated-initializer extensions, no zero-length arrays, and no other syntactic constructs that are commonly documented as compiler extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
