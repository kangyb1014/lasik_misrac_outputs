This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "strerror \u2014 The target calls strerror(errno) and prints its result. To determine whether any <string.h> routine could access out-of-bounds memory here you must know the exact behavior of strerror on the target platform (how it indexes message tables, whether it can be passed an out-of-range errno that would lead to an out-of-bounds access, whether it returns a pointer to a static NUL-terminated buffer or uses thread-local buffers, etc.).\n\nOS_DEBUG (macro/function and its implementation) \u2014 The function passes the strerror() result into OS_DEBUG with a \"%s\" format. OS_DEBUG's implementation may itself call string-handling functions (e.g. snprintf, strcpy, strcat, strlen). To check for any violation of the MISRA <string.h> rule you need the OS_DEBUG implementation to see which string.h functions are used and how the passed pointers/strings are handled (copies, length assumptions, destination buffer sizes).\n\nOS_chmod \u2014 The static call graph shows OS_chmod calls OS_FileChmod_Impl. To ensure no indirect misuse of <string.h> (e.g. if OS_chmod constructs or validates local_path or passes a non-NUL-terminated buffer), you must inspect OS_chmod to see how local_path is created/validated and whether it guarantees a proper C string (NUL termination and length constraints). This addresses the caller-side contract for pointer parameters that string functions rely on.\n\nerrno \u2014 strerror is called with errno and the code checks errno against ENOTSUP, ENOSYS, EROFS. Understanding where errno values can originate (and whether errno can be an unexpected/invalid value) is necessary to judge if passing errno to strerror could provoke out-of-bounds accesses inside strerror on some implementations.\n\nopen \u2014 The code passes local_path to open(\u2026, local_path, \u2026). Although open is not a <string.h> function, the way the path is consumed/validated by the system or by wrappers may affect whether the buffer is a well-formed, NUL-terminated string. Inspecting open (or any wrapper used in this platform) helps determine whether local_path can ever be a non-terminated or out-of-bounds pointer when later passed to string-handling routines (directly or via OS_DEBUG/strerror)."
