  "explanation": "open \u2014 require the prototype to confirm the pathname parameter type (should be const char *) so the use of local_path (const char *) is correct and no dropped const occurs. fstat \u2014 need the prototype to confirm the second parameter is struct stat * (non-const) so that passing &st (non-const) is appropriate; this explains why the buffer is non-const. fchmod \u2014 prototype needed to confirm it takes non-pointer mode_t and does not imply any pointer constness issues. close \u2014 to confirm prototype and that fd handling does not involve pointer constness. strerror \u2014 its return type must be known (historically char *) to determine whether a const-qualified return would be appropriate; passing its return into OS_DEBUG may reveal a constness mismatch. errno \u2014 type and linkage required because strerror(errno) is used; errno itself is not a pointer but is used in calls that return pointer-to-char. struct stat \u2014 full definition (member types st_mode, st_uid, st_gid) is required to check which members are addresses/pointers (none are) and to validate that fields used require non-const access (st_mode is modified). mode_t \u2014 typedef needed to ensure st_mode operations are on non-pointer integer types and do not mask any pointer constness issues. OS_DEBUG \u2014 macro/function prototype needed to know the expected constness of its string and argument parameters (e.g., does it take const char *?), to detect any mismatches when passing strerror(...) or local_path. OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID / OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID \u2014 definitions and types required to confirm comparisons with st.st_uid/st_gid do not involve pointers and to ensure no hidden pointer-typed globals are compared. OS_READ_ONLY, OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE \u2014 constants needed to confirm access_mode comparisons and that no pointer conversions are implied. uint32, int32 \u2014 typedefs for the parameter types so it is clear they are integer types (not pointer aliases), ensuring the only pointer in the function signature is local_path which is already const-qualified.\n\nNote: The focus is on symbols that affect pointer types/constness in this routine (function prototypes, return types, struct/type definitions, and macros that accept string pointers). Other macros/return-code constants (e.g., OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) do not affect pointer constness and were omitted for brevity."
