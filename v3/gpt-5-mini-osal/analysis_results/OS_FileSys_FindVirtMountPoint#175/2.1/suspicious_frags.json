  "explanation": "No unreachable-code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n\n- The early return for filesys->flags not having OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL is reachable: the flags value can legitimately be set or cleared for different records, so both the return and the subsequent code path may execute at runtime.\n\n- OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt)) can return any value in the inclusive range [0, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt)]. Thus the checks mplen == 0 and mplen >= sizeof(...) are potentially true at runtime (mplen == sizeof(...) occurs when no NUL is found within the array), so the branch that returns false is reachable.\n\n- The strncmp() comparison can succeed or fail depending on the caller-supplied target string and the stored virtual_mountpt, so both the return path and the continuation to the final return are reachable.\n\n- The final return (target[mplen] == '/' || target[mplen] == 0) is reached whenever the earlier conditions are false (i.e., the record is virtual-mounted, the virtual_mountpt length is in-range and non-zero, and strncmp matched). Accessing target[mplen] is consistent with that match: if strncmp matched up to mplen, then target has at least mplen bytes and target[mplen] is defined (it can be '/' or the terminating NUL). Therefore this line is reachable and not dead code.\n\nNotes (not claims of unreachable code): possible runtime/undefined-behavior concerns exist outside the scope of Rule 2.1 (for example, invalid token->obj_idx indexing OS_filesys_table or caller-supplied invalid target pointers), but these are not instances of unreachable code and thus are not included as suspicious for Rule 2.1."
