First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for\u2011statements are present in the provided function, so there are no in\u2011place for loops that require investigation against MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The rule applies to syntactic for statements (and the behaviour of functions called within such statements); since this translation unit fragment contains no for statements, nothing in this code fragment directly violates or needs assessment against Rule 14.2.\n\nNotes to reviewers (why other fragments were not flagged):\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token): This is a macro/function call that appears on its own line. Because there is no for statement here, Rule 14.2 does not apply to this line as written. If the macro expansion/definition contains a for statement, that definition should be inspected separately, but the call site in this function is not itself a for loop.\n- OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt)) and strncmp(target, filesys->virtual_mountpt, mplen): These are function calls; they are not for statements in this function. If their implementations (or macro definitions) contain for loops, those implementations must be reviewed for compliance, but the call sites in this function do not trigger Rule 14.2 checks.\n- Array/indexing usage (target[mplen]), casts ((const char *)ref), and conditional/return statements: None introduce a for loop and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.2.\n\nRecommendation: If you want Rule 14.2 checked project\u2011wide, inspect the definitions/implementations of the invoked macros/functions (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_strnlen, strncmp, etc.) because any for loops inside those definitions would need to be reviewed for well\u2011formedness."
