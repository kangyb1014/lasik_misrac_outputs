  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. In this function the local pointer filesys is only used to read members (flags and virtual_mountpt) and is never used to modify the pointed object. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. It is possible here to make the pointer const (for example: const OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...);). Assigning the address of a non-const object to a pointer-to-const is allowed in C, so there is no technical obstacle from the macro/table definitions. Therefore the report that this code violates Rule 8.13 is correct. A simple fix is to declare filesys as a pointer-to-const to preserve const-correctness."
