If the member OS_static_symbol_record_t::Name is declared as a non-const char * (i.e. mutable pointer to char), this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible. The code shown only reads the symbol name (strcmp comparisons) and the OS_SymbolLookup_Static prototype already takes const char * for its SymbolName and ModuleName parameters, so the call sites themselves are fine. The agent's claim depends on the declaration of the static-symbol and common-record name members (OS_static_symbol_record_t::Name and OS_common_record_t::name_entry). If those members are declared as a non-const char * (or mutable char array) but are never modified, then they should indeed be declared const char * (or const char[]/const-qualified) and leaving them non-const would be a violation of 8.13. However, the provided snippets do not include the declarations of those members, so you cannot definitively conclude a rule violation from the shown code alone. Conclusion: the report is plausible but not verifiable with the supplied code \u2014 verify the declarations of the name members. If they are non-const yet only used read-only, change them to point to const; if they are intended to be mutable or are arrays that must be modified, keep as-is and document justification."
