The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the declaration and the unconditional retrieval/assignment of the record are flagged because the record value is only used in the error path (when the low-level OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl fails). As written the code always performs the table lookup and assignment even when the low-level lookup succeeds; removing or deferring that lookup to the failure branch would not change program behaviour and therefore warrants investigation for possible dead code.\n\nOther fragments were not selected because they perform observable effects or are required for correct behaviour: the OS_CHECK_POINTER macro enforces runtime pointer validation (cannot be removed safely), the OS_ObjectIdGetById/OS_ObjectIdRelease calls manage token/locking and side effects, the call to OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl performs the primary symbol lookup, the static-symbol search (OS_SymbolLookup_Static) is executed only as a fallback and its result affects the return value, and all return_code/staticsym_status assignments affect control flow or return values. None of those appear to be operations that could be removed without changing program behaviour, so they need not be investigated under Rule 2.2."
