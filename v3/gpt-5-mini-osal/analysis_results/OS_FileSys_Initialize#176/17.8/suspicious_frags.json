  "explanation": "No code fragments in this function modify the function parameters themselves (i.e., none of the pointer variables are assigned to, incremented/decremented, or have their addresses taken and passed for modification). Specific checks:\n- address (char *): only read and copied into filesys->address (filesys->address = address;). This copies the value but does not modify the parameter variable address itself.\n- fsdevname and fsvolname (const char *): only read (OS_CHECK_STRING macros, index access fsdevname[0], fsvolname[0], and passed to functions/macros). The code uses fsvolname as source in strncpy to copy into filesys->volume_name; it does not modify fsvolname.\n- blocksize, numblocks, should_format: scalar parameters are only read and stored into filesys fields or used in control flow; they are not modified.\n- Function/macro calls (OS_CHECK_STRING, OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_OBJECT_INIT, OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl, etc.) are invoked with the pointer values but there is no use of the address-of operator (&) on the pointer parameters nor any assignment to those parameters in this function.\n\nTherefore, there are no apparent violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code fragment. If further scrutiny is desired, the implementations of the macros/functions used (OS_CHECK_STRING, OS_OBJECT_INIT, etc.) could be inspected to confirm they do not expand/operate in a way that assigns to the parameter identifiers; however, within this function body itself no parameter modification occurs."
