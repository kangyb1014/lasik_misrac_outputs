  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis:\n\n- strncmp\n  - The target function calls strncmp(GroupPtr, \"Test_\", 5). To determine whether this use can access bytes beyond the bounds of the object pointed to by GroupPtr you must know the exact prototype and semantics of strncmp (signature and that it compares up to n characters) and whether it may read up to n bytes from its first argument. This determines if calling strncmp with n = 5 can legally read from GroupPtr when GroupName is shorter than 5 characters or not NUL-terminated within the first 5 bytes.\n\n- snprintf\n  - The function uses snprintf(CompleteTestName, sizeof(CompleteTestName), \"%s.%s\", GroupPtr, TestPtr). Although snprintf is in <stdio.h> (not <string.h>), its buffer-write behavior is relevant to whether the function can produce a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write. The analyzer needs the prototype and standard guarantees of snprintf (maximum bytes written relative to the supplied size, truncation and NUL-termination behavior) to conclude whether CompleteTestName can be written out-of-bounds.\n\n- CompleteTestName (local buffer size = 128)\n  - The size of the destination buffer used by snprintf is required to know the bound that must not be exceeded. This lets the analyzer compute whether the concatenation/format \"%s.%s\" of GroupPtr and TestPtr (after pointer adjustments) can exceed the 128-byte object.\n\n- GroupName (caller-supplied C string pointer; null-termination and allocated length)\n  - The safety of all pointer dereferences and of strncmp depends on the property that GroupName points to a valid NUL-terminated character array of sufficient length. The analyzer must know (or assume/verify) whether GroupName is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated and how many bytes are valid to read; otherwise dereferencing GroupPtr or reading up to 5 bytes in strncmp could access beyond the object.\n\n- TestName (caller-supplied C string pointer; null-termination and allocated length)\n  - Similar to GroupName: the function advances and decrements TestPtr and dereferences *TestPtr in loops. The analyzer must know that TestName is a valid NUL-terminated string and the allocation bounds so it can determine whether these pointer operations and the later snprintf reading TestPtr are within the object.\n\n- \"Test_\" string literal (length 6 including terminating NUL; call uses n = 5)\n  - The literal and the chosen n = 5 are needed to reason about the strncmp call: the call compares up to 5 characters (not including the terminating NUL). Knowing the literal length confirms that the second argument is long enough for the requested compare length and that the comparison does not itself read beyond the literal, so any potential out-of-bounds would be from GroupPtr, not the literal.\n\nNotes for the next analyzer: with these symbols and their semantics you can determine whether any reads (the strncmp call and the pointer dereferences in the loops) or writes (snprintf into CompleteTestName) can legally access memory beyond the objects referenced by the pointer parameters per the MISRA rule. If caller-side guarantees (GroupName/TestName are valid NUL-terminated arrays of sufficient length) are not present, the code cannot be proven safe with respect to that rule."
