  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The pointer parameters (Test, Setup, Teardown, GroupName, TestName) are only read and/or passed through; the code does not assign to them. GroupPtr and TestPtr are local pointer variables that are initialized from GroupName/TestName and subsequently incremented/decremented \u2014 these are local copies, not the parameter objects themselves. The pointer parameters themselves are never reassigned or altered, and the objects they point to are only read (no modification). Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
