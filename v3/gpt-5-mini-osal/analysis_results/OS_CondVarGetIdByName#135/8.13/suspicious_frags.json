  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter var_name is already const-qualified (const char *), so it complies with the rule; return_code is not a pointer type; the other macro call OS_CHECK_POINTER(var_name) and uses of var_name are consistent with the const qualification; no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions appear in the function body that would be candidates for const-qualification."
