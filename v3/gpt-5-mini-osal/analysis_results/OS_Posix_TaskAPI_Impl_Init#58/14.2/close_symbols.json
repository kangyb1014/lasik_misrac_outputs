  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to check the MISRA \"well-formed for\" rule for the loop \"for (sig = SIGRTMIN; sig <= SIGRTMAX; ++sig)\"): \n\n- SIGRTMIN\n  - The first clause initializes the loop counter using SIGRTMIN. MISRA requires that the first clause set the loop counter. You must know whether SIGRTMIN is a simple constant/macro or expands to a function or expression with side effects (which could violate the rule).\n\n- SIGRTMAX\n  - The second clause (sig <= SIGRTMAX) uses SIGRTMAX. MISRA requires the second clause have no persistent side effects and only use the loop counter and optional loop control flags (not objects modified in the loop body). You must know whether SIGRTMAX is a pure constant or an expression/function with side effects or reads mutable state.\n\n- __libc_current_sigrtmin and __libc_current_sigrtmax\n  - On some platforms (glibc) SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX are implemented as function-like macros that call internal functions (e.g. __libc_current_sigrtmin/__libc_current_sigrtmax). If SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX expand to such functions, you need their definitions/semantics to determine whether the second clause or first clause has side effects or reads objects that might be modified by the loop body or by called functions.\n\n- sigaddset\n  - This is the function called in the loop body. MISRA treats the behaviour of the loop body as including any called functions. You must know the prototype/semantics of sigaddset (does it take the signo by value, does it modify any global objects or the loop counter?) to ensure the loop counter is not modified by the body and that the body does not modify objects that are referenced in the for-clauses.\n\n- sigset_t\n  - The type of the mask object passed to sigaddset. Knowing the type clarifies what objects are modified by the body (the sigset_t instance) and whether those objects are referenced in the loop clauses (they are not). Also needed to assess aliasing/side-effect concerns.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - The loop body modifies POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask. The MISRA rule forbids the second/third clauses from using objects that are modified in the loop body; to check this you need the definition of the POSIX_GlobalVars structure to see the type/nature of NormalSigMask and whether its state could affect the loop clauses.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask\n  - The actual object being modified inside the loop. You must confirm that NormalSigMask is not referenced in the for-loop clauses (first/second/third) and that modifications to it cannot indirectly affect the evaluation of SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX or the loop counter (for example via aliasing or dynamic queries used in those macros/functions).\n\nSummary: these symbols identify whether the for-loop clauses are using only the loop counter and pure constants (no side effects), whether the body (sigaddset) modifies the loop counter or objects used in the clauses, and whether SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX are pure constants or function-like macros with potential side effects. With these definitions the next analyst can determine compliance with the MISRA \"well-formed for\" requirements."
