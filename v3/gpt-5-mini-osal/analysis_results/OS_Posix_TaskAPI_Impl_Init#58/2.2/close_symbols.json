  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide whether any operation in OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init is dead code:\n\n- OS_impl_task_table\n  Necessary to determine whether the initial memset() actually affects program state (type, size, and whether it is later re-initialized). If the zeroing has no observable effect, it could be dead.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  The global structure mutated/read throughout the function; needed to know what state changes are observable (side effects) vs. redundant.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey\n  Written by pthread_key_create; required to know whether creating the key has observable effect elsewhere (i.e. non-dead side-effect).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.MaximumSigMask\n  Modified by sigfillset/sigdelset; needed to determine whether modifying it is meaningful for program behavior.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask\n  Obtained from sigprocmask and then modified; required to decide whether those mask manipulations are observable.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.SelectedRtScheduler\n  Read and written as a fallback/default and later set on success; needed to assess whether assignments are necessary or redundant.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits\n  Updated with chosen scheduler limits; its values influence later behavior (priority mapping) so required to determine liveness of that code.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities\n  Set on successful setschedparam and later tested (conditional early return under strict mode). Required to decide whether scheduler-related code is meaningful.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PageSize\n  Assigned from sysconf; needed to know if storing the page size is an observable effect.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t\n  The type of scheduler limits; needed to understand PriorityMin/PriorityMax semantics and whether arithmetic on them matters.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t.PriorityMax and PriorityMin\n  Fields used in comparisons and arithmetic that drive control flow; required to determine if scheduler selection/truncation code is effective.\n\n- OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams\n  Called to populate scheduler limits; its return behaviour directly influences the whole scheduler-selection block and thus whether that block executes or is effectively dead.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY\n  Constant used to truncate priority ranges; needed to check if the truncation code can change state (i.e. whether condition ever true).\n\n- pthread_key_create\n  System call whose success/failure determines early return; required to know if the call is necessary and has side-effects.\n\n- pthread_getschedparam\n  Used to decide whether to attempt RT scheduler promotion; required to know if the whole scheduling block can execute.\n\n- pthread_setschedparam\n  Called to set main thread priority; success/failure determines later flags and side-effects\u2014needed for liveness analysis.\n\n- pthread_self\n  Used as argument to getschedparam/setschedparam; included because identity of thread influences effect (main thread semantics).\n\n- sigfillset, sigdelset, sigaddset, sigprocmask\n  These POSIX functions modify signal masks; required to assess whether the signal-mask manipulations produce observable effects (not dead).\n\n- signal and OS_NoopSigHandler\n  signal(SIGHUP, OS_NoopSigHandler) registers a handler; whether this is a no-op or meaningful determines if the call is dead. The handler implementation (OS_NoopSigHandler) must be known.\n\n- SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGRTMIN, SIGRTMAX\n  Signal constants control which signals are added/removed. Knowledge of which signals are relevant is required to determine practical effect of mask modifications.\n\n- SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR\n  Scheduler policy constants used to choose policies; necessary to determine whether branches selecting these policies can ever be effective.\n\n- sysconf and _SC_PAGESIZE\n  sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) result is stored in PageSize; needed to assess whether that store is meaningful.\n\n- errno and strerror\n  Used only in debug messages but indicate error causes; whether the debug prints are side-effects depends on OS_DEBUG implementation.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  Logging macro/function: if it is a no-op in the build, the calls could be dead; if it outputs, they are observable. Must know its definition.\n\n- memset\n  Used for zeroing task table and local limit structs; needed to check if the zeroing operations have observable effects.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR\n  Return codes used by the function; required to reason about control-flow and whether early returns are meaningful.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE\n  The compile-time macro controls whether the EnableTaskPriorities check causes an error return. Presence/absence changes whether the code path is live or effectively dead.\n\nOverall rationale: to decide if any operation inside OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init is dead code we must know (a) what global or external state each operation mutates, (b) whether those mutations are ever observed elsewhere, and (c) whether calls (OS_DEBUG, signal registration, pthread/sysconf calls) have side effects in the given build/config. The symbols above cover the global variables, types, constants, system/library calls, macros and configuration switches that determine whether each statement is observable (and therefore non-dead) or removable without changing program behaviour."
