  "explanation": "Only list symbols that affect whether any controlling expression in OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init is an invariant (always true/false) or legitimately constant under the MISRA exception rules.\n\n- SIGRTMIN / SIGRTMAX: used in the for-loop controlling expression (for (sig = SIGRTMIN; sig <= SIGRTMAX; ++sig)). Whether that loop is executed or is an empty / invariant-range loop depends on the actual values or the fact that these macros may expand to non-constant calls on some platforms. The analyzer must know how these are defined on the target platform to decide if the loop bound expression is invariant.\n\n- OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams: this function is called inside the do-while and sets sched_fifo_valid, sched_rr_valid, and fills the PriorityLimits structures. The truth-values returned by this function determine the behavior of multiple if/else conditions; without knowing it is non-constant, the expressions depending on its outputs might be (incorrectly) treated as invariant.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t::PriorityMax and POSIX_PriorityLimits_t::PriorityMin: these fields (from the structures filled by OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams and stored into POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits) are used in several controlling expressions, e.g. comparisons against OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY and arithmetic like (PriorityMax - PriorityMin). The analyzer needs their semantics/possible ranges to judge whether those comparisons are invariant.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: used as the RHS in comparisons against the priority spread. Whether the comparison is invariant depends on this constant relative to the PriorityMax/Min values; include it so the analyzer can evaluate the inequality expressions.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars::PriLimits and POSIX_GlobalVars::SelectedRtScheduler: the code updates and then tests/uses these globals (SelectedRtScheduler gets assigned and PriLimits is modified). Knowing these globals' roles and initial/possible values is necessary to determine whether later controlling expressions (and the intent of the do-while block) are invariant.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars::EnableTaskPriorities: examined after the #if block (and set inside the do-while when setschedparam succeeds). The final check (inside the non-permissive build) if (!POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities) return OS_ERROR; \u2014 to decide if this conditional could be an invariant failure you must know where and how EnableTaskPriorities can change.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: a preprocessor symbol that controls whether the final runtime check on EnableTaskPriorities is compiled in. This is a compile-time controlling expression; the analyzer must know whether that macro is defined to know if the potentially invariant runtime check exists in the compiled code.\n\n- do-while controlling expression: literal 0: the function contains a do { ... } while (0) construct. MISRA explicitly permits a do-while whose controlling expression is an integer constant expression that evaluates to false. The analyzer must recognize this exact construct (while (0)) and treat it as the permitted exception.\n\nSymbols omitted (e.g., pthread_getschedparam, pthread_setschedparam, pthread_key_create, errno, individual SIG* constants like SIGINT) are not required to decide whether any controlling expression in this function is an invariant: they affect runtime success/failure but do not change whether a given controlling expression is a compile-time constant or falls under the MISRA exceptions above. If deeper semantic analysis of possible runtime invariance due to platform behavior is desired, the listed symbols are the minimum needed to make that determination."
