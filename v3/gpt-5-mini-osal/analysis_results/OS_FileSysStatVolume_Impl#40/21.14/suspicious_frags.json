  "explanation": "I examined the provided target function and all related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp in OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl or in the supplied additional code, nor are there any other string comparison operations that use memcmp (or macros that expand to memcmp). The code only reads fields (e.g., system_mountpt passed to statvfs) and performs numeric casts/assignments; no null-terminated strings are compared using memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
