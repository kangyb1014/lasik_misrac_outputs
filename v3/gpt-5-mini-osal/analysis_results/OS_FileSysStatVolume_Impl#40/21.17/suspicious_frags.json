  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code fragments. The function OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl only calls statvfs and performs casts/assignments; the macros and structure accesses shown do not invoke any string.h routines. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which applies specifically to the string.h functions) has no direct call sites to inspect in this snippet.\n\nNote: although not covered by Rule 21.17, callers should ensure that local->system_mountpt is a properly null-terminated C string and that its storage is not overrun elsewhere, since statvfs reads a pathname string. That potential issue is outside the scope of the string.h functions referenced by Rule 21.17 and so is not flagged here."
