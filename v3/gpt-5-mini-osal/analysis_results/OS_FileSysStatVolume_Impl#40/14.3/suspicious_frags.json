  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are syntactically invariant. The only conditional is\nif (statvfs(local->system_mountpt, &stat_buf) != 0)\nwhich depends on the runtime return value of statvfs and on local->system_mountpt (derived from the token) \u2014 it is not a compile-time constant or otherwise invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements in OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl, so Rule 14.3 (invariant controlling expressions) does not apply here. The assignment using the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is not a controlling expression in this fragment; its expansion is not provided, but as written it is a plain expression used to obtain a value. The provided inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken merely returns token->obj_idx and contains no control statement. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
