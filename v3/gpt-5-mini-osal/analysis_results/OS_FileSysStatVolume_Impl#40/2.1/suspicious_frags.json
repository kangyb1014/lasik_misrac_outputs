  "explanation": "The fragments selected cover all locations where control-flow or object access could render parts of the function unreachable or introduce UB that effectively prevents later code from being executed: the macro definition and its use (address-of tok, dereference of the token via *token), the inline index accessor (token->obj_idx), and the filesys table declaration (indexing bounds). The statvfs call and associated early return are included because an always-true/always-false condition, or UB prior to it, would affect reachability of the remainder of the function. The result field assignments and final return are included because they are the code that could become unreachable due to earlier failures or invalid inputs (NULL token, out-of-range index, NULL result pointer, or statvfs behavior). Other fragments in the provided code (local variable declarations, the local struct statvfs declaration, simple typedefs and the small casting macros OSAL_SIZE_C/OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C, and the OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS constant definitions) are straightforward declarations or compile-time casts that do not by themselves create unreachable code and therefore do not need separate investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1."
