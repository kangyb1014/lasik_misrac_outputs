This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (type definition): The code calls memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)) and later accesses different union/struct members (arg.id and arg.opaque_arg). To determine whether memset\u2019s size argument exactly matches the object size and whether the subsequent member accesses are valid (no flexible-array or incomplete type, union layout, padding, alignment), the full type definition is required.\n\n- osal_id_t (type definition): arg.id is assigned global_task_id. Knowing the size and representation of osal_id_t is necessary to reason about the effects of writing that member and then reading arg.opaque_arg (i.e., to ensure the combined use does not cause out-of-bounds or aliasing issues that could make the memset usage unsafe).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey (definition/type): pthread_setspecific is called with POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey and arg.opaque_arg. The key\u2019s type determines the expected pthread_setspecific semantics (pthread_key_t) and helps ensure the pointer passed is appropriate; while not directly a string.h issue, it is needed to reason about whether the value passed could cause later string operations to access out-of-bounds storage.\n\n- memset (declaration/definition): The MISRA rule targets functions from <string.h>. To verify correct usage you need the standard declaration/semantics of memset (parameter types, behavior) and to confirm there is no local macro or wrapper that changes semantics (e.g., a custom memset macro that might take different sizes or behave differently).\n\n- pthread_setspecific (declaration/prototype): Needed to know the expected type of the second parameter and the return-value conventions (so you can trace whether errno or error codes are used with strerror). This helps confirm that the value passed in (arg.opaque_arg) is not later used by any string functions in a way that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- strerror (declaration/prototype): Although strerror is not a copying/buffer-manipulating function like memcpy, it is a <string.h> function; include its declaration to confirm its parameter and return types and to check whether its use (strerror(return_code)) could indirectly lead to any string handling that violates the MISRA rule.\n\nNote: The primary direct concern for the MISRA <string.h> rule in this function is the memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)) call. The listed symbols are the minimal additional items required to verify that the memset call\u2019s size matches the actual object and that subsequent uses of arg do not lead to any out-of-bounds string operations. Additional surrounding context (e.g., any macros redefining memset/strerror) should be checked if present."
