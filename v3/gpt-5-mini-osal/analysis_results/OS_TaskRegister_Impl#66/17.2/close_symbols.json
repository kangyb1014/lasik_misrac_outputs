  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_TaskRegister_Impl violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls we must examine all possible call paths that could form a cycle reaching back to OS_TaskRegister_Impl. The listed symbols are required for that analysis for these reasons:\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare, OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread: direct callers of OS_TaskRegister_Impl (must inspect whether they, or functions they call, can lead back to OS_TaskRegister_Impl).\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint, OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry: callers of the above; needed to follow caller\u2192callee chains transitively to detect indirect recursion.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_NotifyEvent, OS_TaskDelay_Impl, OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdEqual, OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFromToken: all functions called by the callers above (present in the static call graph). Each must be inspected to see if they (directly or via other calls) call OS_TaskRegister_Impl or otherwise create a cycle.\n- pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, pthread_setspecific, strerror, memset, OS_DEBUG: functions invoked by OS_TaskRegister_Impl itself. While these are typically library calls and unlikely to call back into application code, they must be checked (or at least argued about) because callbacks or global state interactions (e.g., error-reporting hooks, logging, or thread-specific key destructors) could introduce an indirect path back to OS_TaskRegister_Impl.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey: the thread-specific key used by pthread_setspecific; the destructor function associated with this key (if any) could be invoked by the threading subsystem and might call into OS code. You must locate the pthread_key_create site and the associated destructor function (listed here as \"pthread key destructor (function registered for ThreadKey)\") and include that function in the analysis to ensure it does not call OS_TaskRegister_Impl (which would create an indirect recursion).\n\nInspecting the above symbols (and any further functions they call) allows building the full call graph reachable from and to OS_TaskRegister_Impl to prove whether any path from OS_TaskRegister_Impl leads back to it, thereby violating the MISRA recursion rule."
