  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function calls pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type) but the stored previous cancel type (written into old_type) is never read or used later. The write into that local variable is therefore an executed operation whose removal (e.g. passing NULL instead of &old_type, or omitting the storage) would not affect observable program behaviour in the sense intended by Rule 2.2. In short, the out-parameter storage is a dead store and thus constitutes dead code. \n\n(If the intent was to preserve the previous value for restoration later, that restoration does not occur here; otherwise the correct fix is to remove the unused variable and pass NULL, or document the reason and suppress the issue appropriately.)"
