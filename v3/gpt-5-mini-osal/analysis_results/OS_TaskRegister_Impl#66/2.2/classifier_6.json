  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskRegister_Impl(osal_id_t global_task_id)\n{\n    int32                    return_code;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t arg;\n    int                      old_state;\n    int                      old_type;\n\n    /*\n     * Set cancel state=ENABLED, type=DEFERRED\n     * This should be the default for new threads, but\n     * setting explicitly to be sure that a pthread_join()\n     * will work as expected in case this thread is deleted.\n     */\n    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, &old_state);\n    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type);\n\n    memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg));\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    arg.id = global_task_id;\n\n    return_code = pthread_setspecific(POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey, arg.opaque_arg);\n    if (return_code == 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl failed during pthread_setspecific() error=%s\\n\", strerror(return_code));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\ntypedef union\n{\n    void *           opaque_arg;\n    OS_ArgCallback_t arg_callback_func;\n    osal_id_t        id;\n    osal_index_t     idx;\n} OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_id_t\n...\nextern POSIX_GlobalVars_t POSIX_GlobalVars\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint                      old_type;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The local variable 'old_type' is declared and its address is passed to pthread_setcanceltype(&old_type). The function writes the previous cancel type into old_type, but that value is never subsequently read or used. Therefore the write into old_type (and the storage itself) has no effect on program behaviour and could be removed (e.g. by passing NULL), which meets the definition of dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
