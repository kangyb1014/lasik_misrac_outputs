  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. The only control statement is:\n- if (return_code == 0) { ... } else { ... }\nwhich is not invariant because return_code is assigned from pthread_setspecific(...) immediately beforehand, so the controlling expression depends on a runtime return value. There are no while, for, or do-while loops (no constant true/false loop expressions), and no other conditional expressions that use compile-time constants. The other statements (pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, memset, union assignment, and pthread_setspecific call) do not create invariant controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
