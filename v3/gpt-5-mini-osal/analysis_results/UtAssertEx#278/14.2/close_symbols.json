Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To decide whether UtAssertEx violates the MISRA rule on well-formed for loops we must inspect any code that could introduce or affect for-loop structure or loop counters either directly in this function (including macro expansions) or indirectly via calls that are part of this function's behaviour. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock\n  - Called at the start of UtAssertEx. Its implementation (or macro expansion) could contain for loops or modify global objects that are used as loop counters; any for loops inside this call are part of the behaviour of UtAssertEx and must be checked.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl\n  - Callee of UT_BSP_Lock. The transitive implementation must be inspected for for-loops or side effects on globals that might interact with loop counters.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - Called after updates and before reporting; like UT_BSP_Lock, its body or macro expansion might contain for-loops or modify objects that could be loop counters.\n\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl\n  - Callee of UT_BSP_Unlock; must be inspected transitively for loops or side effects.\n\n- UtAssert_DoReport\n  - Called by UtAssertEx and forms part of its observable behaviour. Its implementation may contain for-loops; any such for-loops must be checked for the three clauses and for modification of loop counters (including via functions it calls).\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - Called (directly or transitively) by UtAssert_DoReport per the call graph. Its implementation might contain for-loops or modify globals used as loop counters; it must be examined transitively.\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters\n  - Global/extern structure whose members (TotalTestCases and CaseCount[]) are incremented in UtAssertEx. To determine compliance we must see the definition/type (to know member names/types) and search for other code (especially in called functions) that might use these members as for-loop counters \u2014 the rule forbids modifying a loop counter in the loop body.\n\n- UT_TotalCounters\n  - Global/extern structure providing TestSegmentCount (read here). Its definition and any uses elsewhere (or in called functions) must be checked to ensure it is not used as a loop counter that would be illegally modified in a loop body.\n\n- CurrentSegment\n  - Global/extern object passed to UtAssert_DoReport. Its type and uses must be known to ensure it is not (or does not become) a loop counter modified illegally inside any called function.\n\n- UtAssert_CaseType_t\n  - The enum/type of CaseType. Knowing its underlying type and definition is necessary to confirm indexing into CaseCount[] and casting semantics (e.g., whether comparisons/casts could hide side effects or invalid loop-counter usage).\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_PASS\n  - Constant/enum value assigned when Expression is true. Knowing its definition ensures the value used for indexing CaseCount[] is valid and does not cause undefined behaviour that could affect loop analysis.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX\n  - Constant/enum value used as an upper bound in the comparison before indexing CaseCount[]; required to ensure indexing is safe and that no hidden control-flow (macros) introduces loops.\n\nNote: vsnprintf / stdarg usage (va_list/va_start/va_end) are standard library constructs that do not affect for-loop formation in this function, so they are not required to assess MISRA rule compliance for for-loops here. The priority is to inspect any functions called (and their transitive callees) and the globals/types that are read or modified by UtAssertEx because the MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body and forbids modifying loop counters in the loop body."
