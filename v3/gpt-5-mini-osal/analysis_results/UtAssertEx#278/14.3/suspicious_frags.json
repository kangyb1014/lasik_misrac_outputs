  "explanation": "Only two controlling expressions appear in the provided function: the two if statements above. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or other conditional constructs in this snippet that could violate Rule 14.3. Other lines are assignments, increments, function calls (UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, va_start/vsnprintf/va_end, UtAssert_DoReport) or a return statement and do not contain controlling expressions; therefore they do not fall under Rule 14.3 and need not be investigated for invariant controlling expressions. The provided exceptions (infinite loops or a specific do-while constant-false case) are not applicable to any other code in this function."
