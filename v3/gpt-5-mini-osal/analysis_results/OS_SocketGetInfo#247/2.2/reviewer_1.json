It is called from OS_SocketGetInfo(), but since the function does not modify sock_prop, the token, or any global state, removing the call and the function would not change the program's behaviour. Therefore the executed operation (the call/return) constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SocketGetInfo:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t id, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(lock_mode, idtype, token);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return return_code;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(idtype, id, &token->obj_idx);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_id = id;\n\n        /*\n         * The \"ConvertToken\" routine will return with the global lock\n         * in a state appropriate for returning to the caller, as indicated\n         * by the \"check_mode\" parameter.\n         *\n         * Note If this operation fails, then it always unlocks the global for\n         * all check_mode's other than NONE.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdRelease(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, NULL);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_socket_prop_t *sock_prop)\n{\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_common_record_t *const OS_global_stream_table\n...\ntypedef struct OS_common_record OS_common_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char      name[OS_MAX_API_NAME]; /**< @brief Name of the socket */\n    osal_id_t creator;               /**< @brief OSAL TaskID which opened the socket */\n} OS_socket_prop_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the call to OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl is dead code requires a project\u2011wide/behavioural analysis, not just the fact that the current implementation returns OS_SUCCESS. In particular:\n\n- The MISRA rule explicitly notes that timing can be part of an embedded system's behaviour. Even a no\u2011op call consumes time and can affect scheduling/timing, so removing it could change behaviour.\n- The call is part of an abstraction point/porting hook. Even if the present implementation is a stub that immediately returns, other build configurations or platform\u2011specific implementations may provide side effects; you must consider all translation units/configurations used in the project.\n- The mere presence of an implementation that currently does nothing does not automatically prove the call has no observable effect across the project. A project\u2011level review is needed to show that removing the call does not change behaviour in any configuration.\n\nIf you can prove for the whole project (all builds/configurations, all timing/real\u2011time considerations) that OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl is always a pure no\u2011op with no observable timing/ordering impact, then the call would be dead and would violate Rule 2.2. Given the supplied information, however, that proof is not present, so the agent A report is not correct as a definitive MISRA 2.2 violation."
