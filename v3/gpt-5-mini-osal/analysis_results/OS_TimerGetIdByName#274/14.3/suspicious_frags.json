  "explanation": "I inspected the function and related definitions for controlling expressions. The three locations above are the only places in the provided code where control flow depends on expressions that could be invariant: the two pointer-check macro invocations, the computation of objtype from the current task id, and the subsequent if comparing objtype to a compile-time constant. Other fragments need not be investigated: the return and assignment statements are not controlling expressions; the call to OS_ObjectIdFindByName is a normal function call (not a control expression); the inline helper OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl merely performs a bit-shift (a runtime computation) and does not itself introduce a controlling expression; the typedefs and constant macro definitions are not control-flow expressions. Also, common macro idioms that expand to do { ... } while (0) (if present) are an allowed exception per the MISRA rule, so they do not require further investigation here."
