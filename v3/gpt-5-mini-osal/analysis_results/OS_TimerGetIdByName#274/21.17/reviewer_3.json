True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf LENGTHCHECK is implemented using an unbounded <string.h> function such as strlen(name), then a non-terminated or overly long name buffer can cause reads past the object bounds. For example, a caller passes a char name[OS_MAX_API_NAME] filled with non-zero bytes with no terminating '\\0' (or passes a pointer to a buffer whose terminator lies beyond OS_MAX_API_NAME). strlen(name) would scan past the buffer boundary and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If LENGTHCHECK instead uses a bounded operation such as strnlen(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME) or otherwise guarantees no read past the limit, then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TimerGetIdByName:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE - 1;\n        }\n\n        msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0;\n\n        OS_ConsoleWrite(OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfConsoleId, msg_buffer);\n    }\n}\n...\nstatic inline osal_objtype_t OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(osal_id_t id)\n{\n    return (OS_ObjectIdToInteger(id) >> OS_OBJECT_TYPE_SHIFT);\n}\n...\nosal_id_t OS_TaskGetId_Impl(void)\n{\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t self_record;\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    self_record.opaque_arg = pthread_getspecific(POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey);\n\n    return self_record.id;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindByName(osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, osal_id_t *object_id)\n{\n    int32             return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n\n    /*\n     * As this is an internal-only function, calling it with NULL is allowed.\n     * This is required by the file/dir/socket API since these DO allow multiple\n     * instances of the same name.\n     */\n    ARGCHECK(name, OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND);\n    LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, OS_ERR_NAME_TOO_LONG);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, idtype, name, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        *object_id = token.obj_id;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(lock_mode, idtype, OS_ObjectNameMatch, (void *)name, token);\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdRelease(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, NULL);\n}\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE 0x08\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB 0x09\n...\n#define OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE (-35)\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_id_t\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_objtype_t\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not demonstrably present in the code shown. OS_TimerGetIdByName itself does not call any <string.h> functions; it forwards the name to OS_ObjectIdFindByName which performs ARGCHECK and LENGTHCHECK. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 would be violated if one of those checks (or some other routine called subsequently) used an unbounded string function (e.g. strlen) on a caller-supplied buffer that might lack a terminating '\\0'. The provided code does not include the implementation of LENGTHCHECK (or any other string helper), so there is no evidence in the snippet that an unbounded <string.h> function is actually used. Therefore the agent A\u2019s claim cannot be shown to be correct based on the code given. To be safe, the LENGTHCHECK implementation should be inspected and, if it currently uses strlen or similar unbounded functions, it should be changed to a bounded alternative (e.g. strnlen or an explicit length parameter) to ensure compliance with Rule 21.17."
