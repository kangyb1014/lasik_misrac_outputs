  "scenario": "Both parameters are used to modify the objects: *token_to is assigned from *token_from (writes token_to) and token_from->lock_mode is set to OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE (writes token_from). Because both pointees are intentionally modified, they cannot be const-qualified and MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not violated. (If token_from were only read, it should be declared const OS_object_token_t * to comply with Rule 8.13.)"
