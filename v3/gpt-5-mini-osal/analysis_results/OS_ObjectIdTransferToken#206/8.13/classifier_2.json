  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment reads from token_from and writes to token_to, but token_from is subsequently modified (token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE), so token_from cannot be declared as pointer-to-const. token_to is a destination and likewise must be writable. Therefore using non-const pointers here is appropriate. (If the function only read token_from and did not modify it, failing to declare it as const would be a violation.)"
