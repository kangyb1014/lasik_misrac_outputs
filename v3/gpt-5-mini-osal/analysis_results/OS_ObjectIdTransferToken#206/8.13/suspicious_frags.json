  "explanation": "The rule concerns pointers that could/should be const-qualified. In the provided code the only pointer objects are the two function parameters and their uses inside the function; there are no other pointer variables or pointer-type struct members shown that would need inspection. The struct member referenced (lock_mode) is an integral-like member (OS_lock_mode_t) not a pointer. Therefore the function declaration and the two pointer operations above are the only fragments that need investigation for possible use of const; no other fragments in the snippet are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
