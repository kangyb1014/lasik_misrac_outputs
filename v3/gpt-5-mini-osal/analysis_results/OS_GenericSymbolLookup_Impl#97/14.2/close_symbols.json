The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "dlerror \u2014 called by OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl; may have side effects (global error state) that contribute to the behaviour of a for-loop body and must be inspected for modifications of objects used as loop counters.\n\ndlsym \u2014 called by OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl; may have implementation-specific side effects (e.g., modify global state) and its behaviour is part of any for-loop body that calls this function.\n\nOS_DEBUG \u2014 used for diagnostic printing in error paths; its implementation may modify globals or I/O state that could be relevant to determining persistent side effects inside a for-loop body.\n\nOS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR \u2014 status macros/values written/read by the function; needed to understand whether any status objects modified here are used as loop counters or loop-control flags in callers.\n\ncpuaddr (typedef) \u2014 the function writes *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function; the type/representation of cpuaddr and the provenance of the SymbolAddress pointer are needed to determine whether this write could modify an object used as a loop counter in a caller's for loop.\n\nOS_SymbolLookup_Impl \u2014 direct caller of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl; must be inspected to see if it calls the target from inside a for loop and whether any loop counter or control object could be modified by the target.\n\nOS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl \u2014 direct caller of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl; must be inspected for for-loops that include calls to the target and to see which loop variables/objects are in scope.\n\nOS_SymbolLookup \u2014 caller of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl; include to follow the call chain upward to any for-loops that might include the target in their body.\n\nOS_ModuleSymbolLookup \u2014 caller of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; include to follow the call chain upward for the same reason.\n\nOS_ObjectIdIterateActive, OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken \u2014 functions called by the callers (per the static call graph). They may be involved in iterator/loop implementations (loop counters, iterator state) or modify objects used as loop counters; their implementations must be checked to determine whether the behaviour of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (and functions it calls) could violate the MISRA for-loop clauses when invoked from those loops.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule applies to the behaviour of a for-loop body including called functions. To decide compliance you must therefore inspect (a) this function and the functions it calls (dlerror, dlsym, OS_DEBUG) for side effects, and (b) any callers up the chain that might call this function inside a for-loop (the listed callers and their iterator helper functions)."
