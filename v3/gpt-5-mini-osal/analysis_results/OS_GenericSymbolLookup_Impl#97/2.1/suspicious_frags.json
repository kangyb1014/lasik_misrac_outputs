  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are provably unreachable in the supplied code. Reasons: \n\n- There are no constant conditional constructs (e.g. if (0), if (1), switch with impossible cases) or unconditional returns/gotos preceding other statements that would make following code unreachable. Every if/else branch in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl can be taken depending on runtime results of dlsym()/dlerror(), so none of those branches is statically unreachable.\n\n- Loop code (the while loop in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl) is conditional on the iterator and may be executed depending on the runtime state; it is not statically unreachable.\n\n- Macros such as OS_DEBUG expanding to nothing do not create unreachable code \u2014 they merely remove side effects at preprocessing time; the source statements remain syntactically reachable (their effect is just empty after macro expansion).\n\n- All return points are at function ends or clearly intended points; there are no statements following an unconditional return inside the same function body that would be unreachable.\n\n- Caller-side pointer checks are present in the public APIs (OS_SymbolLookup, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup) so the dereference in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl is expected to be safe in normal API usage; even if callers omitted checks, that would be a potential runtime error but not statically unreachable code.\n\nGiven the code provided, there are no fragments that meet the definition of unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1. If you want, I can re-evaluate if additional project-wide macros or build-time configurations (not provided here) could introduce constant conditions or dead code (for example, if OS_ObjectIdIterateActive/OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext are defined as no-ops or as macros that expand to constant false)."
