  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required to decide if any operations in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl are dead code:\n\n- dlerror\n  - Reason: The function is called twice (once to clear any prior error and once to inspect the error). To determine whether those calls (and the branch testing dlError != NULL) have any observable effect you must know dlerror's semantics and side effects (e.g. whether calling it changes library state or can ever return non-NULL). If dlerror is a no-op on the target platform then the dlerror-related branch and/or the initial dlerror() call could be dead.\n\n- dlsym\n  - Reason: The returned Function value drives the later branches (Function == NULL) and the final assignment to *SymbolAddress. Understanding whether dlsym can return NULL, under what conditions, and whether it has side effects is necessary to judge whether the Function==NULL branch and the assignment are meaningful or removable.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Reason: The error branches only call OS_DEBUG. To determine if those branches are dead you must know whether OS_DEBUG has observable side effects (e.g. logging I/O, mutexes, state changes) or is compiled out as a no-op. If it is a no-op then the entire branch body may be dead; if it logs/affects state then it is not dead.\n\n- OS_ERROR\n  - Reason: Initial status is set to OS_ERROR and returned in error cases. To decide if setting status to OS_ERROR (and not changing it in the error branches) has an observable effect you must know the exact value/semantics of OS_ERROR and how callers interpret it.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - Reason: status is set to OS_SUCCESS only in the success branch. Whether that assignment is meaningful depends on how callers use the returned status (so the meaning of OS_SUCCESS must be known).\n\n- cpuaddr\n  - Reason: The function writes *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function unconditionally. The type/width/representation of cpuaddr and whether the pointer-to-integer cast can have side effects or cause truncation matters to determine if that write is required behavior or could be removed.\n\n- int32\n  - Reason: The status variable type; knowing its typedef/representation is needed if return-value semantics (e.g. specific integral values or ranges) affect caller behavior or if conversions matter for side-effects.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl\n  - Reason: Immediate caller of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. To determine if parts of the target function are dead you must inspect how this caller uses the return status and SymbolAddress (e.g. does it only care about SymbolAddress, only about status, or use OS_DEBUG output). If the caller ignores certain effects then some operations in the callee could be dead.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl\n  - Reason: Another direct caller. Same rationale as above: you must see whether this caller relies on the callee's side-effects (status, SymbolAddress, debug output) to decide removability of operations in the callee.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup\n  - Reason: Higher-level entry point that may propagate or interpret return status and symbol address. Understanding end-to-end usage (including this wrapper) is necessary to determine if removing certain operations in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl would affect observable program behavior.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup\n  - Reason: Higher-level caller of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. Its usage of the result helps determine whether callee-side operations are observable.\n\nIn summary: you need the dynamic semantics (return values and side effects) of dlerror, dlsym, and OS_DEBUG plus the definitions/meanings of OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS and cpuaddr/int32, and you must inspect the caller functions (both immediate and higher-level) to see how they rely on the callee's outputs and side effects. Only with these symbols can you determine if any executed operation in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl can be removed without changing program behaviour (i.e. is dead code)."
