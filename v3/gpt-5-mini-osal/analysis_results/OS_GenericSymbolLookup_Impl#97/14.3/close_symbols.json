  "explanation": "dlerror: The value assigned to dlError comes from dlerror(); to determine whether the controlling expression (dlError != NULL) can be invariant we must know dlerror()'s prototype and runtime semantics (it clears/returns the dynamic error string and may return NULL). dlsym: The value assigned to Function comes from dlsym(); to determine whether (Function == NULL) is invariant we must know dlsym()'s prototype and runtime semantics (returns symbol address or NULL and interacts with dlerror's error indicator). OS_DEBUG: The macro/function invoked in the error branches could have side effects; we must confirm it does not alter dlError/Function or otherwise make the controlling expressions effectively invariant. NULL: The comparisons use NULL; its definition (usually ((void*)0)) must be known to confirm the comparisons are not comparing against a compile-time constant in some unusual way. cpuaddr: The cast (cpuaddr)Function and the definition of cpuaddr (typedef/width) must be known to ensure no macro/type trickery affects the evaluation of Function in the controlling expressions. int32: The type of the return/status variable; its definition is needed to ensure no unusual macro/type behavior. OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: These constants set status but do not directly control the branches; include them to verify they are not macros that alter control-flow semantics or the values used in the function."
