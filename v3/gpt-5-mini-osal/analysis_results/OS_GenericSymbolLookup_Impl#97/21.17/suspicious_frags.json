  "explanation": "No direct calls to the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code snippets. The items not selected for investigation therefore do not themselves invoke standard string.h routines. The flagged fragments are the call sites where character pointers (SymbolName / symbol_name / record->name_entry) are passed into other functions or used in diagnostics; those call sites should be inspected because the callee implementations (not fully shown here) might internally use functions from <string.h> and could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Other lines (assignments, pointer casts, dlerror/dlsym usage, and OS_DEBUG as defined here) do not use the string.h APIs and are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Additionally, the public-facing APIs shown perform pointer checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER) before use in the higher-level calls, reducing obvious parameter misuse in the visible code; any hidden/internal implementations (e.g., OS_SymbolLookup_Static or other modules not included) would need their own review, which is why the call sites to them are included above for investigation."
