  "explanation": "The following pointer uses/decls are NOT flagged for investigation: (1) const char *dlError; is already const-qualified and thus aligned with Rule 8.13; (2) const char *SymbolName is already const-qualified; (3) cpuaddr *SymbolAddress must be non-const because the function writes to *SymbolAddress (output parameter), so making it a pointer-to-const would be incorrect; (4) the assignment dlError = dlerror(); assigns a non-const char* return to a const-qualified pointer (adding const), which is permitted and conforms to the intent of Rule 8.13; (5) the final write *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function; is an intended store through a non-const output parameter and therefore should not be const-qualified. The suspicious fragments listed should be investigated to determine whether the non-const pointer types could and should be declared with const-qualified pointee types (or whether API constraints prevent doing so)."
