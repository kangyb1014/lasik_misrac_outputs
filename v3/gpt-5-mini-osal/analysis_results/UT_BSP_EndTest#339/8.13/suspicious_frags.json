  "explanation": "The function parameter TestCounters is already declared as a pointer to const (const UtAssert_TestCounter_t *), so usages that only read from it (e.g. TestCounters->TestSegmentCount and indexing CaseCount[]) do not need further investigation. The local array Message is used as an output buffer (written by snprintf), so it must be a non-const char[] and that use is appropriate. Calls to snprintf and strlen use standard library prototypes that already take const where appropriate (snprintf writes to Message, so its destination cannot be const; the format argument is const). UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock and OS_BSP_SetExitCode do not involve pointer parameters and thus are not relevant to Rule 8.13. The two listed calls are flagged because they pass pointer arguments (a string literal and the Message buffer / TestCounters pointer) to external functions whose parameter declarations are not shown here; those callee parameter types should be checked to ensure they accept const-qualified pointers where possible (e.g. const char * or const UtAssert_TestCounter_t *)."
