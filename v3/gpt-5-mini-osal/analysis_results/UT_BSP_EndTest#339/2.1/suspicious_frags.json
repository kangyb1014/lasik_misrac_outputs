  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to be statically unreachable. The conditionals (TestSegmentCount > 1 and the OR of CaseCount checks) are evaluated from runtime data, not compile-time constants, so both the summary-call branch and either exit-code branch are potentially reachable. There are no return statements, infinite loops, goto/labels, or other constructs that would render subsequent statements unreachable. Dereferencing TestCounters is a potential runtime safety/NULL-check issue but is not an instance of unreachable code. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
