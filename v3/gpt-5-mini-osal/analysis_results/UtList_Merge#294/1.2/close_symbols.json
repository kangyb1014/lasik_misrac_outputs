  "explanation": "To determine if UtList_Merge uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the types and any macros/attributes used by the code. Specifically:\n- UtListNode_t (typedef/struct definition): The struct/typedef may use non\u2011standard constructs (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, compiler attributes, bit\u2011fields in unusual contexts, typeof, nonstandard storage-class specifiers) that would be language extensions. The full definition is required.\n- UtListNode_t::Prev (member declaration): The exact declaration/type of Prev may use an extension (e.g., an attribute on the member, nonstandard pointer qualifiers, or a macro alias). Verify it is a standard pointer/member.\n- UtListNode_t::Next (member declaration): Same rationale as Prev \u2014 need the concrete member declaration to detect extensions.\n- Header(s) that declare/define UtListNode_t and any related macros: Extensions are often introduced via header macros or pragmas. The header will show any macros, typedefs, or pragmas that affect the struct or members.\n- Function declaration/prototype of UtList_Merge: The external prototype (in headers) may include compiler-specific qualifiers/attributes (e.g., __attribute__, __declspec, inline/always_inline macros) that are language extensions.\n- Any compiler/portability headers or macros pulled in by those headers: Many projects wrap compiler extensions in macros (mapping to __attribute__ etc.). To judge MISRA compliance you must inspect those macros/headers to see if the code relies on compiler-specific extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the struct and its members, the headers and any related macro/attribute definitions, and the function prototype) is sufficient to determine whether the implementation uses language extensions as defined in compiler documentation."
