  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: a void function, pointer parameters, pointer dereference and struct/union member access (->), and simple assignments. There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, labels-as-values, anonymous or unnamed compiler-specific constructs, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore no fragments need to be flagged for Rule 1.2 investigation."
