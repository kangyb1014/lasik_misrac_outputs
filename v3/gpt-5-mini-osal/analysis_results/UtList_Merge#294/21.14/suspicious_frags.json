  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any string-comparison function) appear in the provided code. The function only declares and manipulates UtListNode_t pointers and performs pointer assignments to link list nodes; there are no char* or string operations, no calls to library functions, and no use of memcmp via macros or wrappers in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
