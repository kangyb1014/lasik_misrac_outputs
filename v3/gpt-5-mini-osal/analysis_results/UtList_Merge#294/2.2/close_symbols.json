  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required to determine if UtList_Merge contains dead code:\n\n- UtListNode_t (struct definition showing Next and Prev members): The function performs four pointer assignments to the Next and Prev fields. You must confirm the exact field names, types and layout to ensure these assignments actually modify observable program state (and are not e.g. aliases, unused padding, or conditional macros). The struct definition also reveals whether Next/Prev are used elsewhere and whether writing them has semantic effect.\n\n- UtList_GetHead: This function likely obtains the head of a list and is a primary consumer of list state. To decide if merging two lists has observable effect, we must see how GetHead reads the list heads and their links after a merge.\n\n- UtList_GetNext: Traversal uses Next. If no consumer ever uses Next after UtList_Merge, the Next assignments could be dead. Inspecting GetNext shows whether the Next links written by Merge are subsequently read.\n\n- UtList_GetObject: Higher\u2011level readers may obtain objects from nodes; if objects are fetched based on linkage (Next/Prev), Merge may matter. GetObject helps determine whether subsequent behavior depends on the linking performed by Merge.\n\n- UtList_Destroy: Destructors/free routines may walk links (Next/Prev) or rely on link invariants. If Destroy ignores link fields or always reinitializes them, the Merge writes might be unnecessary. Inspect Destroy to see if Merge affects observable behavior.\n\n- UtTest_Run (caller of UtList_Merge): Static graph shows UtTest_Run calls UtList_Merge. To determine whether removing the Merge assignments changes program behavior, we must inspect the call site: which lists are merged, what operations follow the merge, and whether those operations rely on the modified links.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock: UtTest_Run acquires/releases locks around list operations. Concurrency or ordering semantics can make the Merge needed for synchronization (ordering or visibility). If Merge is only used to provide a synchronization point, removing it could affect timing/ordering and thus behavior. Inspecting lock usage is required to rule this in/out.\n\n- Global list head variables passed to UtList_Merge in UtTest_Run (concrete symbol names): Knowing the actual global/stack list objects merged (their identities and other accessors) is necessary to trace whether those specific lists are later used. The symbol names let you follow uses across the code base.\n\n- List implementation documentation / invariants (e.g. whether lists are circular doubly\u2011linked, empty\u2011list sentinel semantics): The Merge code assumes particular invariants (e.g., TagHead->Prev points to tail, lists are circular). If those invariants mean Merge is a no\u2011op for certain inputs (or always necessary), that determines whether the assignments are dead. Documentation or comments that define these invariants are therefore required.\n\nTogether, these symbols let the next analyst trace reads of Next/Prev after the Merge (through GetHead/GetNext/GetObject/Destroy and usage in UtTest_Run), verify struct semantics, and determine whether the four pointer assignments are observable (thus not dead) or removable without affecting program behavior."
