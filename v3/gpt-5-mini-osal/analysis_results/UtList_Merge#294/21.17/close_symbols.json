  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n1) UtListNode_t (struct definition)\n   - The merge function manipulates members of UtListNode_t (Prev and Next). To be certain no string.h function is involved indirectly (for example, if Prev/Next are not plain pointers but alias to char arrays or packed fields) you must see the full type. Also need to confirm member types are pointer types and there is no hidden array or buffer that string functions could address out-of-bounds.\n\n2) definitions of the Prev and Next fields (or any macros/inline accessors used to access them)\n   - Some projects use macros, inline functions, or unions to implement list links. If Prev/Next accessors expand to calls or to pointer casts that use string functions (or arithmetic on char pointers), that could affect a MISRA string.h rule analysis. Obtain the exact definitions to ensure the assignments are simple pointer updates.\n\n3) UtList.h (header declaring UtListNode_t and related list macros)\n   - The header typically contains the typedef, member declarations, macros, and any annotations. This single location will reveal whether Prev/Next are standard pointer fields or something else that could trigger string handling or pointer arithmetic concerns.\n\n4) UtList_GetHead\n   - UtTest_Run (the caller) obtains list heads via UtList_GetHead before calling UtList_Merge. To prove that TagHead1/TagHead2 passed into UtList_Merge are valid UtListNode_t pointers and not pointers into character buffers or into objects that could be subject to string operations, inspect how GetHead constructs/returns the head pointer.\n\n5) UtList_GetNext\n   - Related list traversal routines show how nodes are linked and what invariants (circular list, sentinel node, non-NULL pointers) exist. Those invariants are important to show the pointer assignments in UtList_Merge cannot produce out-of-bounds accesses by themselves.\n\n6) UtList_GetObject\n   - If list nodes are overlays on other objects (e.g., node is embedded inside a larger object), GetObject reveals the embedding and whether Prev/Next might alias parts of a larger buffer (which could be used with string functions elsewhere). Knowing that prevents false positives/negatives for the string.h rule.\n\n7) UtList_Destroy\n   - The destroy/cleanup functions show lifecycle (allocation/ownership) and whether nodes can be freed/invalidated before/after merge, which could cause later string.h usage to operate on invalid memory. Understanding lifecycle helps determine if UtList_Merge could indirectly create conditions that lead to out-of-bounds string operations.\n\n8) UtTest_Run (call site)\n   - Examine how UtTest_Run obtains and passes TagHead1 and TagHead2 to UtList_Merge (via the above list APIs). The call site will show whether the function can ever be invoked with non-list pointers (e.g., pointers derived from character buffers) or with NULL/invalid values. This is needed to conclude definitively that UtList_Merge itself does not violate the MISRA string.h rule.\n\nNote: The target function contains no direct calls to any <string.h> functions. The listed symbols are required only to confirm there are no indirect or aliasing situations (e.g., Prev/Next being char arrays or macros expanding to string operations) that could make the assignments correspond to string handling that might access out-of-bounds memory."
