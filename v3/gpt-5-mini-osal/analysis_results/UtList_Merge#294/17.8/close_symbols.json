  "explanation": "UtListNode_t (full struct/type definition): Needed to determine the types of Prev and Next and whether they are pointer members, bitfields, arrays, or something else. MISRA's allowance (you may modify the object pointed to but not the pointer parameter itself) depends on whether the assignments modify members of the pointed-to object or attempt to reassign the parameter value.\n\nDefinition of the Prev member (type or macro): If Prev is a member its type (e.g. UtListNode_t *) confirms that Tail1/Tail2 are pointers to nodes and that assigning to TagHead1->Prev modifies the pointed-to object. If Prev is actually a macro or accessor, its expansion could reassign the parameter itself \u2014 the exact definition is required.\n\nDefinition of the Next member (type or macro): Same rationale as Prev \u2014 need to know whether Next is a plain struct member (safe to modify the pointee) or a macro/inline accessor that might change the pointer parameter.\n\nUtList_Merge function prototype/declaration (header): The external declaration may add const/volatile qualifiers to the parameters (e.g. UtListNode_t * const or const UtListNode_t *), or provide different typedefs; these qualifiers affect whether modifying the pointer or the pointee is allowed under MISRA. The prototype ensures the intended parameter types/qualifiers are known."
