  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: assigning Tail1->Next = TagHead2 does not require the pointed-to type to be const because the function subsequently modifies the nodes (e.g. TagHead2->Prev = Tail1 and TagHead1->Prev = Tail2). The pointers must refer to mutable UtListNode_t objects, so qualifying the pointee as const is not appropriate here."
