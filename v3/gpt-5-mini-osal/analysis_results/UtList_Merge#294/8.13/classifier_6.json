  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: Tail2->Next and TagHead1 are pointers to mutable UtListNode_t objects and the function modifies node link fields (e.g., TagHead1->Prev = Tail2). The assignment Tail2->Next = TagHead1 stores a pointer to a node that is later modified, so qualifying the pointee as const would be inappropriate. (A violation would occur if the code treated the pointee as read-only but used a non-const pointer \u2014 e.g., a function that only inspects nodes but takes UtListNode_t * instead of const UtListNode_t *.)"
