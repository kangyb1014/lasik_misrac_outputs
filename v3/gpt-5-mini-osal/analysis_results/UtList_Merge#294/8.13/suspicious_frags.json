  "explanation": "I selected all lines that declare or manipulate pointers (function parameters, local pointer variables, and pointer-based assignments) because Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types; these are the locations that must be reviewed to determine if const qualification is possible. There are no other lines in the function that introduce pointer types or pointer targets that could be const-qualified, so no additional fragments require investigation."
