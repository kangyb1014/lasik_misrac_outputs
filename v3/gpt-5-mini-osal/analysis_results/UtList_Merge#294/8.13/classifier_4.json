  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: Tail1 is used to modify the list (e.g. Tail1->Next = TagHead2), so it must be a pointer to a non-const UtListNode_t. Declaring it const would prevent the intended assignments. If Tail1 were only read, it should be const, but in this function the node is written, so using a non-const pointer is appropriate."
