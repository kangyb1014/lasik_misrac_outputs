  "explanation": "To determine whether UtMem2BinFile violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion, we must inspect every function it calls (and the functions those call) to see whether any call path leads back to UtMem2BinFile. Each listed symbol is therefore required:\n\n- fopen: directly called to open the file. Must verify fopen (or any wrapper used here) does not call back into user code that could reach UtMem2BinFile.\n- fwrite: directly called to write memory to the file. Inspect to ensure no callbacks or user hooks lead back to UtMem2BinFile.\n- fclose: directly called to close the file. Same reason as fopen/fwrite (callbacks/user hooks could create a cycle).\n- printf: used on the error path. Need to check that printf (or any substituted implementation) does not invoke user code that can call UtMem2BinFile.\n- strerror: used to format the error message. Ensure it (or its implementation) cannot cause a callback into UtMem2BinFile.\n- errno: referenced by strerror; included because implementations or macros around errno could be indirect call sites or affect linked code paths.\n- UtAssert_True: called on the error path (in code). Must examine its implementation to see whether it (directly or via helpers) calls UtMem2BinFile.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: present in the static call graph as a callee associated with the UtAssert family; include its definition because UtAssert_True may call it, and any callers/callees of UtAssert_GetContext must be inspected for potential paths back to UtMem2BinFile.\n\nIf any of these symbols (or functions they in turn call) contain a call chain that leads back to UtMem2BinFile, that would constitute indirect recursion. Inspecting these symbols' definitions and their transitive callees is sufficient to determine whether UtMem2BinFile participates in a recursive call cycle."
