If UtAssertEx is implemented as a non\u2011returning routine (for example it calls abort/exit/longjmp or is flagged noreturn), then the subsequent statement `return false;` is unreachable and thus the project would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is plausible but not proved by the supplied code. The macro UtAssert_True expands to UtAssertEx(...), but no definition or attributes for UtAssertEx are provided. If UtAssertEx is implemented as a non\u2011returning routine (e.g. calls abort/exit/longjmp or is declared noreturn) then the subsequent return false; is indeed unreachable and would constitute a Rule 2.1 violation. However, given only the provided code and the UtAssert_GetContext helper, there is no evidence that UtAssertEx is non\u2011returning, so one cannot conclude a violation from the fragment alone. Therefore the report as stated (that the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1) is not correct unless it is established that UtAssertEx cannot return. Recommended action: inspect/declare the semantics of UtAssertEx; if it is non\u2011returning remove the trailing return (and document/annotate accordingly) or if it may return keep the return and no violation exists."
