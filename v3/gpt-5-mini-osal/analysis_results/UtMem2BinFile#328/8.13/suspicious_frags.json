  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer usages in the provided function and related definitions: \n\n- The Memory parameter is declared as const void *Memory, which satisfies Rule 8.13 (pointer to const-qualified type where appropriate). It is passed to fwrite, which accepts a const void*, so no change is possible or needed.\n- The Filename parameter is declared as const char *Filename, which is correct for a string input and matches fopen\u2019s prototype (const char *). No investigation needed.\n- The local variable FILE *fp cannot reasonably be changed to point to a const-qualified FILE (i.e., const FILE *) because the standard I/O functions (fopen, fwrite, fclose) take and operate on FILE *; making the pointee const would be incompatible with those APIs.\n- The use of strerror(errno) yields a char * from the C library; this is a library-provided pointer and cannot be changed here to a pointer-to-const without conflicting with the library\u2019s API. It is used only for read-only reporting (printf), so no further action for Rule 8.13.\n- No other pointer declarations or uses appear in the supplied code or related snippets (UtAssert_True, UtAssert_GetContext, typedef for uint32), so there are no additional candidates.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
