  "explanation": "No code fragment in UtMem2BinFile modifies any of the function parameters. Reasons:\n- Memory is declared as const void * and is only passed to fwrite (read-only use); the function does not assign to Memory or attempt to modify the object via that pointer.\n- Filename is declared as const char * and is only passed to fopen and printf; there is no assignment to Filename or any operation that changes the pointer itself.\n- Length is an integer parameter (uint32) and is only used as an argument to fwrite; it is not assigned to or modified.\n- All local variables (fp) are local and do not alias the parameters.\n- Macro calls (UtAssert_True) and function calls (fopen, fwrite, printf, fclose, strerror) do not modify the parameter variables within this function.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
