  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not appear to use compiler language extensions and therefore do not need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n- Standard library functions and macros: fopen, fwrite, fclose, printf, strerror, errno, __FILE__, and __LINE__ are part of the C standard library/preprocessor, not compiler extensions.\n- Built-in/standard types: uint32_t (and a typedef to uint32) and the use of bool/true/false are standard C (from C99 onward) and are not compiler extensions by themselves.\n- Common language constructs: the assignment inside the if condition, return statements, and function parameter/argument usage are standard C and not extensions.\n- The use of UtAssert_True at call sites (aside from the specific macro form reported) is ordinary macro invocation behavior; nothing else in the function body uses known compiler-specific language extensions.\n\nOnly the listed fragments should be investigated further for potential use of a nonstandard/implementation-specific macro parameter style."
