  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2BinFile:\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFile(const void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\")))\n    {\n        fwrite(Memory, Length, 1, fp);\n        fclose(fp);\n        return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File\");\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtMem2BinFile:\n#define UtAssert_True(Expression, __VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(Expression,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The 'return false;' is executed when fopen() fails and UtAssert_True(...) returns, so removing it would change program behaviour. In configurations where UtAssert_True is non\u2011returning (always aborts), the return becomes unreachable\u2014but per Rule 2.2 note 2 unreachable code is not considered dead code. Therefore there is no Rule 2.2 violation."
