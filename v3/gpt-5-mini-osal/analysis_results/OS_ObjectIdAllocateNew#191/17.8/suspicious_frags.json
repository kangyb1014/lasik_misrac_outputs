  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- idtype is a value parameter and is never assigned to or altered.\n- name is only compared to NULL and passed (via a cast) to another function; there is no assignment to name (no name = ... , no increment/decrement). Casting (void *)name does not modify the parameter itself \u2014 it only changes the type for the call. (Removing constness may be a concern for other MISRA rules, but it is not a modification of the parameter variable as covered by Rule 17.8.)\n- token (OS_object_token_t *token) is used and dereferenced (token->obj_id) and passed to other functions, but the pointer variable token is never reassigned or modified in this function. Modifying the object pointed to by token (via called functions) is permitted by the Rule note.\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no code fragments need to be investigated for that rule."
