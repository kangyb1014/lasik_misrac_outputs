  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided function. I reviewed the code for common extension forms such as: GCC/clang attributes or keywords (__attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, __typeof__), Microsoft-specific keywords, inline assembler, statement expressions ({ ...; }) used as an expression, designated initializers, variable-length arrays, nonstandard integer types or suffixes, or other vendor-specific constructs. The code uses only standard C constructs: typedef names (UT_EntryKey_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t), pointer/array indexing, standard library call memcpy, size_t, and ordinary control flow. There are no prefixed identifiers or tokens that indicate a compiler extension. Therefore no fragments need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
