  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or parameters in this function violate or appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons:\n\n- LocalBuffer is declared as const void * (correct per Rule 8.13) and is used only as the read-only source to memcpy.\n- StubPtr is declared as UT_StubTableEntry_t * and is used to modify the stub table (writes to Position and a call to UT_ClearStubEntry). Because the pointed-to object is intentionally modified, the pointer must not be const.\n- The destination passed to memcpy (&StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr[StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position]) must be a modifiable pointer (non-const) because data is written into it.\n- There are no other pointer variables or pointer-typed parameters in this function that could be const-qualified without preventing required modifications.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for missing const qualification under Rule 8.13."
