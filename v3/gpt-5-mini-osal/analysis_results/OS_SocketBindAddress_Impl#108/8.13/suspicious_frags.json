  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: 'sa' is declared as a pointer to const (const struct sockaddr *sa) and is assigned from the const parameter Addr, so it already points to a const-qualified type. The function parameters 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and 'const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr' are already const-qualified. The call to strerror() is passed directly to a debug print and is an API that returns a non-const char* by definition, so there is no local pointer declaration to adjust. Non-pointer variables (os_result, addrlen) and the switch/addrlen logic do not pertain to pointer constness. Therefore only the internal-record pointer 'impl' and its subsequent use with bind warrant investigation to determine whether it could/should be a pointer to a const-qualified type."
