  "explanation": "The remaining code in OS_SocketBindAddress_Impl implements the essential control flow and side effects: retrieving the filehandle record (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)), forming the sockaddr pointer (sa = (const struct sockaddr *)&Addr->AddrData;), selecting the address length for AF_INET, the default path that yields OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, invoking bind(impl->fd, sa, addrlen) and returning OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS. Removal of any of those operations would change program behaviour (they perform the socket bind, error handling, and token lookup), so they are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2. The two flagged fragments should be investigated: the OS_DEBUG call is a no-op in the provided configuration (OS_DEBUG is defined empty) so the debug invocation (and its arguments) are effectively never executed; the AF_INET6 case is conditionally compiled and may be compiled-out or present depending on build configuration, so it should be checked whether that branch is actually reachable/executed in the project (or is compiled in but never executed). No other lines in the function appear to be dead code given the shown definitions."
