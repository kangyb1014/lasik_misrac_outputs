  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they are limited to local variable declarations, simple assignments, return statements, the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET lookup, and integer/enum comparisons \u2014 none invoke functions from <string.h> that operate on caller-supplied pointer buffers (e.g. memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn) nor perform pointer arithmetic on external buffers. The listed suspicious fragments cover the only places where a pointer to Addr->AddrData is formed and where an external function is invoked with that pointer/length (bind) as well as the call that uses a standard library string function (strerror) so no other lines present relevant risk under Rule 21.17."
