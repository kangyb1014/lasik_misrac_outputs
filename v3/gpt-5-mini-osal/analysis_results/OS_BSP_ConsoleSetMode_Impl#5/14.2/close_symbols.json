Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- OS_BSP_ExecTput (implementation): The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of a for-loop body. Even though the target function contains no for statement, any for loops inside OS_BSP_ExecTput (or side effects on objects used as loop counters) could create or violate the rule when that function is considered as part of a caller's loop body. We must inspect its implementation for any for-loops or modifications to objects that a for loop might use.\n\n- OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR (macro or function definition): This identifier is used to produce the string argument to OS_BSP_ExecTput. If it is a macro or function with side effects or internal loops, that affects whether any surrounding for-loop clauses would be free of persistent side effects and whether objects it touches are modified by loop bodies. We need its definition to rule out hidden side effects or loops.\n\n- snprintf (library implementation or model): snprintf is called inside the target function; its implementation could contain loops or modify global/state used by loops. To be conservative for MISRA analysis, the behaviour of called library functions must be known (or an appropriate model provided) to ensure no for-loop rule violations arise from them.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (definition / type, including EnableTermControl member): The code reads EnableTermControl. We must know whether this is a plain data member (no side effects on read) or if the identifier maps to a macro/function or volatile object whose read has side effects or is modified elsewhere (possibly by called functions). That matters for determining if expressions used in loop clauses have persistent side effects or if objects used as loop counters are modified outside the loop body.\n\n- OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL (macro/constant definition) and OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT (macro/constant definition): These could be plain constants or macros that expand to expressions with side effects. The MISRA rule requires that loop-clause expressions have no persistent side effects; confirming these are simple constants/macros without side effects is necessary. If they are functions/macros with side effects, that could affect compliance when those expressions are used in loop clauses.\n\nNotes: The above set targets all identifiers in the target function that can introduce hidden for-loops or side effects (called functions and macros/objects whose definitions might contain loops or modify objects). Other callers in the static call graph are not required unless the analysis later shows those callers are invoked as part of a for-loop that includes this function; in that case their implementations would also be needed."
