  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided function. The code only uses snprintf, bitwise comparisons on ModeBits, string literals passed to OS_BSP_ExecTput, and a local char buffer. None of these perform or imply a memcmp-based comparison of null-terminated strings. Calls to OS_BSP_ExecTput are external; if that function uses memcmp internally to compare null-terminated strings it would need to be inspected separately, but within the shown code there is no use of memcmp and therefore no fragments matching Rule 21.14 to report."
