Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl(uint32 ModeBits)\n{\n    char param[32];\n\n    if (OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.EnableTermControl)\n    {\n        if (ModeBits == OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"sgr0\", NULL);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ((ModeBits & OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT) == 0)\n            {\n                /* no highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"rmso\", NULL);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                /* set highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"smso\", NULL);\n            }\n\n            snprintf(param, sizeof(param), \"%d\", OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(ModeBits));\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL 0x0\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT 0x8\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(x) ((x)&0x07)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param) is executed when EnableTermControl is true and ModeBits != OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL; it sets the ANSI foreground color derived from ModeBits (via snprintf and OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR). Removing this call would change terminal appearance (or other observable behaviour performed by OS_BSP_ExecTput). Therefore, as shown, the fragment is not dead. Only in the special case where OS_BSP_ExecTput is a guaranteed no-op (has no observable effects in all builds/configurations) would this be dead code, but no evidence of that is provided."
