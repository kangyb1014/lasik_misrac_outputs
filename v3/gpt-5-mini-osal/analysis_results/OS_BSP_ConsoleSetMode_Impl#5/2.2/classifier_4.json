Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl(uint32 ModeBits)\n{\n    char param[32];\n\n    if (OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.EnableTermControl)\n    {\n        if (ModeBits == OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"sgr0\", NULL);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ((ModeBits & OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT) == 0)\n            {\n                /* no highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"rmso\", NULL);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                /* set highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"smso\", NULL);\n            }\n\n            snprintf(param, sizeof(param), \"%d\", OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(ModeBits));\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL 0x0\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT 0x8\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(x) ((x)&0x07)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_BSP_ExecTput(\"sgr0\", NULL);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"sgr0\", NULL) performs a runtime side\u2011effect (resetting terminal attributes via tput). Removing it would change the observable behavior/timing of the system (terminal appearance), so it is not dead code. It would only be dead if OS_BSP_ExecTput were a guaranteed no\u2011op (empty implementation) or the call could never be executed (e.g. EnableTermControl is provably always false), neither of which is established by the provided code."
