  "explanation": "There are no uses of the standard string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the body of OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree. The function does not perform any operations on char arrays or C-strings, nor does it pass character-buffer pointers to callees. The only pointer-like member touched is obj->name_entry, which is explicitly set to NULL (no string operations are performed on it here). Array indexing (OS_common_table[local_id + base_id]) and integer arithmetic that compute indices/IDs should of course be checked for general bounds correctness, but they are not string.h usages and thus are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this translation unit. If string.h usage compliance needs verification, that should be done by inspecting the implementations of the called functions (for example OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl, OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl, OS_ObjectIdDefined, or any other callee implementations), since any actual calls to string.h functions would occur there rather than in this function."
