  "explanation": "I limited the suspicious fragments to operations that appear to be assignments or branches that are executed but plausibly have no effect on observable behaviour and therefore merit investigation for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n\n- serial = 0; (inside the max_id == 0 branch) \u2014 when max_id == 0 the for-loop is skipped and serial is never read afterwards, so this assignment may be redundant (dead) and should be checked.\n\n- The whole if (serial >= OS_OBJECT_INDEX_MASK) { serial = local_id; } block \u2014 this branch resets serial based on local_id; depending on how serial is produced and used, this branch may never be taken or its assignment may be redundant, so it should be reviewed.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT reported:\n\n- Initialization statements at declaration (e.g., uint32 local_id = 0; and OS_common_record_t *obj = NULL;) are not candidates for dead-code per the MISRA note that initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and should not be flagged under Rule 2.2.\n\n- The default-return_code assignments (return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED; and return_code = OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS;) are control-flow initializations used as fallbacks if no free id is found; they are meaningful unless proven otherwise and so are not flagged here.\n\n- Assignments and updates performed when a free slot is found (token->obj_idx = ..., OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl(...), obj->active_id = ..., obj->name_entry = NULL, obj->creator = OS_TaskGetId(), obj->refcount = 0, objtype_state->last_id_issued = token->obj_id) affect system state (object table, creator id, refcount, last issued id) and therefore are likely functional, not dead. They should not be considered dead without broader context showing those fields are never used.\n\n- The failure-case token updates (token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(-1); token->obj_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;) ensure a consistent token on error and are semantically meaningful.\n\nIf you want, I can expand the investigation by showing how these suspicious fragments could be proven dead (e.g., by analyzing possible ranges of serial, max_id, and how OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl and OS_OBJECT_INDEX_MASK interact) or by searching for callers/uses of the modified fields to confirm necessity."
