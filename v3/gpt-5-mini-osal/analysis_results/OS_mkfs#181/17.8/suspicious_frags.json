  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in OS_mkfs. There are no assignments to any parameter (e.g. no statements like address = ... , devname = ... , volname = ... , blocksize = ... , or numblocks = ...), nor any increment/decrement or pointer reassignments. The parameters are only passed as arguments to OS_FileSys_Initialize; passing a pointer parameter to another function does not violate Rule 17.8 here (the rule allows the object pointed to be modified, but forbids reassigning the pointer parameter itself). Additionally, devname and volname are declared const char * so the function cannot modify the pointed-to objects within OS_mkfs. The macro definitions provided are just constant error codes and do not alter parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
