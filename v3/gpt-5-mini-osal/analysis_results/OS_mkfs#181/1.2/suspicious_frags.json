  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. I inspected the code for known extension constructs (examples: identifiers with double underscores or leading underscores followed by a capital letter, GCC/Clang attributes like __attribute__, MSVC __declspec, inline assembly (asm/__asm__), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, compiler-specific pragmas, or other vendor-specific keywords) and found none. The identifiers int32 and osal_blockcount_t appear to be typedefs (not language extensions), size_t and true are standard C library/boolean identifiers (stdbool.h and stddef.h in standard C), and the use of preprocessor #define numeric macros is standard C. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
