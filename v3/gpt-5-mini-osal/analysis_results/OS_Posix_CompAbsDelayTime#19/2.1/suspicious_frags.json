  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function is demonstrably unreachable. Reasoning by statement:\n\n- clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, tm); is executed unconditionally at function entry and therefore reachable. (Whether tm is NULL is a runtime error but it does not make the call unreachable.)\n\n- tm->tv_sec += (time_t)(msecs / 1000); and tm->tv_nsec += (msecs % 1000) * 1000000L; are unconditional assignments immediately following the clock_gettime call and thus reachable.\n\n- The conditional if (tm->tv_nsec >= 1000000000L) is not provably always false or always true: tv_nsec returned by clock_gettime is in the range 0..999999999 and the added residue ((msecs % 1000) * 1,000,000) can be as large as 999,000,000, so the sum can be <1,000,000,000 or >=1,000,000,000 depending on inputs and current time. Therefore both the if branch and its else path are reachable in some circumstances; the body of the if (the subtraction and the tm->tv_sec++ ) is likewise reachable.\n\n- There are no return statements, goto labels, or static conditions that would render any statements unreachable at compile time.\n\nBecause no portion of the code is provably unreachable under the C semantics and realistic ranges of timespec fields and msecs, there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want to investigate runtime error conditions (e.g., tm == NULL or clock_gettime failures) those are defensiveness/robustness issues but not instances of unreachable code."
