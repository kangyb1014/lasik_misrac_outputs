  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check the MISRA rule (memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings):\n\n- clock_gettime: the only function called by OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime; verify it does not expand/inline code that uses memcmp in this translation unit or via macros.  (Unlikely, but required to prove absence of memcmp usage in the target function.)\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: macro argument passed to clock_gettime; included to inspect any surprising macro side\u2011effects (macro expansions that could introduce string comparisons).\n\n- struct timespec: the target operates on this type; checking its definition ensures tv_sec/tv_nsec are not typedefs to character types or wrappers that could cause use of memcmp on strings.\n\n- tv_sec, tv_nsec: the members accessed/modified by the function; ensure their types and any accessor macros do not perform or hide memcmp calls or string operations.\n\n- time_t: verify that time_t is an arithmetic type (not an alias to a pointer or string type) so arithmetic operations are safe and not masking string comparisons.\n\n- uint32 (or the concrete typedef used for msecs): confirm the parameter is an integer type (not a pointer to char or string) so there is no hidden string comparison via memcmp.\n\n- 1000000000L / 1000000L (numeric constants): included to confirm arithmetic is purely numeric and not macros that could expand to string operations.\n\n- memcmp: the symbol under the MISRA rule; must be inspected in this translation unit and project to see whether it is used directly or via a macro alias. If memcmp is present in the TU or redefined, determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- string.h (or any header that may declare/define memcmp): to check whether memcmp is included, or whether project headers redefine memcmp (e.g., as an inline or macro) that could be misused on strings.\n\n- any macro named memcmp (project-level redefinitions): project code sometimes #define or inline standard functions\u2014these redefinitions must be checked to ensure they are not used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_QueueGet_Impl: immediate callers from the static call graph. Include them to ensure the broader context does not cause OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime to be inlined or transformed into code that uses memcmp on strings, and to allow a call\u2011chain review (some analyses treat caller context when checking MISRA violations).\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: additional related symbols appearing in the call graph for callers; include to inspect whether any surrounding APIs in the same compilation unit or inlined code introduce memcmp usage that could be associated with OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime.\n\nIn short: include the standard/time symbols to prove the target function performs only numeric/time operations, include memcmp and related headers/macros to detect any direct or hidden uses of memcmp in the translation unit or project, and include immediate callers/inlined relatives to ensure no indirect/inlined memcmp usage affects the target function for the MISRA rule check."
