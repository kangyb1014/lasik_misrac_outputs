  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed all provided code fragments (OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and the additional functions). There are no occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any obvious macros or wrapper calls that expand to memcmp. The only memory/string-related call present is memset(&ts, 0, sizeof(ts)), which does not compare null-terminated strings. Because the MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and no memcmp usage (direct or apparent indirect) was found in the supplied code, there are no fragments that need to be investigated for this rule."
