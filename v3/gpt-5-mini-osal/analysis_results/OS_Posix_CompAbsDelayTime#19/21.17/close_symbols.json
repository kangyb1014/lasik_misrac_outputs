  "explanation": "clock_gettime: The function is called with the tm pointer. To be sure no string.h function is invoked (directly or indirectly) that could write beyond the object pointed to by tm, the clock_gettime prototype and, if available, its implementation must be inspected. Also confirm its expected write-size for struct timespec.\n\nstruct timespec: The layout and member types (tv_sec, tv_nsec) determine how much storage is required for tm and whether subsequent writes (by clock_gettime or by this function) could exceed the object's bounds.\n\ntime_t: The type of tv_sec can affect signedness/size and thus how arithmetic and increments behave; need its definition to reason about correct accesses and whether any casts could mask out-of-bounds pointer usage.\n\nCLOCK_REALTIME: The macro/constant passed to clock_gettime; include to inspect whether any wrapper or platform-specific implementation treats this value specially and might call string functions or perform extra memory writes.\n\nuint32 (typedef): The signature uses uint32 for msecs. Knowing the exact typedef (width, signed/unsigned) is needed to reason about the arithmetic (division, modulo, multiplication) and to ensure no implicit conversions produce unexpected pointer/size computations that could lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses.\n\nOS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_QueueGet_Impl: These three functions are the callers of OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime (per the static call graph). To determine whether tm passed into OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime can point to an object smaller than struct timespec or to memory that could be affected by string functions elsewhere, their prototypes/implementations must be checked to see how they obtain/allocate the timespec and what they pass as tm.\n\nOS_ObjectIndexFromToken: This helper is called by two of the callers (per the call graph). Its implementation may influence how objects or pointers (including any timespec storage) are obtained/validated by the callers; include it to trace the provenance and sizing of the tm argument.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule in question concerns use of string.h functions that can access beyond object bounds. The target function itself does not call any string functions, but it passes and writes through a pointer (tm) and calls clock_gettime. To be certain there is no indirect use of string functions or writes beyond the bounds of the object referenced by tm, you must inspect the called routine(s) (clock_gettime) and the callers (to verify the origin and size of the tm object). The listed symbols are the minimal set required to perform that analysis."
