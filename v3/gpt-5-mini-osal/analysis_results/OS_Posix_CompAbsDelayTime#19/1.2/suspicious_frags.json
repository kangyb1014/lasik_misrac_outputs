  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs and POSIX APIs: a function call (clock_gettime), a pointer to struct timespec, simple arithmetic, an explicit cast to time_t, integer literals with the standard long suffix (L), and member access (tm->tv_sec, tm->tv_nsec). The typedef uint32 references uint32_t which is a standard fixed-width integer type. There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions present (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, __int128, inline assembler, or other vendor-specific syntax). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
