  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is only a declaration of UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf; it does not call any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The surrounding use of vsnprintf (from <stdio.h>) writes into Buf.Text with sizeof(Buf.Text) as the limit, so the declaration itself does not cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. (A potential runtime violation could only occur if Buf.Text is incorrectly sized or sizeof(Buf.Text) is wrong, but that is not shown in the fragment.)"
