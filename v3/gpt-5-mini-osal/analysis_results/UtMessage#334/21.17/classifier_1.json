  "scenario": "The call to vsnprintf itself is safe if sizeof(Buf.Text) actually equals the real size of the character array and is > 0 (vsnprintf will not write beyond the provided size). Therefore the fragment does not inherently violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation scenario would occur if sizeof(Buf.Text) does not represent the true size of the destination buffer \u2014 for example, if UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t declares Text as a char * and sizeof(Buf.Text) yields the size of a pointer (e.g. 4 or 8) while the dynamically allocated buffer pointed to by Text is smaller than that value (or smaller than the formatted output). In that case vsnprintf could write past the actual allocated object and so would violate Rule 21.17."
