  "explanation": "Only the fragments that perform or rely on buffer writes/reads are flagged. The declaration of UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf is flagged because the actual definition of that type (and the real size/array-vs-pointer nature of Buf.Text) is not shown here \u2014 if Buf.Text is a pointer or its size is smaller than assumed, subsequent uses can produce out-of-bounds accesses. The call to vsnprintf(...) is flagged because it writes formatted data into Buf.Text using sizeof(Buf.Text) as the size argument; this can lead to out-of-bounds writes if sizeof(Buf.Text) does not reflect the actual writable size of the object, or if vsnprintf semantics are misused. The UT_BSP_DoText(...) call is flagged because it reads Buf.Text; if the buffer is not properly null-terminated or was overflowed, this read may access beyond the object bounds.\n\nOther fragments are not flagged because they do not themselves perform string/buffer writes or pointer-based memory accesses relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17: the function signature (parameters MessageType, File, Line, Spec) merely declares inputs; the va_list declaration and the va_start/va_end macros manage variadic argument processing but do not directly write into the destination buffer; and there are no other string.h library calls (e.g., memcpy/strcpy/etc.) in the shown code. Therefore, only the three presented fragments require investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
