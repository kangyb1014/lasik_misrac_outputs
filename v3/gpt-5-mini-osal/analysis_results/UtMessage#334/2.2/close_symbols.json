The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For determining whether UtMessage is dead code you must know whether its observable effects (and their side-effects) would change program behaviour if removed. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: This is the direct callee of UtMessage. Need the implementation/signature to know what observable effects (I/O, state changes, shutdown, timing, synchronization) it performs. If UT_BSP_DoText has no observable effect, UtMessage might be dead; if it does, UtMessage is not dead.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock: UT_BSP_DoText calls these according to the call graph. Lock/unlock can affect concurrency, ordering and timing (shared state protection). Their semantics determine whether the call sequence has behavioural impact beyond mere printing.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: The concrete console output routine \u2014 required to determine if output affects hardware, global state, device buffers, timing, or error/state flags (observable behaviour).\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: If DoText changes console mode, that can affect subsequent program behaviour (I/O semantics/timing). Need to know when and how it is used.\n\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Appears in the DoText call graph; if called (directly or indirectly) this is a definite observable effect (shutdown) and means UtMessage is not dead.\n\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: Called by DoText per the call graph; even if it appears to only read state, it may access global/test-case state or have side-effects; confirm its behaviour.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (definition): UtMessage creates this stack buffer and writes formatted text into it. Need the exact type/layout so you can determine whether buffer writes have any side-effects (e.g., overlap with volatile memory, special sections) or potential UB that changes behaviour.\n\n- Buf.Text size / buffer-size macro: The size determines whether truncation/overflow could occur and whether formatted output length influences downstream behaviour (timing, partial messages). vsnprintf behavior depends on buffer size.\n\n- vsnprintf (stdio): While normally purely formatting, you must confirm there are no project-specific overrides or side-effects (e.g., locale/global errno updates) that could make the formatting operation observable.\n\n- Any global variables read/written by UT_BSP_DoText and its callees: List the actual global symbols those functions access (console state, shutdown flags, locks, test-case state). Global state accesses are the main source of observable behaviour changes when code is removed.\n\n- Configuration macros that alter UT_BSP_DoText behaviour (build-time flags): Compile-time switches can make DoText no-op in some builds. To conclude dead code you must know if such flags can render DoText a no-op in the target build.\n\nProviding the implementations/signatures of the above symbols (and the names of any globals used) is sufficient to decide whether removing UtMessage would change program behaviour and thus whether it violates MISRA C dead-code rule."
