  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for analyzing unreachable-code (MISRA) for UtMessage:\n\n1) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t\n   - The function instantiates a UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (Buf). To be sure no part of the function is syntactically removed or becomes unreachable due to an unusual type definition (for example, a type defined as an empty struct via macros, or with unusual attributes), the actual type definition must be examined.\n\n2) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t::Text (member) / buffer size\n   - The code writes into Buf.Text using vsnprintf with sizeof(Buf.Text). If Buf.Text does not exist (e.g. conditional compilation) or has a size of zero (flexible/zero-length array or macro-altered), that could indicate the implementation is different than it appears and could affect control flow or detectability of unreachable writes. Confirming the member and its size rules out such surprises.\n\n3) vsnprintf\n   - The call to vsnprintf is a potential point that could be implemented as a macro or annotated with attributes (e.g. noreturn) in some platforms. If vsnprintf were replaced by a macro or non-returning function, subsequent code could become unreachable. Confirming the actual symbol/implementation ensures normal return behavior.\n\n4) va_list / va_start / va_end (stdarg.h)\n   - These are macros/typedefs that affect function prologue/epilogue behaviour. On some toolchains they could be defined in ways that affect control flow or expand to constructs that change reachability analysis. Verify standard behavior to rule out hidden non-returning or conditional-control constructs.\n\n5) UT_BSP_DoText\n   - This is the final call in UtMessage. If UT_BSP_DoText is a macro, is annotated noreturn, or conditionally compiled out, it can affect what code paths are actually present or reachable. Even though there are no statements after it in this function, its signature/attributes and how it expands are necessary to conclude there is no unreachable code in the function's body (or to detect unreachable code introduced by its expansion).\n\n6) UtMessage linkage/visibility (static vs extern) and its declarations\n   - MISRA\u2019s unreachable-code rule is about code that can never be executed in the project. To know whether UtMessage itself is reachable you must know its linkage/visibility: if it is declared static in another translation unit, or if the symbol is intentionally unused, that influences whether the function (and thus its body) is unreachable. The source-level declaration and storage-class must be checked.\n\n7) Project-wide callers / references to UtMessage (whole-program call graph or symbol-table entries)\n   - The local static call-graph supplied shows no callers. To determine whether UtMessage is actually unreachable in the whole project you need the complete set of references (including indirect references via function-pointer tables, registration APIs, or other translation units). Without the whole-program callers list or symbol-table, you cannot conclude whether the function is truly unreachable.\n\n8) Relevant preprocessor macros that can change UtMessage body (e.g. any macro that redefines vsnprintf, UT_BSP_DoText, or UtMessage)\n   - Preprocessor definitions can alter the compiled body (e.g., turning calls into nothing, replacing them with longjmp/exit, or removing the function). To be certain the source shown is the effective code being compiled, you must know any macros that affect the names used in the function (vsnprintf, UT_BSP_DoText, or UtMessage itself) or configuration switches that conditionally compile parts of the function.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions (type definitions, function definitions/attributes, linkage and whole-program references, and relevant macros) is necessary to determine whether any portion of UtMessage's body is unreachable under the project build and runtime assumptions."
