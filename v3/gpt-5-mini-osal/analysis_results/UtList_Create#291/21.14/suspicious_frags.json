  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no call to memcmp (or any other string-comparison function). The only standard-library calls are malloc and memset (memset is used to zero memory, not to compare strings). There are no operations on null-terminated strings (no char buffers, no string.h calls such as strcmp/strncmp/memcmp/strcpy), so there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 21.14 to investigate."
