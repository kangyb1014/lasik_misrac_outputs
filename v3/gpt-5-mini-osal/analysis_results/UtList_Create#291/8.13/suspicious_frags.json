  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not considered suspicious for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they are either non-pointer entities or clearly used in a context that requires a mutable (non-const) object:\n- Scalar declarations and arithmetic (NumTags, i, ActualSize, uint32, sizeof expressions) are not pointers and thus outside the scope of the rule.\n- The flexible-array member (Tags[] inside the allocator struct) is not a pointer type and therefore not applicable to pointer-to-const qualification.\n- Memory allocation and initialization operations (malloc call, the cast from void*, memset) are allocation/initialization mechanisms; the pointer returned from allocation is intended to refer to modifiable storage and the cast/use of void* is an allocation idiom rather than a missing const qualification.\n- Assignments to integral members and loop-based initialization of node fields (setting numeric tags, Next/Prev/other fields) show that the objects are intended to be modified, so adding const to those pointer targets would be inappropriate.\nThese reasons justify why other code fragments were not included for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
