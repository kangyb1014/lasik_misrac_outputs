  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Create:\n```c\nUtListHead_t *UtList_Create(uint32 NumTags)\n{\n    struct ListAllocator\n    {\n        UtListHead_t Head;\n        UtListNode_t Tags[];\n    };\n    struct ListAllocator *NewList;\n    UtListNode_t *        TagHead;\n    size_t                ActualSize;\n    uint32                i;\n\n    ActualSize = sizeof(struct ListAllocator) + (sizeof(UtListNode_t) * NumTags);\n    NewList    = (struct ListAllocator *)malloc(ActualSize);\n\n    memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n\n    NewList->Head.Tags         = NewList->Tags;\n    NewList->Head.NumberOfTags = NumTags;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < NumTags; ++i)\n    {\n        TagHead       = &NewList->Head.Tags[i];\n        TagHead->Tag  = i;\n        TagHead->Next = TagHead;\n        TagHead->Prev = TagHead;\n    }\n\n    return &NewList->Head;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for the provided fragment as written: the memset may be required to zero any fields not explicitly written later (other members of UtListHead_t or UtListNode_t, padding bytes, or future added fields) and to ensure deterministic initial state. However, a concrete violation scenario would be: if UtListHead_t contains only the two members set here (Tags and NumberOfTags) and UtListNode_t contains only Tag, Next and Prev (all of which are explicitly assigned in the loop), then memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize) would be redundant \u2014 its removal would not change program behaviour, and thus would constitute dead code."
