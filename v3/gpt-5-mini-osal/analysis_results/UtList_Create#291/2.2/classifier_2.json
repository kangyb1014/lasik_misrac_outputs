Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Create:\n```c\nUtListHead_t *UtList_Create(uint32 NumTags)\n{\n    struct ListAllocator\n    {\n        UtListHead_t Head;\n        UtListNode_t Tags[];\n    };\n    struct ListAllocator *NewList;\n    UtListNode_t *        TagHead;\n    size_t                ActualSize;\n    uint32                i;\n\n    ActualSize = sizeof(struct ListAllocator) + (sizeof(UtListNode_t) * NumTags);\n    NewList    = (struct ListAllocator *)malloc(ActualSize);\n\n    memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n\n    NewList->Head.Tags         = NewList->Tags;\n    NewList->Head.NumberOfTags = NumTags;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < NumTags; ++i)\n    {\n        TagHead       = &NewList->Head.Tags[i];\n        TagHead->Tag  = i;\n        TagHead->Next = TagHead;\n        TagHead->Prev = TagHead;\n    }\n\n    return &NewList->Head;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nNewList->Head.Tags         = NewList->Tags;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment NewList->Head.Tags = NewList->Tags; sets the Head.Tags pointer to the flexible array Tags and is used immediately afterwards (TagHead = &NewList->Head.Tags[i]) to initialize each tag. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (the subsequent accesses would use an incorrect/zeroed pointer), so the operation is not dead code."
