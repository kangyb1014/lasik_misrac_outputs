  "explanation": "For deciding whether any statement in UtList_Create is provably unreachable you must know the types, call sites and runtime/ABI behavior that can make particular paths or statements impossible. Each listed symbol is required for that reasoning:\n\n- UtListHead_t: The function returns &NewList->Head and writes NewList->Head.Tags and NumberOfTags. You need the full definition to know field names, types and whether Head.Tags is actually a pointer/array or otherwise (which affects whether those assignments are well\u2011formed and reachable). Also needed to determine whether returning &NewList->Head can ever be invalid or optimized away.\n\n- UtListNode_t: The loop indexes NewList->Head.Tags and assigns Tag, Next and Prev. The node layout (types of Tag/Next/Prev) and size determine whether indexing is meaningful for any NumTags and whether the assignments could be undefined (which affects reachability reasoning in static analysis).\n\n- UtTest_EarlyInit: Static call graph shows this is the only caller. You must inspect its implementation (and any constants it passes) to know whether UtList_Create can ever be called with NumTags values that make the loop body reachable. If the caller always passes a fixed value (e.g. 0) the loop body could be unreachable in the whole project.\n\n- malloc: Allocation semantics matter. Some projects replace malloc with an allocator that never returns (e.g. aborts on failure) or with a macro that changes control flow; knowing the actual malloc used determines whether statements after the malloc are reachable when allocation fails. Also its prototype (return type) is needed to reason about casting and nullability.\n\n- memset: Though typically not affecting reachability, an alternative implementation (or macro) could have side effects or never return; you must confirm standard semantics to decide if code after memset is reachable.\n\n- typedef uint32 (definition of uint32): The parameter NumTags and loop variable i use uint32. You must know whether uint32 is unsigned 32\u2011bit and its value domain to reason about the loop condition (i < NumTags), possible wrap/underflow/overflow and whether some iterations are impossible.\n\n- typedef size_t (definition of size_t): ActualSize is size_t and is computed from sizeof and a multiplication that could overflow. You need size_t width and semantics to determine whether the allocation size computation can wrap and make later code undefined or unreachable.\n\n- SIZE_MAX / UINT32_MAX (limits.h macros): To reason about potential integer overflow in ActualSize = sizeof(...) + sizeof(UtListNode_t) * NumTags and whether certain NumTags values make that computation impossible/undefined, you need the platform limits.\n\n(If the project uses alternative allocator or wrapper symbols instead of the standard malloc/memset, include those wrapper symbols in place of malloc/memset.)"
