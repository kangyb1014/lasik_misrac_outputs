  "explanation": "No obvious instances of dead code were found in the provided OS_cp function or the supplied related definitions. I reviewed likely candidates and explain why they are not dead and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2:\n\n- Initialization of file1 and file2 to OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED: these initializations are executed and are required. If an open call is not made for a descriptor (e.g. file2 if the first open fails), the subsequent OS_ObjectIdDefined(fileX) test must operate on a defined value \u2014 omitting the initialization could leave an uninitialized object id and cause undefined behavior. Even though OS_OpenCreate sets *filedes = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED at its start, that only applies when the function is invoked; the local initializations are therefore not dead.\n\n- The initial return_code assignment (via OS_OpenCreate) and the subsequent while (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) loop: these control flow operations are executed and affect program behavior (they determine whether reading/writing occurs). The read/write loops update return_code on errors and break on EOF; removal or alteration would change behaviour.\n\n- The inner write loop (wr_total/wr_size): these statements perform the actual write retries to ensure all bytes are written. Removing them would change program semantics on partial writes, so they are not dead.\n\n- Conditional closes guarded by OS_ObjectIdDefined(fileX): these close operations are executed only when the descriptors are valid; the checks are meaningful and their removal could cause invalid closes or leaks, so they are not dead.\n\n- Use of helper functions/macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_read/OS_write wrappers, OS_OpenCreate, OS_close, etc.): these calls are executed and their side effects (error checking, I/O, object-table management) are required for correct behavior. Even if some macros expand to different implementations in different builds, in the presented code they are used and not redundant.\n\n- Declarations and buffer (copyblock[OS_CP_BLOCK_SIZE]) and local temporaries (rd_size, wr_size, wr_total): all are used in the read/write logic; none are unused statements that could be removed without effect.\n\nGiven the above, there are no executed operations in the presented code that appear removable without affecting program behaviour. Therefore no code fragments warrant investigation specifically for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
