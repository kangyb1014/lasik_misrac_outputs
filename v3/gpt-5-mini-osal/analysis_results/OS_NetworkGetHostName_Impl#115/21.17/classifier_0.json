  "scenario": "The statement host_name[0] = 0; itself is not a use of any <string.h> function, so it does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which targets the standard string.h functions). In the provided call chain the wrapper OS_NetworkGetHostName performs OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name) and OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) before calling the implementation, so under normal use the buffer is guaranteed to be non-NULL and have size >= 1 and the write to host_name[0] is safe. \n\nPossible violation scenario: if OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl (or the host_name[0] = 0; statement) were invoked without ensuring host_name is non-NULL and name_len >= 1 (e.g. caller passes name_len == 0 or omits the checks), the write would access beyond the bounds of the object (or dereference NULL) and thus would constitute an out-of-bounds access (a condition Rule 21.17 aims to prevent for string operations)."
