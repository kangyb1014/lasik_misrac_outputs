  "explanation": "For determining whether any part of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl is unreachable you must know external definitions/constraints that could make either branch of the if/else impossible at compile time or by project-specific replacement: \n\n- gethostname: The return values of gethostname determine which branch (if block or else block) can be taken. You need the function prototype and implementation (or its compile-time attributes) to see if it can ever return >=0 or <0, or whether it is annotated as non-returning (noreturn) or is replaced by a stub that forces a single outcome.\n\n- gethostname (project headers / any macro wrapper that might replace it): Many projects define wrappers or macros that replace system calls. If gethostname is a macro or inline wrapper in project headers that always returns a constant or is annotated with attributes, that could make one branch unreachable. Explicitly check any project-level alias/define.\n\n- OS_ERROR: The macro/enum value (and whether it is defined as an expression with side effects) must be known to ensure the return statement is ordinary code and not something that would prevent following code from being reachable in a compile-time sense.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Same rationale as OS_ERROR \u2014 its definition could be more than a simple constant and could affect reachability analysis if it contains unusual constructs (macros with control flow, etc.).\n\n- int32 (typedef): Knowing the exact typedef (e.g., signedness/width) is needed to confirm the function's return type and whether any conversions or attributes on the type could affect control-flow analysis (rare but relevant for strict static MISRA checks).\n\n- size_t (typedef): The code writes host_name[name_len - 1]; if name_len is a value whose domain is constrained by callers (e.g., always >0) then that write might be unreachable or undefined. Knowing the definition and any project constraints or typedefs for size_t helps to reason about compile-time guarantees.\n\n- OS_NetworkGetHostName: This wrapper/caller may impose preconditions (constant arguments, checks, or instrumentation/stubs via UT_... functions shown in the call graph) that guarantee particular values for name_len or force gethostname to always succeed/fail. You must inspect its implementation and any test-stub interactions to determine whether any branch in the Impl function can be proven unreachable in the project context.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether either the 'if (gethostname(...) < 0)' branch or the 'else' branch (including the host_name[name_len - 1] write) can be proven impossible at compile time or by project-specific replacements \u2014 which is required to decide if the code contains unreachable code per MISRA."
