  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I inspected the function and related definitions for common compiler-specific extensions (examples: GCC nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, __asm__/asm, inline assembly, __extension__, __builtin_*, compiler-specific pragmas, or other non-standard tokens). None appear.\n\nSpecific notes:\n- gethostname is a POSIX API call, not a compiler language extension; its use does not violate Rule 1.2 as stated (the rule targets language/compiler extensions documented by compilers).\n- int32 is a typedef for the standard int32_t type (from <stdint.h>), which is standard C; the typedef itself is not a compiler extension.\n- The macros OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS are plain preprocessor defines and not compiler extensions.\n- There is no use of inline assembly, compiler-specific attributes, builtin functions, or any compiler-specific syntax in the code.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments requiring further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
