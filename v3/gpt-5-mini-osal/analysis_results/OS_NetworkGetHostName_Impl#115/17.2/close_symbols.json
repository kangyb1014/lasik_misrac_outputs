  "explanation": "To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion you must examine all functions that call or are called (transitively) from the target. Reasons per symbol:\n- OS_NetworkGetHostName: the immediate caller of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl; inspect it for any call paths that could lead back to the Impl (or to OS_NetworkGetHostName itself).\n- OS_printf: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName; verify it does not call back into OS_NetworkGetHostName or OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName; verify it does not call back into the above functions creating a cycle.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName; verify it does not call back into the above functions creating a cycle.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName; this testing/stub handler is the most likely place for indirect callbacks\u2014must be checked for calls back to OS_NetworkGetHostName or OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl.\n- UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName; verify it does not call back into the subject functions.\n- gethostname: called by OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl (external/system function); confirm it cannot call back into program functions (to rule out an indirect recursion source).\n\nInspecting these symbols and their transitive callees ensures there is no path that returns control to OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl or OS_NetworkGetHostName (i.e., no direct or indirect self-call as prohibited by the MISRA rule)."
