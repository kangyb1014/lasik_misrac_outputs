  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found relating to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters in the provided code are the host_name arguments of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl and OS_NetworkGetHostName. Both are used as output buffers (calls gethostname(host_name, ...), explicitly write host_name[name_len - 1] = 0, and on error set host_name[0] = 0). Because the pointed-to data is intentionally modified, these pointers must not be const-qualified; therefore they do not violate the requirement that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible. No other pointer objects or parameters appear in the provided fragments that could be made const."
