  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C Rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d analysis:\n\n- fopen: The first if uses the assignment (fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")). To judge whether that controlling expression can be invariant you must know fopen's prototype and run-time semantics (it may return NULL on failure or a non-NULL FILE* on success). If fopen were a macro or a wrapper with deterministic/constant return in the build under analysis that could make the expression invariant.\n\n- fread: The second controlling expression is (fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) == 1). You need fread's prototype and semantics (returning the number of items read) to determine if the comparison can be constant (for example because of a guarantee about Length, size arguments, or an overridden implementation).\n\n- fclose: Although not part of a controlling expression, fclose participates in the same I/O sequence; its presence can affect library state/side effects in some implementations. Include its prototype/semantics to be thorough when reasoning about whether earlier calls could be effectively invariant in the target environment.\n\n- FILE: The type returned by fopen and consumed by fread/fclose; you need the definition/context to know whether FILE is an opaque runtime object (normal case) or something that could be transformed/constant by the build.\n\n- size_t: fread returns and accepts size_t; knowing the exact type and width is necessary to reason about comparisons and whether any implicit conversions could yield an invariant result.\n\n- NULL (pointer zero macro): The if (fp = fopen(...)) relies on pointer-to-zero truth testing. Knowing how NULL is defined in the analyzed environment (0, ((void*)0), etc.) and usual pointer-to-Boolean conversion rules is needed to determine invariance.\n\n- pointer-to-boolean conversion (C semantics): You must apply the standard C rule that non-NULL pointers evaluate true and NULL false; this is necessary to decide whether (fp = fopen(...)) is a constant-true/false expression in the analyzed context.\n\n- fread semantics when size==0: The behavior of fread when size (here Length) is zero is specified by the C standard (it returns 0 and does not modify the buffer). That special-case behavior can make the controlling expression (== 1) always false if Length can be zero, so it is essential to know for invariance analysis.\n\n- errno: fopen/fread may set errno on failure; errno is read by strerror in the UtAssert message. While not part of a controlling expression, knowledge of errno (object/macro semantics) matters when reasoning about whether fopen/fread are turned into no-ops or deterministic macros in the analyzed build.\n\n- strerror: Used in the UtAssert_Failed call. Not a controlling expression itself, but include its semantics to ensure the error-path call isn't replacing or affecting the controlling-expression behavior (e.g., via macros or instrumentation that could make fopen invariant).\n\n- uint32 (project typedef): Length is a uint32; you must know its signedness/width (and whether it can be zero or constrained) to reason whether fread(...)==1 can ever be true or is invariant false/true for all possible Length values in the analyzed context.\n\n- bool (stdbool.h): The function returns bool and uses boolean values; include to know representation and potential implicit conversions when relating controlling expressions to Boolean results.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: The else branch calls this function. Include its declaration/semantics to check whether it might be implemented (or macro-expanded) in a way that changes/control-wraps the fopen call (e.g., instrumentation that short-circuits fopen), which could affect whether the controlling expression is invariant.\n\nNotes: The heart of the MISRA check here is whether (fp = fopen(...)) or (fread(... ) == 1) can be evaluated at compile time as an invariant true/false. The required symbols above give the prototypes and run-time semantics (including corner cases like zero-length reads, macro replacements, and possible build-time overrides) needed to decide that."
