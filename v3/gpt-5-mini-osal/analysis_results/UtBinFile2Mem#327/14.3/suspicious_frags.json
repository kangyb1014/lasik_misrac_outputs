  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. The only control statements are:\n- if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\"))) \u2014 the controlling expression depends on the runtime result of fopen and is not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) == 1) \u2014 the controlling expression depends on the runtime result of fread and is not an invariant.\nThere are no loops (no for/while/do-while) with constant conditions, and therefore none of the exceptions for Rule 14.3 are applicable. The UtAssert_Failed macro expands to a function call with a constant false argument, but that is an argument expression, not a controlling expression in this function, so it does not trigger Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
