  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- strerror: The target calls strerror(errno) and this function is declared in <string.h>. To decide if any string handling rule is violated we must know strerror's return semantics (null-termination, lifetime, whether it may read/write caller-supplied buffers).\n\n- errno: The value passed into strerror can affect the produced message; include errno to trace the call and ensure strerror is used only as a read-only, null-terminated string (no pointer-parameter bounds issue inside UtBinFile2Mem itself but relevant to downstream formatting).\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: The target forwards Filename and the strerror result to UtAssert_Failed using %s. We must inspect UtAssert_Failed's implementation to see how it consumes those char* arguments (e.g., whether it uses unsafe string functions or copies strings into buffers without bounds checks). This determines whether passing the strings from UtBinFile2Mem can lead to out-of-bounds accesses of the objects referenced by string pointers.\n\n- snprintf, vsnprintf, sprintf, vsprintf: These are the common printf-family formatting functions UtAssert_Failed might call. If UtAssert_Failed uses any of these (or their variants) to format messages, we must know which one and how it is used (destination buffer sizes, truncation behavior) to determine potential out-of-bounds string accesses.\n\n- strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat: These are typical <string.h> copy/concatenation functions that could be used inside UtAssert_Failed (or helpers). If UtAssert_Failed uses them to assemble the error string, we need to verify correct length checks and NUL-termination to ensure no out-of-bounds access.\n\n- memcpy, memmove: These non-character-copy routines are sometimes used to manipulate message buffers. If UtAssert_Failed or its helpers use them on the strings passed from UtBinFile2Mem, their size arguments must be checked to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- strlen: Often used to compute lengths before copying/concatenation. If UtAssert_Failed uses strlen on the pointers passed (Filename, strerror result) and then uses that length in a subsequent copy, we must ensure the strlen usage and subsequent operations do not cause reads/writes beyond the referenced objects.\n\nIn short: UtBinFile2Mem itself does not call the typical string.h functions listed in the MISRA rule except strerror, but it passes two strings into UtAssert_Failed. To determine compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule we therefore need the declaration/semantics of strerror and the implementation/signature of UtAssert_Failed and any string handling library functions that UtAssert_Failed (or helpers it calls) uses (the common candidates are listed above)."
