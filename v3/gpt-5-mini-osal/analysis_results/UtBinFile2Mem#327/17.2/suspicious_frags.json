  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect recursion. Only function calls (or macro expansions that result in function calls) can create such recursion. The fragments listed above cover all function-call expressions and the assertion macro definition present in the provided code that could lead to an indirect call chain back to UtBinFile2Mem. Other parts of the code do not contain function calls or call expressions (variable declarations, assignments such as Success = false;, the return Success; statement, and simple control-structure syntax) and therefore cannot be the source of direct or indirect recursion and do not need investigation. Also, the provided UtAssert_GetContext implementation simply returns DefaultContext and contains no calls, so it is not a recursion risk and need not be investigated further."
