  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension usage:\n\n- bool / true / false: These identifiers may be macros or typedefs that map to the C99 _Bool/stdbool.h definitions or to a compiler-specific extension. To determine compliance you must inspect their actual definitions (macro/typedef) to ensure no non-standard extension is used.\n\n- uint32: This is not a standard C type name (standard is uint32_t). It may be a typedef alias (from a project header) or a compiler-specific builtin/type alias; you must check its definition to confirm it is a standard typedef and does not rely on an extension (e.g., compiler-specific width attributes or non-portable typedefs).\n\n- FILE: The implementation of FILE is platform-dependent; some libraries expose implementation-specific fields or use compiler extensions. Inspecting the FILE type (from the C library headers in use) confirms whether any non-standard extensions are referenced indirectly by using FILE pointers.\n\n- size_t: fread's prototype uses size_t. You must confirm the definition of size_t comes from the standard header (stddef.h) and does not rely on an extension or unusual compiler-provided type.\n\n- fopen / fread / fclose: The function prototypes could be standard C library functions, but project headers or platform wrappers might redefine them (macros, inline wrappers, attributes). Check their declarations to ensure no compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __attribute__ markers, non-standard calling conventions) are present.\n\n- strerror: Often implemented in the C library but sometimes wrapped; its declaration or wrapper could use thread-local or other extensions. Inspect to ensure it is a standard function signature and not an extension.\n\n- errno: errno is typically a macro that may expand to a function call or thread-local accessor (e.g., __errno_location(), __thread), which can be a compiler extension. You must inspect errno's definition to determine whether it relies on extensions.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: This project-specific assertion routine (called in the else branch) could be implemented as a macro, variadic macro, or function that uses compiler extensions (attributes, variadic macro features beyond standard C, inline assembly, etc.). Its definition must be examined.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph shows this as related to the assert machinery; its implementation or declaration may reveal use of extensions (inline assembly, non-standard attributes) or macros used to obtain context. Include it to inspect any indirect extension usage.\n\nThese symbols cover all types, macros and function declarations referenced (directly or via the assert call path) by UtBinFile2Mem that could mask or introduce compiler-specific language extensions. Checking their definitions/headers will allow a determination whether the target function uses any language extensions."
