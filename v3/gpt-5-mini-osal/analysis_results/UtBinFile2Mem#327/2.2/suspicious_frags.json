The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed as suspicious were reviewed and are not likely dead code candidates under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n- The fopen/fread/fclose calls and their surrounding control flow perform observable I/O and resource management; removing them would change program behaviour (file access, data read, resource release), so they are not dead code.\n- The use of the function parameters (Memory, Filename, Length) is active in those I/O calls; they are not unused and thus not dead.\n- The return of Success is used to communicate the operation result; assignments to it are relevant to the function outcome in at least some execution paths.\n- The macro expansion and UtAssert infrastructure were singled out where they may be no-ops in some builds or always-return constants; those are the plausible places where executed code could have no effect and therefore warrant investigation. Other lines in the function implement necessary, observable behavior and so do not need investigation for dead-code under Rule 2.2."
