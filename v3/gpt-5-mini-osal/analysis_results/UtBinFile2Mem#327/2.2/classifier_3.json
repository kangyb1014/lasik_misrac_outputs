Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtBinFile2Mem:\n```c\nbool UtBinFile2Mem(void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n    bool  Success;\n\n    Success = false;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        if (fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) == 1)\n        {\n            Success = true;\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        UtAssert_Failed(\"UtBinFile2Mem: Error Opening %s: %s\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtBinFile2Mem:\n#define UtAssert_Failed(__VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(false,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nSuccess = false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment 'Success = false;' provides the default return value for cases where fopen succeeds but fread fails, or where fopen fails but UtAssert_Failed returns control. Removing this assignment would change the function's behaviour (it could return an indeterminate value), so the operation is not dead code. (Only if UtAssert_Failed were guaranteed never to return and every path that reaches the return always assigns Success a value would the initial assignment be redundant; no evidence of that is provided.)"
