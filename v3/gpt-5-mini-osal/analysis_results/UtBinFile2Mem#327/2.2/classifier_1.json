Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtBinFile2Mem:\n```c\nbool UtBinFile2Mem(void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n    bool  Success;\n\n    Success = false;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        if (fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) == 1)\n        {\n            Success = true;\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        UtAssert_Failed(\"UtBinFile2Mem: Error Opening %s: %s\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtBinFile2Mem:\n#define UtAssert_Failed(__VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(false,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define UtAssert_Failed(__VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(false,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The macro UtAssert_Failed expands to a call to UtAssertEx(false, UtAssert_GetContext(), __FILE__, __LINE__, ...). Given the provided definition UtAssert_GetContext(void) { return DefaultContext; } this function is side\u2011effect free and always returns a compile\u2011time constant value. Therefore the call UtAssert_GetContext() is an executed operation whose removal (for example by inlining the constant DefaultContext into the macro) would not change program behaviour. That call is redundant dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If UtAssert_GetContext had side effects or returned non\u2011constant state, then no violation would occur.)"
