  "explanation": "The function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *), and the helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a const OS_object_token_t *; these do not need further investigation. The local pointer impl is used to modify the semaphore object (sem_init(&impl->id,...)), so it legitimately points to a non-const object. The sem_init call requires a mutable sem_t, so &impl->id is expected to be non-const. Therefore these fragments are not suspicious with respect to Rule 8.13."
