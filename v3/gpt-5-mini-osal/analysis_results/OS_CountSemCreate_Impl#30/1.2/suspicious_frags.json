  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The inline function (static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) uses standard C inline semantics, not a vendor-only extension.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its use with &(tok) is standard C pointer/address usage; in the call it expands to &(*token) which is valid C and not an extension.\n- Use of POSIX types/functions (sem_t, sem_init) are library/OS APIs, not compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as specified by your instruction.\n- Array indexing, typedefs, and the integer macros are all standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
