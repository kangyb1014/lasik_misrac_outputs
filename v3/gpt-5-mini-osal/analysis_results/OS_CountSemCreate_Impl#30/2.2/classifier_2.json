  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemCreate_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemCreate_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, uint32 sem_initial_value, uint32 options)\n{\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (sem_initial_value > SEM_VALUE_MAX)\n    {\n        return OS_INVALID_SEM_VALUE;\n    }\n\n    if (sem_init(&impl->id, 0, sem_initial_value) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CountSemCreate_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_MAX_COUNT_SEMAPHORES]\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    sem_t id;\n} OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n...\n#define OS_INVALID_SEM_VALUE (-20)\n...\n#define OS_SEM_FAILURE (-6)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (sem_init(&impl->id, 0, sem_initial_value) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The sem_init call and its error-check are not dead code: sem_init has side effects (initializes the semaphore object) and can fail (returns <0), so the conditional and return on failure affect program behaviour. Removing that call or the error-handling would change behaviour, therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
