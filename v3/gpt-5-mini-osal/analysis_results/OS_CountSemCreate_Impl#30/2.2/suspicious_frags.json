The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have flagged the macro and the three operations in the function that could be executed yet potentially redundant depending on platform/configuration and thus warrant investigation for dead code: the object-table lookup (macro usage), the SEM_VALUE_MAX bounds check, and the sem_init() call + error path. Other fragments are not reported because they are actively used and their removal would clearly affect behaviour: the struct field sem_t id is the target of sem_init, the function's final return value is required to communicate success, and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is used by the macro to index the object table. The token parameter and the table storage are therefore not dead. Additionally, simple typedefs and constant definitions shown in the supplementary code are declarations only and not executed operations, so they are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2."
