  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present in the provided function. All statements are potentially reachable depending on the return value of OS_ObjectIdGetById: the call itself always executes, the conditional body (calling OS_CondVarSignal_Impl) executes when return_code == OS_SUCCESS, and the final return executes on all paths. There are no statements after an unconditional return, no constant conditions that make branches impossible, and no dead-labels or unreachable blocks in this snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). Note: reachability conclusions are based solely on this snippet; if any of the called identifiers are macros that introduce non-local returns or remove code in preprocessing, that would be outside this fragment and should be checked elsewhere, but within this source fragment no unreachable code exists."
