  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are evident in the provided fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: typedefs, integer types, macros for constants, comments, local variable declarations, function calls and returns. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, Microsoft-specific __declspec, GCC labels-as-values, trailing commas in function prototypes, anonymous structs/unions as an extension, or other documented compiler extensions.\n\nTwo points checked but not flagged as extensions:\n- The call to OS_CondVarSignal_Impl(&token); could only be suspicious if the function lacks a visible prototype in the translation unit, which would rely on the obsolete implicit-function-declaration behavior (pre-C99). That behavior is a language-version issue and some compilers may permit it as an extension, but the snippet does not show the presence or absence of a prototype, so this cannot be concluded from the provided code and therefore is not reported as an extension use.\n- The typedef of struct OS_object_token (forward declaration) is standard C. Whether the variable OS_object_token_t token; is valid depends on whether the complete struct definition is available in the translation unit; that is a completeness/definition issue, not a compiler-extension usage.\n\nGiven the information provided, there are no fragments that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions, so nothing is reported for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
