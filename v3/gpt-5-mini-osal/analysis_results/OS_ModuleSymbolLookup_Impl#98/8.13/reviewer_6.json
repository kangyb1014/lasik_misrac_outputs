Therefore it could and should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl;') to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. As written it is a non-const pointer to a non-const type even though no modification is performed, so the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef uintptr_t cpuaddr\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl the local pointer 'impl' is only used to read the module record (impl->dl_handle) and is not used to modify the record, so it can and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl) to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (an address of a non-const global) to a pointer-to-const is allowed, and using impl->dl_handle after making impl point to a const-qualified struct is fine (the expression becomes a top-level-const pointer value which can be passed to the existing void * parameter without changing the pointed-to type). Therefore the code as written violates the recommendation in Rule 8.13."
