In the shown use (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token);) the function only reads from the table (uses impl->dl_handle) and the token passed in is const; therefore the pointer could/should be const-qualified (const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl). The macro forces a non-const result and thus leads to a pointer that is not const-qualified when it could be, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef uintptr_t cpuaddr\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct that the local pointer 'impl' can be const-qualified and therefore the current code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. In OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl the code only reads from the table (uses impl->dl_handle) so declaring impl as const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl would be appropriate and would satisfy the rule.\n\nThe agent's extra claim that the macro \"forces a non-const result\" is misleading: the macro yields the address of a non-const array element (&tbl[index]), but assigning the address of a non-const object to a pointer-to-const is allowed in C. The macro does not prevent declaring the local pointer as a pointer-to-const. (Care must be taken with how the member is used when qualified \u2014 e.g. impl->dl_handle becomes a const-qualified lvalue at the top level, but passing that value to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl is allowed without a cast because the top-level const on the pointer itself does not impede passing the value to a parameter of type void *.)\n\nSo the reported violation (that the pointer should be const-qualified) is correct, though the justification about the macro \"forcing\" a non-const pointer is not accurate."
