  "explanation": "The selected fragments are places where pointer const-qualification might be missing or propagated: the local pointer to the module record (impl), its retrieval via the object-table macro, the use of impl->dl_handle when calling the generic lookup, the definition of the module-record member dl_handle, the macro that indexes the table, the generic lookup function parameter dl_handle and its use of dlsym, and the external module table declaration. These all warrant investigation to determine whether the pointers could (or should) be to const-qualified types.\n\nOther code fragments do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the token parameter in OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl is already a pointer to const; SymbolName is const char *; SymbolAddress is an output parameter and therefore must be a non-const pointer so it can be written; dlError is already const char *; status and other non-pointer variables are irrelevant to pointer const-qualification. Also, dlsym has the POSIX prototype taking/returning void*; changing some of those pointers to point-to-const may be incompatible with that API (this compatibility concern is why the dl-related pointers were included for inspection rather than automatically marked as violations)."
