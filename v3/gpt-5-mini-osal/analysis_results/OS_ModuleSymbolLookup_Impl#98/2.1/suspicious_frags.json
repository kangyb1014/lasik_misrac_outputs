  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided snippets. Reasoning by fragment:\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: The function consists of an index lookup via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, a call to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, and a return of its status. All statements execute sequentially and are reachable when the function is called.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro / OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: The macro expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]. In the call site OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token) this becomes &OS_impl_module_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)], which is reachable and well-formed for an lvalue *token. There is no dead branch or code that cannot be reached due to the macro expansion itself.\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: The initial assignment status = OS_ERROR; the calls to dlerror() and dlsym(), and the subsequent conditional (if (dlError != NULL) / else if (Function == NULL) / else) are all potentially reachable depending on dlerror/dlsym results. The final assignment *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function; and the return status are executed in all cases, so no unreachable tail code exists. The three conditional branches are alternate runtime outcomes rather than unreachable code.\n\n- Struct and typedef declarations: The struct member dl_handle being annotated as potentially unused or the typedefs do not introduce unreachable code.\n\nNotes: There are runtime-safety concerns that are not violations of MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) \u2014 for example, passing an invalid or out-of-range token leading to an out-of-bounds array access, or a NULL token pointer \u2014 but these are runtime/validation issues rather than statically unreachable code. Accordingly, no fragments were flagged for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
