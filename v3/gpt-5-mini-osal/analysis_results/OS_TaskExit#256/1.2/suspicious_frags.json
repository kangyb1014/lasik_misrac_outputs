  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: type declarations (osal_id_t, OS_object_token_t are user-defined types but not compiler extensions), local variables, assignment, an if statement, function calls, and comments. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_..., typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), trailing commas in function parameter lists, or other vendor-specific syntax. The comment /* Impl function never returns */ is not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
