  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined OS_TaskExit and the related implementation fragments provided (OS_TaskExit_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, OS_TaskGetId_Impl and supporting macros). I found no code that is statically unreachable (i.e., no statements or branches that can never be executed):\n\n- OS_TaskExit: The only call at the end is OS_TaskExit_Impl(), whose implementation calls pthread_exit(NULL). pthread_exit is a documented non-returning thread termination call, but there is no code in OS_TaskExit after this call, so there is no unreachable code in this function (only a comment stating the impl never returns).\n\n- OS_TaskExit_Impl / pthread_exit: The impl contains only pthread_exit(NULL); there is no subsequent code in that function that would be unreachable.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: The function returns early on error conditions and otherwise continues to call OS_ObjectIdConvertToken; all branches are reachable depending on return values. There are no dead branches or statements guaranteed never to execute.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit: The various early-return checks (global state, shutdown lock_mode, max objects) are conditional and reachable depending on runtime state; they are legitimate precondition checks, not unreachable code.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex: Parameter checks and the id-type check lead to different return codes; each branch is reachable depending on inputs (e.g., caller may pass mismatched idtype).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken: The function uses a while(true) retry loop that can break via several distinct break/return points. The post-loop handling (unlocking, refcount update, restoring active_id on failure) is reachable depending on token->lock_mode and return_code. There is no statement that cannot be reached given appropriate runtime conditions.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel and OS_TaskGetId_Impl: Both contain straightforward statements that are reachable in the contexts where they are called (unlock only if locked; return the thread-specific id respectively).\n\nGiven the provided code, there are no clearly unreachable statements or branches to flag for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1. If additional files exist outside the provided fragments (e.g., other callers with code after a non-returning call, alternative implementations of OS_TaskExit_Impl that return, or code generated/compiled conditionally), those should be reviewed, but based on the supplied source there are no unreachable-code fragments to investigate."
