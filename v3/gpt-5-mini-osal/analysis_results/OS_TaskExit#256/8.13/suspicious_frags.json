  "explanation": "All other fragments in OS_TaskExit do not involve taking the address of an object or passing a pointer to a function, so Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible) is not relevant for them. Specifically:\n- The declarations (osal_id_t task_id; OS_object_token_t token;) are non-pointer objects and do not by themselves imply missing const-qualification of pointer targets.\n- The call task_id = OS_TaskGetId_Impl(); uses a return value, not a pointer parameter.\n- The call OS_TaskExit_Impl(); takes no pointer in this snippet.\n- Comments and control flow (the if/else structure excluding the shown call line) contain no pointer usages.\n\nThe only places in this function where a pointer to token is passed (and thus potentially should be const-qualified if the callee does not modify the object) are the three call sites listed above; they are reported for further investigation. Other code fragments do not require investigation under Rule 8.13 based on the provided source."
