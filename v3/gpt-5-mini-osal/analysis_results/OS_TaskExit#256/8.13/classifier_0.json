  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: token is a mutable local object filled by OS_ObjectIdGetById and then passed to OS_TaskDetach_Impl(&token); it is reasonable for the callee to modify the token (and subsequent calls also pass &token). Therefore a non-const pointer is appropriate. (A violation would occur if OS_TaskDetach_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer but in fact does not modify the object \u2014 in that case the parameter should be const OS_object_token_t * to satisfy Rule 8.13.)"
