  "explanation": "I inspected the function body and the related type definitions provided. There are no explicit calls to memcmp or other string-comparison library functions in the function (only sem_getvalue, a simple assignment to count_prop->value, and returns). The implementation record typedef (sem_t id) and the semaphore table declaration contain no string operations. Therefore those parts do not need investigation for Rule 21.14. The only fragments included above should be examined further (their definitions/usages outside the provided snippet may hide string comparisons). No other fragments in the supplied code use memcmp or compare null-terminated strings."
