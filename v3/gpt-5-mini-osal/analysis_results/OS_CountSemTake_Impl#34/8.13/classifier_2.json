  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer 'impl' refers to a record whose member 'id' is passed to sem_wait(&impl->id). sem_wait modifies the semaphore (expects sem_t *), so the pointed-to object must be modifiable; declaring impl as pointer-to-const would prevent taking a non-const address of impl->id. Also the table OS_impl_count_sem_table is a non-const array. Therefore it is not possible (or correct) to make impl point to a const-qualified type here, so Rule 8.13 is not violated."
