  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not appear to be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible):\n- The function parameter is already declared as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token), so that usage complies with the rule.\n- The return statements and integer return values are not pointer types and thus are not relevant to this rule.\n- The only pointer-bearing objects in the function are the local pointer 'impl', the result of the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, and the access to impl->id (address passed to sem_wait). Those are listed above for investigation because they determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified. Other code in the function does not contain additional pointer targets that would fall under Rule 8.13."
