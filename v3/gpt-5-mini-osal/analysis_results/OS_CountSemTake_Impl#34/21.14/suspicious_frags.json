  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related inline helper. There is no direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp anywhere in the shown code (the function only calls sem_wait and returns constants). The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns a numeric field (token->obj_idx) and contains no string operations. The only place that could conceivably hide a memcmp invocation is the macro call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, whose definition was not provided; that macro could expand to code that performs comparisons (potentially using memcmp on null-terminated strings). Therefore the macro invocation line is flagged for investigation. All other lines in the provided code do not involve string comparisons or calls to memcmp and do not need further investigation for Rule 21.14 based on the supplied code."
