First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. The provided target function and the related definitions contain no for statements or macros/inline functions that expand to or contain a for loop. Specifically:\n- OS_CountSemTake_Impl contains only an assignment, an if checking sem_wait result, and returns; no for is present.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an array index expression and does not include any for loop constructs.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a simple accessor returning token->obj_idx; it has no for loop.\n- The OS_impl_count_sem_table declaration and the struct typedefs contain no for loops.\n- The call to sem_wait is a library function call; while its implementation might contain loops internally, MISRA Rule 14.2 applies to for statements in the source under review, and there are none in the supplied code.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied sources that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
