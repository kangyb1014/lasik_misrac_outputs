  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I examined the provided code and additional definitions; there is no use of memcmp anywhere. The fragments present and why they do not require investigation:\n\n- The call to clock_gettime (Status = clock_gettime(...)): This is a time-retrieval API, not a string comparison.\n- Assignment via OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds and the OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds definition: This function performs integer arithmetic to build an OS_time_t (multiplication and division), with no string operations or comparisons.\n- The OS_DEBUG invocation that passes strerror(errno): strerror returns a pointer to an error string but the code only passes it to a debug macro (which is defined as empty here). There is no comparison of strings, and no memcmp usage.\n- Error handling and ReturnCode assignments: these are control-flow and integer assignments, not string comparisons.\n\nNo other functions or macros in the provided snippets perform string comparison operations, so there are no code fragments that match Rule 21.14 (using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). Therefore I report no suspicious fragments."
