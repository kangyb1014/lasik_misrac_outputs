  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. The only conditional in the function is:\n\nif (Status == 0)\n\nwhich is not invariant because Status is assigned immediately above from the call to clock_gettime (Status = clock_gettime(...)); its value depends on the runtime result of that call, so the controlling expression is not a compile-time or constant invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) in the function, so none of the loop-related exceptions or violations of Rule 14.3 apply. The macro OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK (expanding to CLOCK_REALTIME) is used as a runtime argument to clock_gettime, not as a controlling expression. Therefore no code fragments in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
