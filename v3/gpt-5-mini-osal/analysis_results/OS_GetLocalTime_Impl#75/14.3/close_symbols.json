  "explanation": "- clock_gettime: The controlling expression compares Status to 0 where Status is assigned from clock_gettime. To determine whether the expression Status == 0 can be invariant you must know the declared/defined behavior of clock_gettime (return values, whether it can fail/return non-zero, whether it is a real library call or a compile-time constant/macro). If clock_gettime is implemented as or replaced by a function/macro that always returns the same value, the condition would be invariant.\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK: This argument to clock_gettime is a macro/constant that may change which clock source is used. Its value or macro expansion could affect whether clock_gettime can legally return differing values (or whether the call is compiled away/redirected). The analysis must see its definition.\n- struct timespec (definition): Although not directly in the controlling expression, the declaration of struct timespec ensures that the call to clock_gettime is the expected function (matching prototype) and helps confirm that Status is indeed assigned from a runtime function call rather than from some compile-time constant or malformed macro expansion.\n- any test/link-time stub or wrapper that can replace/override clock_gettime: In this codebase or in unit tests, clock_gettime might be replaced by a project-specific wrapper or test stub that always returns a fixed value. Those overrides must be examined because they determine whether Status is invariant in the compiled/linked binary.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds, OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR, strerror, errno, or ReturnCode are not needed to judge whether the controlling expression Status == 0 is invariant.)"
