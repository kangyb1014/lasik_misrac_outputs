  "explanation": "- clock_gettime: needed to know its possible return values and failure modes (0 on success, -1 on error) so the two branches (Status==0 vs else) can be judged reachable. Also needed to check if an implementation/override always returns one value.  \n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK: the clock id passed to clock_gettime; if this macro expands to an invalid/constant value that makes clock_gettime always fail or always succeed, one branch could be provably unreachable.  \n- struct timespec (from <time.h>): required to understand how TimeSp is populated and whether accessing tv_sec/tv_nsec is well-formed (not relevant for control flow but part of the call that could have side-effects in macros/overrides).  \n- OS_time_t (type): to confirm that assignment via OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds is valid and whether that call or assignment might be a macro with control-flow implications (e.g., noreturn, longjmp).  \n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: must inspect its implementation or attributes (e.g., if it is annotated noreturn, or contains side-effects that change control flow) to determine if code after it is unreachable.  \n- OS_DEBUG: often a macro; its definition could contain control-flow (return, exit, longjmp) that would make subsequent statements in the else branch unreachable, so its body must be known.  \n- strerror: its behaviour is required to ensure it does not change control flow (normally it doesn't, but a custom replacement could).  \n- errno: to confirm how error reporting is performed and whether errno usage could affect control flow or indicate that clock_gettime can fail.  \n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: their definitions/values are required to see if they are macros/functions with side effects or special attributes that could affect reachability or subsequent code analysis."
