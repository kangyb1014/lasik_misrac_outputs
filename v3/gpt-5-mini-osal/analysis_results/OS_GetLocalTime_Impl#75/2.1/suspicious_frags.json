  "explanation": "Other parts of the function and supplied definitions do not present obvious unreachable-code issues and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1: the local variable declarations (Status, ReturnCode, TimeSp) and the function prologue are ordinary; the call statement Status = clock_gettime(OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, &TimeSp); is the runtime decision point for the if/else and is therefore not itself unreachable; the ReturnCode assignments are within the branches already listed; the final return ReturnCode; is reachable because both branches assign ReturnCode; the OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds implementation contains only straight-line arithmetic (no conditionals or returns that could make code unreachable) and the simple macros OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR are constants. The listed fragments are reported because they can interact with preprocessor macros (for example OS_DEBUG being empty) or platform-specific behavior (clock_gettime and errno/strerror) in ways that may cause code to be effectively removed or never executed; those interactions warrant targeted inspection for possible unreachable code."
