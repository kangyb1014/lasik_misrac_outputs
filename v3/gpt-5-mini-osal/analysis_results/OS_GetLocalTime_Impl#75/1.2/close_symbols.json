  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about language extensions you must inspect any symbols whose definitions or macro expansions could introduce compiler-specific constructs (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions, builtins, nested functions, nonstandard integer types, or other compiler-specific syntax). Each listed symbol is required for that purpose:\n\n- OS_time_t: its typedef/struct definition may use compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-field widths, anonymous structs/unions, or nonstandard integer types). You need the exact definition to detect such extensions.\n- int32: this typedef may be an alias for a compiler-provided extended type or defined using compiler intrinsics (e.g. __int32, __attribute__ or typedefs relying on nonstandard headers). Inspect the definition to ensure no extension is used.\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: function prototype/definition may use GCC/Clang extensions (attribute annotations, inline/asmlinkage, nonstandard calling conventions, or return types defined with extensions). You must view its declaration/definition to check for extensions and confirm the return type matches OS_time_t without extension usage.\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK: macro could expand to a compiler-specific constant or expression (e.g. use of typeof, statement-expr, __COUNTER__, __extension__, or other nonstandard tokens). Inspect the macro expansion.\n- clock_gettime (declaration): provided by platform headers; its declaration could use attributes or nonstandard prototypes on some toolchains. Also the function is POSIX (not ISO C) \u2014 you must confirm whether the usage is permitted in the project's MISRA context or if any compiler-specific extension appears in the declaration.\n- struct timespec (and members tv_sec, tv_nsec): the struct or member types could be defined using nonstandard types or attributes. You must check the exact definition to ensure no extensions are used.\n- time_t (underlying type): the underlying definition may be an implementation-specific type or use extensions \u2014 verify it is a standard type and is not declared with compiler-specific syntax.\n- OS_DEBUG: macro expansion may contain varargs, statement-expressions, GCC attributes, or other extension constructs. Inspect expansion to ensure it uses only standard C features.\n- strerror: its declaration is from the C library; verify its prototype does not rely on compiler-specific extensions in the target build environment.\n- errno: macro/identifier may be implemented as a macro that expands to an expression (e.g. __errno_location()) that could use compiler-specific builtins; check its definition for extensions.\n- OS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR: these macros or enum values might be defined using nonstandard constructs or odd declarations; inspect to ensure they are normal integer constants.\n\nCollecting the above symbol definitions and macro expansions is sufficient to detect if any compiler-specific language extensions are being used in or by OS_GetLocalTime_Impl."
