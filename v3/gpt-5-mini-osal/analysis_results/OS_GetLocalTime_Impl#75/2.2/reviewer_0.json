  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. The OS_CHECK_POINTER(time_struct) invocation appears in the wrapper function OS_GetLocalTime (shown in the additional code), not inside OS_GetLocalTime_Impl (the target code). MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code, and if OS_CHECK_POINTER expands to a no-op (e.g. ((void)0) or empty) then the statement in OS_GetLocalTime would be an executed no-op whose removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 that would be dead code and could violate R2.2 for the project/build. However, the specific claim that OS_GetLocalTime_Impl violates R2.2 is incorrect because that function does not contain the OS_CHECK_POINTER invocation. If the intent was to report OS_GetLocalTime (the wrapper), that report could be valid for a build where the macro is a no-op; but as written the report misidentifies the function and is therefore false."
