  "explanation": "All other code fragments either do not involve pointer types or involve values passed by value (e.g. TimeSp.tv_sec, TimeSp.tv_nsec) or local scalar/struct declarations and simple integer assignments/returns. These do not present opportunities for converting a pointer to a const-qualified type and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. The listed fragments are the only occurrences in the function that involve pointer usage or pointer-returning library calls and thus should be inspected for appropriate const-qualification."
