  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale:\n\n- The only do-while in the function is: do { ... } while (0); This is an integer constant expression that evaluates to false and is the documented exception in the rule (a do-while with essentially Boolean controlling expression evaluating to false is permitted), so it should not be flagged.\n\n- The for loop (for (idx = 0; idx < OS_MAX_TIMEBASES; ++idx)) has a non\u2011invariant controlling expression because idx is modified each iteration; the bound OS_MAX_TIMEBASES is a constant but the comparison depends on the changing loop variable, so it is not invariant.\n\n- There are no while loops or other controlling expressions that are constant/invariant (e.g., while(1) or similar) or any other loop constructs with a controlling expression that does not change.\n\nTherefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
