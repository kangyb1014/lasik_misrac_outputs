  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry constitutes dead code (i.e., can be removed without changing program behaviour) you must know both its reachability and whether its executed operations have observable effects. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl: The concrete implementation of OS_Unlock_Global. Needed to determine whether unlocking the global actually has side effects (affects shared state, scheduling, timing) so removing the unlock would change behaviour.\n\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl: The concrete implementation of OS_Lock_Global. Needed to determine whether re-locking has observable effects (restores protection, influences concurrency/timing) so removing the lock would change behaviour.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFromToken: Implementation of the conversion from the iterator token to an osal_id_t. Needed to know if this conversion has side effects (e.g., validation, state updates) or is a pure computation; this affects whether the func call would be equivalent if removed.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t: Definition of the iterator struct (fields token and arg). Needed to know what iter->token and iter->arg contain (types, lifetime, whether accessing them is observable) and whether reading them has side effects.\n\n- osal_id_t: Type definition and any semantics for object IDs. Needed to assess whether passing the id to func produces observable behaviour distinct from other alternatives (and to reason about conversion/validation effects).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: The initializer for the iterator. Needed to know how iter->token/arg are populated and whether OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry is ever supplied/registered; this affects reachability and whether removing the function would alter iterator behaviour.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: The iterator driver that calls the process entry callback. Required to determine how (and if) OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry is invoked in normal flows, what callbacks/args are passed, and therefore whether the function is actually reachable/executed.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Iterator cleanup; needed to understand iterator lifecycle and whether the process entry is essential for correct resource handling (e.g., whether the callback is part of cleanup semantics).\n\n- OS_CloseFileByName: One explicit caller. Its implementation is needed to see how it uses the iterator and func (what callback/arg it registers) and therefore whether removal of the process-entry step would change observable behaviour when closing files.\n\n- OS_CloseAllFiles: Another caller. Same reason: to inspect its use of the iterator and the callback it supplies, to determine reachability and observable effects.\n\n- OS_ForEachObjectOfType: Another caller. Needed to see how the iterator/callback are used for generic per-object processing and whether removing the process entry would alter behaviour of per-object callbacks.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: Appears in the caller call chains as a generic handler executor used in tests/harness code. Include to inspect what concrete callback implementations are actually invoked through the iterator in test and runtime paths (to determine real side effects).\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry is ever invoked (reachability via callers and the iterator driver), and (2) whether its internal operations (unlock/convert/call/relock) produce observable side effects (global lock timing/concurrency, id conversion side effects, callback effects). Without their implementations/type definitions you cannot conclude that the operations are removable without changing program behaviour, as required by the MISRA dead-code rule analysis."
