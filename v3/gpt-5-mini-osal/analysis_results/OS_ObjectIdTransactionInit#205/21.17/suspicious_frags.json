  "explanation": "All other lines in the function do not call or pass pointers to the string.h family of functions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The conditional checks of OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState, the OS_GetMaxForObjectType(idtype) call, the simple assignments to token->lock_mode, token->obj_type, and token->obj_idx, and the various return statements do not invoke standard string handling functions nor perform raw memory/string operations and thus do not need investigation under this rule. The two fragments reported are the only places in this function that directly invoke a string.h routine (memset) or pass the token pointer to another routine (OS_Lock_Global) that could perform string.h operations and therefore should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
