  "explanation": "- uint8: definition/typedef is required to know the exact underlying type of Byte_ptr (e.g. unsigned char vs some unusual typedef). This confirms that indexing Byte_ptr[i] operates on the pointed-to object and does not implicitly modify the pointer parameter.\n- uint32: definition/typedef is required to know the exact type of parameter Length (e.g. unsigned int vs another type) so we can verify Length itself is not being modified and that loop control does not implicitly change the parameter.\n- bool: definition/typedef (or macro) is required to ensure the return type and use of true/false are the expected boolean type and not some macro that could hide side effects or parameter modification.\n- true / false: definitions (macros or enum constants) are needed to confirm their semantics have no side effects (e.g. are not defined as expressions that could modify function parameters).\n\nRationale: the MISRA rule under check concerns modification of function parameters. Verifying the typedefs/macros above ensures none of these names are defined in a way that would cause the code to actually modify the parameter variables (for example via surprising macro expansions or nonstandard typedefs)."
