  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are used only for reading: Length is not assigned to or modified, and Memory (a pointer parameter) is not modified. A local pointer (const uint8 *Byte_ptr) is initialized from Memory and is used to access the referenced objects; modifying this local pointer would not violate Rule 17.8 because the rule prohibits modifying the parameter itself, not a local copy. The code also does not attempt to write through the pointer (Byte_ptr[i] is only compared), and there are no assignments to Memory or Length. Therefore there are no apparent violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
