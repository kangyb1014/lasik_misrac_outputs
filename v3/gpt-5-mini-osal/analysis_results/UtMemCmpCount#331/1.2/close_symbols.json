  "explanation": "bool \u2014 must know how `bool` is defined in the build (is it the standard C99/_Bool from <stdbool.h>, a compiler intrinsic, or a project typedef/macro). Determining that decides whether a language extension is used.\n\nuint32 \u2014 the typedef/declaration of `uint32` must be inspected to see whether it is a standard typedef (e.g. an alias of `uint32_t`) or a compiler/project-specific extension (e.g. nonstandard width type or compiler-provided name).\n\nuint8 \u2014 same reason as `uint32`: need the typedef/declaration to determine if it is a standard type (alias to `uint8_t`/`unsigned char`) or a nonstandard/compiler-specific extension.\n\nstdbool.h \u2014 presence/usage of this header in the compilation unit or project indicates use of the standard C Boolean type; absence may indicate `bool` is a nonstandard symbol.\n\nstdint.h \u2014 presence/usage of this header supports that fixed-width integer types come from the standard; absence suggests `uint32`/`uint8` may be nonstandard/project/compiler extensions.\n\n__STDC_VERSION__ \u2014 the predefined macro (or equivalent compiler mode indicator) is required to determine which C standard the compiler targets (C89/C99/C11/etc.); this affects whether constructs like `_Bool`/`stdbool.h` and `<stdint.h>` are standard or whether their use/resolution relies on extensions."
