  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific checks performed: \n- No compiler-specific keywords or identifiers (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, __thread, __declspec, __inline__ (as an extension), nested functions, statement expressions ({ ...; }) or other known vendor extensions).\n- No use of GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific pragmas or #pragma directives.\n- No inline assembly, no non-standard linkage specifications, no anonymous/unnamed bit-fields or flexible array members used as extensions.\n- The integer and byte types (uint32, uint8) are typedefs to standard fixed-width types (uint32_t, uint8_t) as stated in the additional code \u2014 these are not compiler extensions.\n- The use of bool is standard C (either _Bool or bool from <stdbool.h>), not a compiler extension in the fragment shown.\n- The implicit conversion from const void* to const uint8* on initialization is valid in ISO C and is not a vendor extension.\n- All operators and expressions (array indexing, bitwise &, comparison) are standard C constructs.\n\nGiven the absence of any constructs explicitly documented as compiler-specific extensions, there are no code fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
