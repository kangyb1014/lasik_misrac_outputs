  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the function is invariant. The for-loop controlling expression (i < Length) depends on the loop variable i, which is modified by i++ each iteration, so it is not invariant. The if controlling expression (Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF)) depends on i and the memory contents at Byte_ptr[i], so it is not invariant. There are no do-while or intentionally infinite loops using invariant expressions, nor any other loop or conditional with a constant/invariant controlling expression. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
