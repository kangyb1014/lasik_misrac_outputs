  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Every statement can be executed depending on input: the for-loop body executes when Length > 0 (so the if and its return false are reachable when a mismatch occurs); if Length == 0 or no mismatches occur the loop terminates and the final return true is reached. There are no constant conditions, no code following an unconditional return within the same block, and no syntactic constructs that are inherently dead. Therefore no parts of this function need to be investigated for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
