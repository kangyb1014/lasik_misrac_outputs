  "explanation": "- memcmp: the MISRA rule explicitly forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Even though the target function does not call memcmp directly, the analysis must confirm that this function does not delegate to or get replaced by a memcmp wrapper elsewhere.\n- strlen: to determine whether callers pass a length derived from string operations (e.g. strlen or strlen+1). If callers compute Length with strlen (or similar) and then call this routine, the routine is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- bool, uint32, uint8: the typedefs/types used in the signature and body are required to fully understand parameter/return semantics (e.g. whether Length is an unsigned byte count or has other semantic wrappers). They identify the exact types involved when checking for string-vs-binary usage.\n- prototype/declaration of UtMemCmpCount: the header declaration may reveal comments, annotations or macros (e.g. attributes, wrappers, or alternate implementations) that affect whether this is intended/used as a string comparator or a thin wrapper over memcmp.\n- all caller functions of UtMemCmpCount (their prototypes and call sites): to decide whether this function is being used to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect every place it is called. Call sites show what is passed for Memory and Length (e.g. string pointers and strlen-derived lengths or pointers to buffers and explicit byte counts). Knowing the callers is essential to determine an actual MISRA violation (use of memcmp-like comparison on null-terminated strings) rather than just inspecting the isolated implementation."
