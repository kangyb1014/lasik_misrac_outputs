  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function UtMemCmpCount treats the input as a raw memory buffer (Memory cast to const uint8*) and performs an explicit byte-by-byte comparison against a numeric pattern (Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF)) inside a loop that is bounded by the Length parameter. There are no string-library calls (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, strlen, etc.), no checks for or use of the null terminator ('\\0'), and no operations that compare two null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments that would trigger investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
