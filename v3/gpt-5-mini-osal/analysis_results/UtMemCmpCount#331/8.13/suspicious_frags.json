  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter is declared as const void *Memory (const-qualified), and the local pointer is declared as const uint8 *Byte_ptr and is initialized from Memory. There are no other pointer variables or pointer assignments in the code that point to non-const-qualified types, nor are there casts removing const qualification. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 8.13."
