  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. UtMemCmpCount contains no function calls (no direct calls, no function pointers, no macros invoking functions), so it cannot call itself directly or indirectly. Therefore, no other functions or call-graph edges need to be provided to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
