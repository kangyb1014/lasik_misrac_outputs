  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function qualifies as dead code. Each operation can affect program behaviour depending on inputs: the assignment of Byte_ptr is required for subsequent memory accesses; the for-loop and its comparison (Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF)) determine the returned boolean and cannot be removed without changing results; the early return false on mismatch and the final return true are both reachable depending on Memory/Length and thus affect behaviour. The loop body may be skipped when Length is zero, but skipped/conditionally executed code is not dead code (it is reachable depending on runtime data). The additional line 'const void *Memory' is merely a symbol/type mention, not executable code. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for MISRA C Rule 2.2 in the supplied code."
