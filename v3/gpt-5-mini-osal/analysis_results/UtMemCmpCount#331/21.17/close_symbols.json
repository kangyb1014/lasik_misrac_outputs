This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is needed\n\n1) uint8\n   - UtMemCmpCount casts the void *Memory to const uint8 * and indexes Byte_ptr[i]. To decide whether indexing accesses beyond object bounds you must know the definition/width of uint8 (typically unsigned char). The element size determines the mapping from index to byte offset; if uint8 were not a one\u2011byte type the bounds reasoning would change.\n\n2) uint32\n   - The loop index and Length are uint32. You need the typedef/width of uint32 to reason about wraparound, range and comparison behavior (e.g. if Length can exceed addressable memory or if increments could overflow). This affects whether the loop can attempt out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses for large Length values.\n\n3) bool\n   - The return type is bool. Knowing its definition (e.g. stdbool.h/_Bool) is required only to fully model the function signature for callers and analysis tooling, and to ensure no hidden side effects from a nonstandard bool.\n\n4) Memory buffer size / allocation contract\n   - To determine whether Byte_ptr[i] can access beyond the referenced object you must know the actual number of allocated/valid bytes the pointer Memory refers to (or the calling precondition that Memory points to at least Length bytes). Without this symbol/contract you cannot conclude if the indexing is in\u2011bounds, which is the central question for a MISRA string.h bounds violation analysis.\n\n5) Length (semantics and provenance)\n   - You must know where Length comes from and what it represents (number of bytes to check). If Length can be greater than the actual buffer size or is under/unchecked by callers, the function may perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. Analysis needs the symbol/definition showing how Length is produced or validated before calling UtMemCmpCount.\n\n6) Project-level macro/aliasing of standard <string.h> functions\n   - The MISRA rule targets use of the standard <string.h> functions. Although UtMemCmpCount does not call those functions directly, project headers could define macros or aliases that change semantics (or rename/redirect calls). To be certain this function does not implicitly invoke or get replaced by a string.h routine (or that similar code elsewhere does), the analyzer needs visibility of any macro definitions/aliases for memcmp/memcpy/memset/\u2026 in the compilation unit or project headers.\n\nSummary: The function itself contains no calls to standard string.h functions, so there is no direct string.h violation. However, to determine whether it can perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses (which is the underlying safety concern of the MISRA rule), the analyzer must know the precise typedefs for uint8/uint32/bool, the actual buffer size or caller preconditions for Memory and Length, and whether any project macros/aliases affect standard functions. These symbols let the next agent decide definitively whether indexing Byte_ptr[i] can go beyond the referenced object."
