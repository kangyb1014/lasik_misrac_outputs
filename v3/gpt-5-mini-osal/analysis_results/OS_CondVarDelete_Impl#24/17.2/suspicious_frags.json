  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. OS_CondVarDelete_Impl does not call itself directly and contains only: (1) two calls to well-known POSIX library functions (pthread_cond_destroy and pthread_mutex_destroy) which are not application callbacks and do not call back into user-defined OS functions, and (2) a macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET that (per the provided additional code) resolves to direct table access/inline index extraction (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returns token->obj_idx) and does not invoke functions that could recurse. The OS_impl_condvar_table is an array of plain records (no function pointers), and the struct contains only pthread types. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other function calls in this fragment that could introduce indirect recursion back to OS_CondVarDelete_Impl, so no code fragments require further investigation for Rule 17.2."
