  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected in the provided function. The function performs only sequential operations: it initializes local variables, obtains a pointer to the implementation record via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, calls pthread_cond_destroy, conditionally updates final_status, calls pthread_mutex_destroy, conditionally updates final_status again, and then returns final_status. There are no return statements, goto statements, infinite loops, switch/case constructs with fall-through, or conditionals that would make later statements impossible to reach. The macro expansion OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token) yields a runtime array access using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token)) and does not introduce compile-time-eliminated code paths. Therefore there are no code fragments that are statically unreachable per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. (Note: potential runtime issues such as dereferencing a NULL token or error handling semantics are outside the scope of the unreachable-code rule.)"
