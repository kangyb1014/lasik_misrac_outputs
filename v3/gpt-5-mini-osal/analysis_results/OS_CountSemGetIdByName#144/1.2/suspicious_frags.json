  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The function and supporting snippets use standard C constructs (function definition, pointer parameters, return statements, typedef aliases for integer types, and macro invocations). The shown macro definition for OS_CHECK_POINTER expands to another macro call and does not contain compiler-specific keywords or extension constructs. The other macros used (ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, BUGCHECK) are invoked as ordinary macros; invocation of a macro does not by itself imply a language extension, and no definitions provided contain extension tokens. No GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific tokens were present (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous structs/unions, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the supplied code."
