  "explanation": "OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The function simply returns this symbol. To be certain the return expression does not expand (via a macro) into any control/selection/iteration constructs (which could create an invariant controlling expression elsewhere), the analyzer must know the exact definition/expansion of this symbol.\n\nint32: The function return type. Knowing the typedef ensures the analyzer understands whether any unusual macro/type trickery is in play that could affect control-flow interpretation (for completeness when reasoning about the function body).\n\nsize_t: A parameter type (SizeLimit) that is unused in the body. Including its typedef is useful to confirm there are no hidden macro/attribute expansions on the parameter declaration that introduce control constructs. \n\nNote: The target function contains no selection/iteration statements (if/for/while/do/switch). Under MISRA's \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\", only controlling expressions in those constructs are relevant. Given the body is a single return of a (presumably) constant symbol, the main risk would be if OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED expanded to code containing control statements; hence the need to inspect its definition. The other symbols are included for completeness to rule out hidden macro/type expansions."
