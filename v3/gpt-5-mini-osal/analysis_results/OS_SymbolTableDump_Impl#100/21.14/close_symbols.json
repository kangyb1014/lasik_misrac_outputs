  "explanation": "1) OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED \u2014 The function returns this symbol. It may be a macro or expression; to rule out a MISRA memcmp violation you must inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand to or call memcmp (or any wrapper that uses memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings).\n\n2) memcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule specifically forbids using the standard memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. Even though the target function has no explicit callees, you must check whether memcmp is referenced directly in the function body (or via macros/aliases that expand to it). Inspecting the memcmp symbol (and any macro aliases that map to it) is required to determine if the rule is violated."
