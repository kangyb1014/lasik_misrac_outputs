  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), performs no buffer or pointer arithmetic, and does not manipulate memory buffers \u2014 it only returns the constant OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. The provided macro definition (#define OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (-28)) is a simple constant and does not involve string operations. Although the function has a const char *filename parameter, it is unused in this implementation, so there is no risk of out\u2011of\u2011bounds string access here. Therefore there are no code fragments needing investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
