  "explanation": "The implementation contains no calls to any string.h functions and has no callees (static call graph shows an empty callee list). The function simply returns OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and does not touch its parameters, so there are no direct uses of memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc. The only symbol to verify is OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: confirm it is a compile-time constant (enum or macro numeric constant) and not a macro or function that expands to or calls any string.h routines. If OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED is a plain constant, no other symbols are required to conclude there is no violation of the string.h bounds rule."
