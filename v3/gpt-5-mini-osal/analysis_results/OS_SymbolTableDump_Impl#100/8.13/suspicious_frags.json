  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found in the provided code that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n\n- OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl's parameter is declared as const char *filename, which meets the rule.\n- In OS_SymbolTableDump the only pointer-like entities are:\n  - filename passed in as const char * (already const-qualified), and passed to OS_TranslatePath. The const qualification is preserved for input-only string data.\n  - translated_path is a modifiable local char array used as an output buffer (passed to OS_TranslatePath). It must be non-const because it is written to.\n  - &token is passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit and OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel; these APIs evidently modify or operate on the token, so the parameter cannot be const.\n- The OS_CHECK_POINTER(filename) macro checks the pointer but does not change the fact that filename is const-qualified.\n\nNo other pointer declarations or pointer-typed parameters exist in the provided fragments that could be made const without changing intended semantics. Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under Rule 8.13."
