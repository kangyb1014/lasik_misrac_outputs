  "explanation": "For deciding whether OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is dead code (i.e. executing it or keeping it would not affect program behaviour) you must examine how it is reached and how its result is used. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the direct caller named in the static call graph. You must inspect its implementation to see when/if it invokes OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl, how often, under what conditions, and whether removing the Impl call (or the Impl function entirely) would change observable program behaviour (return values, side effects, timing).\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The Impl returns this value. You must know the semantic meaning of this code in the system (is it treated specially by callers, causes alternate behavior, logged, used for control flow) to determine whether returning this constant (or removing the function) would change behaviour.\n\n- OS_printf: Shown as a callee of OS_SymbolTableDump. If the wrapper prints messages based on the Impl result, removal of the Impl (or changing its return) could alter visible output \u2014 relevant to whether removing the function changes behaviour.\n\n- OS_TranslatePath: A callee of OS_SymbolTableDump; needed to see whether OS_SymbolTableDump performs side-effecting operations (e.g. path translations) before/after calling the Impl. Those side effects may make the wrapper non-trivial even if the Impl is trivial.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit and OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: These indicate transactional or state-changing operations performed by the wrapper. If the wrapper always performs these around the Impl call, then the presence/absence of the Impl (or its behavior) could affect system state or timing \u2014 critical to dead-code determination.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These unit-test stub interfaces are invoked by OS_SymbolTableDump per the call graph. They can alter runtime behavior in test builds (e.g. cause the Impl to be bypassed, or inject different return values). You must inspect these to determine whether the Impl is ever actually used in any build/configuration and whether its removal would affect behavior in production or test configurations.\n\nTogether these symbols let you trace call paths, side effects, control flow and test-injection points to conclude whether OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour (dead code) or whether it contributes to behaviour and therefore must be retained."
