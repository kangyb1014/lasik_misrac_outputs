  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), and return_code is assigned from the function call OS_ObjectIdGetById just above, so the expression is not a compile-time or semantic invariant. There are no loops (while, for, do-while) or other conditional controlling expressions that could be constant. Macro arguments (OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE) are not used as controlling expressions here. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
