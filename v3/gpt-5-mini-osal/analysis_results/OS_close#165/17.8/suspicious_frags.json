  "explanation": "I inspected the entire OS_close function. The only parameter is filedes (type osal_id_t) and it is passed by value and never assigned to or otherwise modified in the function. The other identifiers (token and return_code) are local variables. The calls pass &token (a pointer to a local object) to other routines, but &token is not a function parameter of OS_close and the pointer variable filedes itself is not altered. There are no pointer parameters of OS_close whose value is modified. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
