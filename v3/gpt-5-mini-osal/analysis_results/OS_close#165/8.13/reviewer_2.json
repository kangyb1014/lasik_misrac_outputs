  "explanation": "The claim is conditionally correct but cannot be confirmed from the code shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed states that pointers should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 i.e., if a function does not modify the object addressed through a pointer parameter, that parameter ought to be declared as a pointer-to-const. If OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete (and similarly OS_GenericClose_Impl) do not modify the OS_object_token_t object, but their prototypes are declared with a non-const pointer (e.g. OS_object_token_t *token), that prototype would be contrary to Rule 8.13 and the report would be correct.\n\nHowever, the snippet of OS_close alone does not show the declarations or implementations of OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete or OS_GenericClose_Impl, nor whether those functions actually modify the object. The mere act of passing &token to a function whose parameter is non-const is not by itself a proved MISRA violation \u2014 the violation depends on the function prototype and whether the object really could be const. Therefore the report as stated is not verifiably correct from the provided code. To confirm the violation you must inspect the function declarations/implementations: if they do not modify the token and yet their parameter types are non-const, change the parameter types to pointer-to-const or provide a documented justification why they must be non-const."
