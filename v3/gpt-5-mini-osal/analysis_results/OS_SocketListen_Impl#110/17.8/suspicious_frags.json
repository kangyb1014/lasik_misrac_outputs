  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter. The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and there is no assignment to token (no token = ...). The macro invocation uses *token but expands to take the address (&(*token)) which yields the original pointer value; this only reads the parameter to compute an index. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const pointer and returns token->obj_idx without modifying it. The local variable impl is assigned from the table lookup (no change to the parameter), and listen() uses impl->fd (an object pointed to by impl), not the function parameter. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
