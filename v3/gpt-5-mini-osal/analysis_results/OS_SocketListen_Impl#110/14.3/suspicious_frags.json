  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The only control statement is: if (os_result < 0) \u2014 os_result is assigned from listen(impl->fd, 10), which is a runtime value, so the controlling expression is not invariant. There are no loops or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are used for array indexing and do not form controlling expressions; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token) reads token->obj_idx (a runtime value). No other constructs in the function create invariant controlling expressions that would trigger Rule 14.3 investigation."
