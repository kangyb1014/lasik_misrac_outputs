  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided code. Reasons:\n\n- The control flow in OS_SocketListen_Impl is conditional on the runtime value of os_result returned by listen(impl->fd, 10). Both the if branch (return OS_ERROR) and the final return (return OS_SUCCESS) are reachable depending on the runtime outcome, so there is no statically unreachable code inside the function.\n\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]). With the call site OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token) this becomes &OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which is a valid address computation; it does not introduce unreachable code (it does introduce potential runtime issues if token is invalid, but that is not a Rule 2.1 unreachable-code concern).\n\n- The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty. Its use inside the if-block simply results in no emitted debug call; this does not create unreachable code. (Also, macro arguments are not evaluated unless used in the macro expansion, so there is no hidden call to strerror when OS_DEBUG is empty.)\n\n- There are no constant conditions (e.g., if (0) or if (1)) or post-return statements that would be statically unreachable.\n\n- The additional definitions (OS_impl_filehandle_table array, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline, OS_impl_file_internal_record_t) do not contain constructs that create unreachable code in the shown function.\n\nBecause of the above, there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code). If you want, I can instead list potential runtime-safety issues (null/invalid token, out-of-bounds index, unchecked listen error detail) but those are not violations of Rule 2.1."
