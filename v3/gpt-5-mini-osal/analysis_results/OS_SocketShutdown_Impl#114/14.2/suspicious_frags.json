  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function or in the related inline/macro code shown. The Rule 14.2 requirement concerns the structure of for loops (first/second/third clauses, single loop counter, no modification in body, etc.). The target function OS_SocketShutdown_Impl contains only conditional (if/else) statements and a call to shutdown; there are no for loops to inspect. The related symbols/macros were checked: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array access using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (a static inline that returns token->obj_idx) \u2014 no for loops there; the extern table, struct and enum definitions contain no for statements. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. (Note: if the bodies of called library functions such as shutdown or any other non-supplied functions are to be considered, those source bodies would need to be reviewed separately for for-loop conformance.)"
