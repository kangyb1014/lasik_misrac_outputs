  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The function contains only conditional statements whose controlling expressions depend on runtime values: the Mode comparisons (if (Mode == ...), else if (Mode == ...)) depend on the Mode parameter; the if (shutdown(conn_impl->fd, how) == 0) depends on the runtime result of shutdown(). There are no loops or conditionals using constant/compile-time-invariant expressions (e.g. if (1), while (0), or a do-while with a constant false) that would trigger Rule 14.3. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and the table indexing use the token\u2019s obj_idx at runtime, so they are not invariant either. Therefore, there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
