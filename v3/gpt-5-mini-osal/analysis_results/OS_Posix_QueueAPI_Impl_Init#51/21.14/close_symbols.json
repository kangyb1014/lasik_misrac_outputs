  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the next analyser must confirm that no memcmp usage is hidden by macros, typedefs, or symbol definitions referenced in this function. Each symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- memset\n  - Confirm this is the standard library zero-fill function (and not a macro or wrapper that expands to memcmp or contains string comparisons). If memset is macro-redefined in the project, it could hide forbidden memcmp usage.\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table\n  - Determine its type and definition (array, pointer, struct) used in sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table). This rules out any implicit comparison operations or macro expansions tied to this symbol that might call memcmp.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - Inspect the global structure to see how TruncateQueueDepth is defined and initialized; ensure that assigning to this field does not invoke a macro or function that performs a memcmp-based string comparison.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth\n  - The specific field being assigned. Its type/definition could be a macro or accessor that hides further code (e.g., inline function or macro) that might use memcmp.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global\n  - The BSP global object must be inspected to see whether MaxQueueDepth is a plain member, macro, or accessor with side effects (could hide memcmp usage).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth\n  - Confirm what this symbol expands to (constant, macro, function call). If it is a macro or function, its body must be checked for any memcmp use or forbidden string comparisons.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C\n  - This macro is used in the non-permissive branch. Its definition must be inspected to ensure it is a simple constant/cast and not implemented via other macros or functions that use memcmp to compare strings.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE\n  - The compile-time configuration macro determines which assignment branch is used. Knowing its value (or whether it is defined) is necessary to know whether OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth or OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C is in effect and therefore which symbols to inspect.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - Verify this return macro/value is a plain constant and does not expand to code that could include memcmp or string comparison logic.\n\nIn summary: inspect any macro/function definitions and object/type declarations for these symbols to ensure none expand to or invoke memcmp (or otherwise compare null-terminated strings using memcmp). If all of the above are simple constants, types, or standard APIs (with memset being the real memset), the target function does not introduce a memcmp-on-strings violation."
