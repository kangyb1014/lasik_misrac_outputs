  "explanation": "No loop or conditional controlling expressions are present in the provided function that could be invariant. The function contains: \n- a call to memset (not a control statement),\n- compile-time preprocessor conditional (#ifdef / #else / #endif) which is resolved at build time (not a runtime controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3),\n- simple assignments to POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth, and\n- a return of the constant OS_SUCCESS.\n\nNone of these are runtime controlling expressions (for, while, do-while, if, switch) whose controlling expression could be invariant, so there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
