  "explanation": "- OS_impl_queue_table (declaration/type and element type): The function passes this object to memset; to check MISRA pointer-to-const concerns you must know whether the object is or contains pointer members (and their types) that might instead be declared as pointing to const. If elements are pointer types, their declarations determine whether const qualification is appropriate.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (struct definition): The code assigns to a member of this global; its full struct declaration is needed to inspect member types and any pointer members that could require const qualification.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth (member declaration/type): The specific type of this member (integer vs pointer or typedef) is required to decide whether it is a pointer that should be const-qualified.\n- OS_BSP_Global (struct definition): The source of MaxQueueDepth; its definition is needed to determine the type of that member and whether it is a pointer that should be const-qualified.\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth (member declaration/type): The concrete type of this member is needed to determine whether assigning it to TruncateQueueDepth involves pointer-to-non-const usage or conversions that affect constness.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C macro (definition/expansion): This macro is used as the zero initializer when the permissive-mode macro is not set; its expansion may cast or produce a typedef that affects whether a pointer type or integer type is used.\n- type(s) used by OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C (e.g. OS_blockcount_t typedef): If the macro expands to a typed constant, that typedef must be known to determine if it is a pointer type requiring const qualification.\n- memset prototype (declaration from <string.h>): To evaluate the call to memset against the MISRA rule you need the function parameter types (memset takes void * as destination) so you can determine whether passing OS_impl_queue_table violates a const-qualification requirement.\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE (compile-time macro): The conditional compilation controls which assignment is compiled; analysis must consider both configurations (macro defined vs not) so the macro must be known to see which symbols/expressions are active."
