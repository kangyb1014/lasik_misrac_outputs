  "explanation": "Only expressions that involve or may refer to pointer-typed objects are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The memset call uses OS_impl_queue_table (a pointer to the table storage) and therefore should be inspected to verify whether the object being pointed to ought to be const-qualified or why it must be modifiable. The assignment from OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth is included because MaxQueueDepth could be a scalar or a pointer-like entity (e.g. a pointer to configuration data); it should be checked to confirm the declared types and whether const qualification is appropriate. Other fragments do not involve pointer declarations or pointer operands and so do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function signature (int32 ... (void)) has no pointer parameters; the preprocessor conditionals and comments are not relevant; the assignment POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(0) sets an integral constant (no pointer); the return OS_SUCCESS is a scalar return; and the sizeof(...) usage is part of the memset call already listed. Therefore no other lines need to be investigated for pointer const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
