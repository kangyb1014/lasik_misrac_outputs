  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: memset writes to OS_impl_queue_table, so the object must be mutable and the pointer should not be const. Rule 8.13 (prefer pointers to const when possible) is not applicable here because the code deliberately modifies the object. A violation would occur if OS_impl_queue_table were declared const (e.g. const MyType OS_impl_queue_table[] or const MyType *OS_impl_queue_table) and the code attempted to call memset (or otherwise modify it) or if the code cast away const to call memset \u2014 that would breach const-correctness and thus violate Rule 8.13."
