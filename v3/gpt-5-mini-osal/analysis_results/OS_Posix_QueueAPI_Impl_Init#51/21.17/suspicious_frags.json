  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions. In this function the only invocation of a <string.h> function is the single memset call listed above, so it must be investigated. The remaining code lines are preprocessor conditionals, simple assignments to scalar or struct members, macro uses, and a return statement; none of these invoke string.h functions (e.g., strcpy, memcpy, strlen, etc.) or perform pointer-based buffer operations covered by Rule 21.17, so they do not need further investigation for this rule."
