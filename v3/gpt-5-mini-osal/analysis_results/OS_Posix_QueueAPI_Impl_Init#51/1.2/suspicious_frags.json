  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific notes:\n- The function signature (int32 ... (void)), use of memset, return statements, and preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #else / #endif) are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n- The array declaration and extern references shown in the additional code are standard C constructs.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs visible (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembler, pragma GCC diagnostic, __extension__, or other vendor-specific tokens).\n\nOne caveat: OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(0), OS_SUCCESS, and the typedef int32 are macros/typedefs whose definitions are not shown. Those could expand to or be defined using compiler-specific extensions, but no extension usage is visible in the supplied code. If required, reviewers should inspect the definitions of those macros/typedefs to ensure they do not rely on compiler extensions."
