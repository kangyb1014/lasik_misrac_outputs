  "explanation": "I selected the entire UtMem2BinFileCmp function plus the UtAssert_True macro definition and the UtAssert_GetContext implementation because indirect recursion could only arise via functions called from within UtMem2BinFileCmp. The only non-standard call chain here that could reasonably lead back to UtMem2BinFileCmp is via the test-assertion framework (UtAssert_True -> UtAssertEx). The implementation of UtAssertEx is not provided, so that macro usage must be investigated for possible indirect calls to UtMem2BinFileCmp. All other calls inside the function (fopen, fgetc, fclose, printf, strerror) are standard library routines and, as provided, do not call user-defined functions from this code; therefore they do not need to be inspected for MISRA Rule 17.2 in this context. No direct call from UtMem2BinFileCmp to itself is present in the shown code."
