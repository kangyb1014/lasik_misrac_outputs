  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C bounds analysis:\n\n- uint8 (typedef for byte type): The code indexes MemByte[i] where MemByte is declared as const uint8*. Knowing the exact width and signedness of uint8 is required to reason about byte-sized accesses and casts used in printf; it helps determine whether an index access can exceed element size assumptions.\n\n- uint32 (typedef for index type): 'i' is a uint32. Its width/magnitude and wrap/overflow behavior determine whether the loop index can overflow or otherwise permit out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses when file reading continues for many bytes.\n\n- FILE (FILE type): Needed to understand file stream semantics and lifetime (e.g., fgetc/fclose interactions) that control the loop termination and whether fgetc can block/behave differently for text/binary modes.\n\n- fopen (prototype): The opening mode and behavior (\"r\") determine how the file is presented to fgetc and whether certain translations (text mode) occur; also required to reason when fopen can fail and how the code handles that path.\n\n- fgetc (prototype): fgetc drives the loop termination by returning EOF or an unsigned char value promoted to int. Its return semantics (range, EOF sentinel) are essential to understand the loop condition and to ensure comparisons between FileByte and MemByte[i] are valid and do not cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds reading of Memory.\n\n- fclose (prototype): Ensures correct lifetime/cleanup of the stream; not directly affecting bounds but included to fully understand stream lifecycle in the function.\n\n- EOF (macro): The loop uses (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF. The exact sentinel and its type are needed to reason about when the loop ends and therefore whether more reads than buffer elements are possible.\n\n- errno (global) and strerror (prototype): strerror is a string.h function used for diagnostics; include them to confirm no string.h call in this function writes through user pointers and to understand error-handling behavior. Although strerror does not take the user buffer here, documenting its use completes the analysis of string.h usage in this function.\n\n- printf (prototype): Used to report miscompare or error. While not a string.h function, knowledge of its use and argument conversions (casting MemByte[i] to unsigned int) helps verify that reporting does not lead to misinterpretation of out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads (e.g., if MemByte[i] is accessed when i is out of range).\n\n- UtAssert_True (prototype): Called on fopen failure. Its behavior (does it longjmp/abort/return?) affects control flow after an fopen error and therefore whether subsequent code paths could access memory unsafely. Include to reason about post-failure control flow.\n\n- Memory buffer length / caller contract (the size associated with the Memory pointer): The function indexes Memory by i until EOF. To determine whether MemByte[i] may access beyond the bounds of the object referenced by Memory (the precise MISRA concern), you must know the length/allocated size of the memory object supplied by the caller or the contract that guarantees Memory is at least as large as the file. This is the single most important missing piece for a bounds-safety determination.\n\n- Caller functions that allocate/populate the Memory buffer (e.g., UtBinFile2Mem, UtMem2BinFile, UtMem2HexFile): If the Memory pointer is produced/filled by sibling utilities in the test harness, their allocation semantics and documented buffer sizes (or guarantees that Memory has at least the file length) are required to prove that MemByte[i] cannot index past the buffer. Include their prototypes/behavior to trace ownership, allocation size, and any guarantees about buffer length vs file length.\n\nRationale summary: The function does not call the standard string.h copy/compare functions (the MISRA rule targets those); the likely violation would be an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access of MemByte[i] if the file is longer than the caller-supplied Memory buffer. To decide that, you need the types used for indexing and bytes, the exact semantics of fgetc/EOF that control the loop, the caller contract that provides Memory and its size, and the behavior of UtAssert_True for control flow. strerror is included because it is a string.h function present in the function (for diagnostics) and should be considered when checking compliance with rules about string.h usage."
