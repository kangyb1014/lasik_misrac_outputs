  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs should not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 because they are functionally active and their removal would change program behaviour: the fopen call and its assignment determine whether the file is opened; the for loop with the fgetc() read and the MemByte[i] comparison perform the primary byte-by-byte comparison (these operations are clearly executed and affect the return value); the fclose(fp) is the required cleanup for an opened FILE; the break; changes control flow within the loop; the return Success; communicates the result to callers. Variable declarations (fp, FileByte, i, MemByte) are actually used in the logic above. Note that unreachable code (which is not shown) is outside the scope of Rule 2.2 per the MISRA note; the fragments flagged above are those most likely to be redundant/compiled-out (e.g. diagnostic prints or assertion calls that may be no-ops in some builds) and therefore warrant investigation."
