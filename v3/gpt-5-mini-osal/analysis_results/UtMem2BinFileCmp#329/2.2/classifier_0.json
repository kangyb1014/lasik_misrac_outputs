Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2BinFileCmp:\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            if (MemByte[i] != FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Success = false;\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File\");\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtMem2BinFileCmp:\n#define UtAssert_True(Expression, __VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(Expression,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nprintf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The printf statement is not dead code. It is executed on fopen failure and produces observable diagnostic output (and may affect program timing), so removing it would change program behaviour. Even if the subsequent UtAssert_True/UtAssertEx also reports the error, that redundancy cannot be assumed from the provided code, so the printf cannot be classified as dead code in this context."
