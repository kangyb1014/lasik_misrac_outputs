  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided code. The function UtMem2BinFileCmp compares bytes one-by-one using MemByte[i] != FileByte after reading with fgetc; it does not call memcmp or any wrapper that could be resolved to memcmp in the supplied additional definitions. The Filename parameter is used only as an fopen path and in printf, not compared via memcmp. No other string-comparison standard library calls (e.g. strcmp, strncmp) appear in the shown code or the supplied related definitions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp for null-terminated string comparison). If there are other translation units or macros not shown that might call memcmp, those would need to be inspected, but based on the provided code there is nothing to report."
