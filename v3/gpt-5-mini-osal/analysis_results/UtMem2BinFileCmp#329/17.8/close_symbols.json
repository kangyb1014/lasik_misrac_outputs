  "explanation": "fopen: Need the declaration/definition because it is called with the parameter 'Filename'. If fopen is a macro or an inline wrapper it could (theoretically) expand to code that assigns to or otherwise mutates the parameter identifier; confirm it does not modify the Filename parameter variable.\n\nfgetc: Used to read bytes from the opened file. Verify it is a normal library function and does not have a macro/inline variant that could modify local parameters (none expected, but must be checked to ensure no side-effect on Filename/Memory variables).\n\nfclose: Called to close the file; include to ensure no surprising macro behavior that could modify function parameters.\n\nprintf: Used to report a miscompare or error. If printf is implemented as a macro in this environment it could expand in a way that references or modifies caller parameters; include its definition to rule that out.\n\nstrerror: Used to obtain an error string for printing on fopen failure. Include to ensure it does not modify caller parameters.\n\nerrno: Global used in the strerror call. Include to check if errno is a macro or inline accessor that might reference caller parameter names (unlikely, but needed to be certain no parameter modification occurs).\n\nUtAssert_True: This test-framework symbol is called on fopen failure. It may be implemented as a macro that expands into code that could reference or assign to local variables/parameters (for example to capture context). Include its definition to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameters (Memory, Filename) or assign to them.\n\nUtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph and may be used internally by UtAssert_True. Include its definition to ensure any internal use does not modify parameters of UtMem2BinFileCmp (for example via macro expansion using caller parameter names).\n\nFILE: Type of 'fp' \u2014 include to ensure any unusual typedef or macro doesn't hide behavior that could alter parameters.\n\nEOF: Macro used in the fgetc loop condition. Include to ensure it is the standard constant and not an expression/macro that could have side effects.\n\nuint8, uint32, bool: Type definitions used in the function. Include their typedefs so the analyzer can correctly interpret the cast/assignment 'const uint8 *MemByte = Memory' and confirm that only a local pointer (MemByte) is assigned and that the parameter variable 'Memory' itself is not being modified (and similarly for 'Filename').\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule in question forbids modifying a function parameter variable (not the object it points to). To prove compliance we must (a) inspect every symbol that could be a macro/inline wrapper which might expand into code that assigns to the parameter identifiers (Memory or Filename), and (b) confirm standard library functions/macros are normal calls/constants. The listed symbols cover all functions, macros and types used in the function body (including the test framework helper(s) observed in the call graph) that could possibly lead to parameter modification by expansion or side effect."
