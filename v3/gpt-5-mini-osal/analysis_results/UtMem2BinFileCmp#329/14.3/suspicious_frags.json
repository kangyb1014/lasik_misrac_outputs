  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The if condition if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\"))) evaluates the dynamic result of fopen and is not constant. The for loop for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++) uses the return value of fgetc(fp) as its controlling expression and is therefore dynamic (not invariant). The UtAssert_True(false, ...) call is an argument containing a constant but is not itself a controlling expression (it is a function/macro call), so it does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no do-while loops or other conditional constructs with constant controlling expressions in this code. Therefore no code fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
