  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The for-loop controlling expression (i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS) depends on the loop variable i which is modified each iteration. The two if conditions (FuncKey == 0 || StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey) and (FuncKey == 0) depend on the parameter FuncKey and on the contents of the StubPtr structure, both of which can vary at run-time. The conditional inside UT_ClearStubEntry also depends on structure fields and a pointer value and is not invariant. There are no do-while loops or intentional infinite loops that would fall under the allowed exceptions. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
