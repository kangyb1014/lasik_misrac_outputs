  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required to judge MISRA rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS\n  - The for-loop controlling expression is i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS. To decide if that expression is invariant (e.g., a compile-time zero or fixed constant making the loop never iterate or always iterate), the analyser must know whether UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS is a compile-time constant, its value, and whether it can be changed during the loop.\n\n- UT_StubTable\n  - The code assigns StubPtr = UT_StubTable and then dereferences StubPtr in the if condition. The analyser needs the declaration/type/qualification of UT_StubTable (array vs pointer, volatile qualification, linkage) to determine whether reads of StubPtr->FuncKey can yield changing values across iterations or are invariant.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t\n  - The controlling expression references StubPtr->FuncKey. The struct definition is required to know the presence, type, and qualifiers (e.g., volatile) of the FuncKey member, and whether other members or layout imply aliasing or side-effects.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t\n  - FuncKey (the function parameter) and the member StubPtr->FuncKey use this type. Its signedness, width and any special qualifiers (volatile, enum with fixed value, typedef to a constant) affect whether comparisons to 0 or equality tests can be considered invariant.\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry\n  - UT_ClearStubEntry is invoked inside the loop and may modify the StubPtr->FuncKey (or other global/state) which directly affects the if controlling expression (StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey). To determine if the controlling expressions can change during loop execution, the analyser must see the implementation or precise specification of UT_ClearStubEntry (which members it clears/changes and whether it mutates globals).\n\n- UT_MaxStubSearchLen\n  - Although not part of a controlling expression, this global is assigned when FuncKey == 0. Its definition (type/qualification) can be useful to confirm there are no side effects relevant to invariance checks (e.g., if it were used in a macro that could affect loop bounds) and to fully understand state changes made by the function.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser determine whether the for-loop and if expressions can change during execution (because of variable i, table entries, called-function side-effects, or whether constants make the expressions invariant)."
