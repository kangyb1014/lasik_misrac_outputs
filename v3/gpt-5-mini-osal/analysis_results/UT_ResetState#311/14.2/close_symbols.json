  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry (full definition/implementation): The MISRA rule requires treating the behaviour of the for loop body as including any functions called within it. To determine whether the called function has persistent side effects that modify objects used in the for-clauses (for example UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS, the loop counter i, or any other object used in the second or third clause), the implementation of UT_ClearStubEntry must be examined.\n\n- UT_StubTable (declaration and definition/location): StubPtr is initialized from UT_StubTable and then incremented in the loop body. Knowing whether UT_StubTable is an array, pointer, volatile object, or has aliasing semantics is necessary to reason about whether operations on StubPtr (or accesses via StubPtr inside UT_ClearStubEntry) can affect objects used in the for-clauses.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t (type/struct definition, including the FuncKey member): The loop body reads StubPtr->FuncKey and passes StubPtr to UT_ClearStubEntry. To assess whether those operations could affect loop control (e.g. by aliasing or modifying objects used in the for-clauses) and to know what UT_ClearStubEntry may modify in the pointed-to object, the struct layout and members (especially FuncKey) are required.\n\n- UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS (macro/constant/variable definition): The second clause of the for uses UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS. MISRA requires that the second clause must not use objects that are modified in the loop body. You must know whether UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS is an immutable compile-time constant (safe) or a modifiable object (which UT_ClearStubEntry or other code might change), so its definition is required.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t (typedef/definition of FuncKey type): Knowing the type of FuncKey is needed to check whether any conversions or comparison semantics could introduce side effects or non-trivial behaviour relevant to the second-clause expression (FuncKey == 0 in the body) and to ensure no aliasing or unexpected modifications of loop-control variables arise.\n\n- UT_MaxStubSearchLen (declaration): Although UT_MaxStubSearchLen is modified after the loop, its declaration is needed to verify it is distinct from any object used in the for-clauses (so the post-loop write cannot be mistaken for an in-loop side effect). Also to check whether any called function inside the loop could modify this same object (relevance to overall side-effect reasoning).\n\n- int32 (typedef/definition): The loop counter i is declared as int32. The exact typedef is required to ensure the loop counter is a single scalar loop counter (to satisfy the \"only one loop counter\" clause) and to check whether any called code could access/modify it (e.g. by aliasing) \u2014 confirming that i is a local scalar and not accessible to UT_ClearStubEntry.\n\nThese symbols together allow the next analyst to determine (1) which objects are read or written in the for-header expressions, (2) whether any of those objects can be modified by the loop body or by called functions, and (3) whether there is more than one loop counter or any illegal modification of the loop counter within the loop body \u2014 i.e. to assess compliance with the MISRA requirement that the for loop be well-formed."
