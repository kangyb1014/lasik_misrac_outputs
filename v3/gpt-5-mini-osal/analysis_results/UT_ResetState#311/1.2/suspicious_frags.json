  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__, __asm__/__asm__, __inline__ (beyond standard C inline), typeof, statement-expressions, or other known vendor/GCC/MSVC extensions.\n- All non-standard identifiers shown (int32, cpuaddr, UT_EntryKey_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t, etc.) are typedefs or user-defined types/macros, not language extensions; their usage in the function is ordinary C and would not by itself constitute a compiler extension.\n- Aggregate initialization using {{0}} for the static array is standard C initialization (zero-initialization of nested aggregates), not an extension.\n- Control structures (for loop, if statements), pointer operations, calls to free/memset, and comparisons to 0 are standard C.\n\nIf there are additional files or macros that introduce compiler-specific constructs (for example, if the underlying definition of cpuaddr or any macro expands to a compiler-specific extension), those would need to be inspected; based on the code shown here, no suspicious fragments are present."
