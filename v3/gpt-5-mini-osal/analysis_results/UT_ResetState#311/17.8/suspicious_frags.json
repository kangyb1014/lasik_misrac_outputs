  "explanation": "No fragment in UT_ResetState modifies the function parameter FuncKey. The function only reads FuncKey (comparisons) and does not assign to it. The pointer StubPtr is a local variable that is incremented (++StubPtr) \u2014 not a function parameter \u2014 and UT_ClearStubEntry is called with that local pointer (the callee may modify the object pointed to, which is allowed). UT_MaxStubSearchLen is a global that is assigned only when FuncKey == 0. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
