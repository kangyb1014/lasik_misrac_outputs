The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the (only) caller of UtAssert_GetValueText per the call graph. To determine whether this function can appear in the body of a for loop and whether that loop might be invalidated by side effects of UtAssert_GetValueText, the caller\u2019s code and its loop structure must be inspected. Provide the caller so the analyzer can check calling contexts (for-loop clauses) and whether the function is invoked from a for loop.\n- UT_IntCheck_t: Type of the InValue parameter. The exact typedef/definition is required to know whether passing or casting InValue could invoke side effects (e.g., if it is a macro or volatile type) or whether it aliases a loop counter object in caller code.\n- UtAssert_Radix_t: Enumeration/type of RadixType. Needed to confirm possible control-flow paths inside the function and whether the enum or its values have special semantics (e.g., macros with side effects) that could affect for-loop analyses.\n- UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN, UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL, UtAssert_Radix_HEX: The specific enumerator values tested by the function. Their definitions ensure they are simple constants (no hidden side-effects) and help the analyzer enumerate all possible branches executed when the function is called from a for loop.\n- snprintf: This standard library function is the only function called by UtAssert_GetValueText. Its prototype/behavior must be known so the analyzer can determine whether calling it from a for-loop body could modify any objects other than the provided buffer (e.g., global state) or otherwise produce side effects that would violate MISRA requirements for the loop\u2019s second/third clauses.\n- size_t: Type of TempSz. Definition/width is required to reason about conversions and whether passing TempSz could interact with caller objects (e.g., aliasing or overflow issues) relevant to loop-counter safety.\n- bool: Type of IsUnsigned. Needed to confirm it is a simple boolean type (no side-effects) and to reason about the control flow choices inside the function when considering calls from for-loop bodies.\n- TempBuf (parameter): The buffer written by snprintf. The analyzer needs the semantics/ownership (is it caller-owned? could it alias a loop counter or object used in loop control?) to determine whether the function can modify objects that serve as a loop counter or are otherwise disallowed to be modified in the loop body.\n- TempSz (parameter): Size argument passed to snprintf. Its provenance (value, aliasing) must be known to ensure that the function does not indirectly modify or depend on objects that are loop counters.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine (1) whether UtAssert_GetValueText itself contains any for loops (it does not), (2) whether it or functions it calls (snprintf) have side effects that could violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness when UtAssert_GetValueText is placed in a for-loop body, and (3) whether the caller(s) invoke it in contexts that would make the function body part of a for-loop body that modifies a loop counter or other disallowed objects."
