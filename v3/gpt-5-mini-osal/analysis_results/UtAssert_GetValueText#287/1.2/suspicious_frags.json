  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- The use of bool/true/false relies on the standard C boolean type (_Bool/stdbool.h) and is not a compiler extension.\n- UT_IntCheck_t is typedef'd to ptrdiff_t, which is a standard type from <stddef.h>, not an extension.\n- snprintf is a standard library function (C99/POSIX), not a language extension.\n- The casts to (unsigned long)/(long) and the corresponding format specifiers (%lo, %lx, %lu, %ld) are standard C usage (the code performs explicit casts to match the format specifiers).\n- The enum definition with explicit integer values is standard C.\n- There are no compiler-specific constructs present (no __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, inline assembly, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or other vendor-specific keywords).\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that appear to use language extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 investigations."
