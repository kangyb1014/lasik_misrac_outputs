  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: TempBuf is used as the destination buffer for snprintf and therefore must be a modifiable (non-const) char *. The function writes into TempBuf, so it cannot be declared as const char *. Returning a const char * that points to the (modifiable) buffer is acceptable (conversion from char * to const char * is allowed) and does not violate the rule. A violation would occur if the buffer were declared as char * but never modified and should have been declared const char * instead."
