  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and their const-qualification. In this function the only pointer-related entities are the TempBuf parameter and the pointer returned from the function; the snprintf calls operate on that buffer. Other items in the function (InValue, IsUnsigned, RadixType, format strings, casts to long/unsigned long, and the use of snprintf itself) do not introduce pointer types that could be const-qualified and therefore do not need to be investigated for this rule. No other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions exist in the provided code fragment."
