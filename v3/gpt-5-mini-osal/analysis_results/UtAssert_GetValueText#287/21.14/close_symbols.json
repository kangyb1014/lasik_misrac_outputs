  "explanation": "- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the direct caller of UtAssert_GetValueText (per the call graph). To determine whether any memcmp usage exists that compares null-terminated strings produced by GetValueText you must inspect this caller\u2019s code and see how it uses the returned TempBuf (e.g., passed to memcmp).\n\n- UtAssert_DoCompare: Called by UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare; it may perform comparisons (including string comparisons) on values or texts supplied by the caller. If memcmp usage exists there, it could be comparing the null-terminated strings produced by GetValueText.\n\n- UtAssert_GetOpText: Also called by UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare; it may return operator strings or perform text manipulations that are compared against GetValueText outputs. Any memcmp usage here is relevant.\n\n- snprintf: The target function uses snprintf to format into TempBuf. Understanding snprintf semantics (it guarantees null-termination when TempSz>0) is necessary to decide whether the buffers produced are NUL-terminated strings \u2014 which is central to deciding if downstream memcmp calls are comparing null-terminated strings (the MISRA concern).\n\n- UT_IntCheck_t: The integer typedef used for InValue affects how values are formatted/cast. Knowing its definition (signed/unsigned width) helps confirm that formatted output contains only textual digits/letters and a terminating NUL, i.e., is a proper C string.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_t and constants (UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN, UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL, UtAssert_Radix_HEX): These control which formatting branch executes (\"true\"/\"false\", octal, hex, unsigned, signed). You must confirm what string forms GetValueText produces so you can assess whether downstream memcmp calls are being applied to null-terminated strings.\n\n- calling-site TempBuf/TempSz allocations in UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: The actual buffers and sizes passed into GetValueText (allocation size, TempSz value) must be examined to ensure snprintf had sufficient space and therefore did (or did not) NUL-terminate the buffer; insufficient size could lead to non-terminated output and change whether memcmp would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\nCollecting these symbols (caller implementations, type/enum definitions, snprintf behavior, and the specific buffer allocation/size at the call site) is sufficient to determine whether any memcmp usage in the calling chain compares null-terminated strings produced by UtAssert_GetValueText, and therefore whether the MISRA rule is implicated."
