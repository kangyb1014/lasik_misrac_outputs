  "explanation": "uint32: the typedef/definition of uint32 is needed to confirm Length is an integral scalar (not a pointer or struct) so uses of Length inside the function cannot be considered modifications of a pointer parameter.\n\nuint8: the typedef/definition of uint8 is needed to confirm the element type pointed to by Byte_ptr (and ultimately Memory). Knowing the underlying object type is required to decide whether Byte_ptr[i] modifies the object pointed to (allowed) rather than modifying a pointer parameter (disallowed).\n\nimplicit conversion: void * -> uint8 *: the language-level rule that assigns a void* value to a uint8* (Byte_ptr = Memory) must be known to determine whether that statement changes the parameter Memory itself or simply copies its value into a local pointer. This confirms the pointer parameter is not modified by the assignment.\n\nsemantics of array indexing and assignment (Byte_ptr[i] = i): the expression semantics (Byte_ptr[i] is equivalent to *(Byte_ptr + i)) are required to show that the code modifies the object at the computed address (the pointee) and does not modify the pointer variables (Byte_ptr or Memory). This is the core fact for deciding conformance with the MISRA rule that pointer parameters themselves must not be modified while pointees may be."
