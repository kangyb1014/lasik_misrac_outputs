  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. UtMemFill does not call any functions (no direct calls, no calls via function pointers, and no macros/inline calls are present in the body). The MISRA rule about self-calling (direct or indirect recursion) is checked by following the call graph outward from the target function; because UtMemFill has no outgoing calls, there is no path that could lead back to itself, so no other function symbols are needed for this specific recursion analysis."
