  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function UtMemFill contains no function calls at all (neither direct nor indirect): it performs a local for-loop, an assignment of the void* parameter to a uint8* pointer, and indexed byte writes. There are no calls to UtMemFill (self-call), no other function calls, no function pointers invoked, and no callbacks present in the code fragment. Therefore there is nothing that could constitute direct or indirect recursion to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
