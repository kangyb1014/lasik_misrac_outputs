Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are not candidates for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code):\n- The function signature and parameter list are required for linkage and specification of behaviour and cannot be classified as dead code.\n- The declarations uint32 i; and uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; are used by the loop (the pointer initialization is an initialization, and per the rule notes initializations are not candidates for dead code).\n- There is no unreachable code in this function (every statement potentially executed depends on the runtime Length value), so the unreachable/dead-code distinction does not apply to other lines.\n- No other statements perform operations that are unused or provably have no effect on observable behaviour within this function, so they need not be investigated for Rule 2.2."
