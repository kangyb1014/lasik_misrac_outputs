  ],
  "explanation": "1) typedef uint8: The function uses uint8 *Byte_ptr and performs writes (Byte_ptr[i] = i). To decide whether the pointer should be to a const-qualified type you must know the exact definition of uint8 (is it plain, const or volatile-qualified, or an alias to some other type). If uint8 is already const-qualified the code could violate or conform differently.  \n2) typedef uint32: The Length parameter is typed uint32. Knowing the exact uint32 typedef ensures there are no surprising qualifiers or type aliases that affect the pointer qualification analysis (e.g., if uint32 is a typedef to a const-qualified type or a pointer type).  \n3) header prototype/declaration of UtMemFill: The public declaration (in the header) might differ from the definition (for example it might declare the Memory parameter as const void *). An inconsistency or a header-level const would directly affect whether the function violates the rule or removes constness.  \n4) any macro/typedef that changes qualifiers of uint8/uint32: Preprocessor macros or alternate typedefs could add/remove const/volatile qualifiers (or redefine types). The analysis must consider the actual effective type/qualifiers seen by the compiler to determine whether pointer-to-const should have been used or if const is being illegally discarded."
