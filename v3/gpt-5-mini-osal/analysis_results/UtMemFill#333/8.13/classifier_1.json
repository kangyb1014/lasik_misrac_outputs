  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. UtMemFill writes into the memory (Byte_ptr[i] = i), so the parameter must be a pointer to a modifiable object; using void * is appropriate. A violation would occur if the function did not modify the pointed-to data but the parameter were declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. a read-only buffer passed as void * instead of const void *)."
