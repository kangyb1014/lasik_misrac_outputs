  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 applies to pointer types and whether the pointed-to type could/should be const-qualified. In the provided function the only pointer-related constructs are listed above and therefore should be investigated. Other code fragments in the function are scalar declarations and loop control (e.g. uint32 i; the for-loop header, the Length parameter as a non-pointer), and do not involve pointer types or pointer-to-type qualifications, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need to be investigated."
