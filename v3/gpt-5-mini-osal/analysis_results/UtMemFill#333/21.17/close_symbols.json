This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether UtMemFill can access memory beyond the bounds of the object referenced by its Memory pointer (the concern of the MISRA string-handling/out-of-bounds rule), an analyzer needs more context than the function body alone: \n\n- uint8 (typedef / macro definition): The exact type behind uint8 (e.g., unsigned char) determines element size and pointer arithmetic semantics. If uint8 is not a one\u2011byte type in the project, indexing computations change. \n\n- uint32 (typedef / macro definition): Knowledge of the integer type used for i and Length is needed to reason about loop bounds, wrap/overflow behavior, and implicit conversions when assigning i into a uint8 location.\n\n- All callers of UtMemFill: To know actual argument values and possible caller-side invariants (e.g., always passing buffer size), you must inspect every call site that supplies Memory and Length.\n\n- Definitions of the buffer objects passed as the Memory argument at each call site: You must know the actual object sizes (array length, allocated block size) of the buffers passed as Memory to determine whether indexing Byte_ptr[i] can exceed those sizes.\n\n- Definitions (symbols) of the expressions or macros used to compute Length at each call site: If Length is computed from macros, constants, or functions (e.g., sizeof(buffer)/..., constants like BUF_SIZE), those definitions are required to establish the bound used in the loop.\n\n- Any preprocessor macros that rename or replace UtMemFill, uint8, or uint32: A macro could change the semantics (e.g., replace UtMemFill with a wrapper that calls memcpy) or change types; the source-level function body might not be the real code executed.\n\n- Project typedefs / stdint mappings: Knowing whether uint8 maps to uint8_t/unsigned char and uint32 to a 32-bit unsigned type lets you reason about range, implicit conversions and whether writing Byte_ptr[i] = i truncates/wraps values (not directly a string.h issue but relevant to harmful behavior and bounds reasoning).\n\n- Any annotations or static-analysis/contract attributes on UtMemFill or the caller buffers: Annotations may assert buffer sizes or preconditions (e.g., Memory points to Length bytes) which affect whether the function is compliant.\n\n- Platform/ABI size information if non\u2011standard: If the target platform has unusual type sizes, pointer arithmetic and element sizes may differ; include any build/config symbols that affect type sizes.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule quoted specifically targets standard string.h functions. UtMemFill does not call those functions directly, so the primary question becomes whether this custom memory-writting loop can produce out-of-bounds accesses. The symbols above provide the necessary context (type widths, call-site buffer sizes and Length values, and any macro/ABI surprises) to make that determination."
