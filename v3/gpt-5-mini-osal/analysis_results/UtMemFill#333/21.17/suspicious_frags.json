  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 specifically addresses the use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). The provided function UtMemFill does not call any of those standard string functions. It performs raw byte writes via a uint8* pointer and a loop, so there are no uses of <string.h> APIs to inspect for potential out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: Although the loop writes Byte_ptr[i] and could write beyond the actual object if the caller supplies an invalid Memory/Length pair, that is a general bounds-safety issue (caller responsibility / other MISRA rules) and not an instance of using <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
