  "explanation": "I examined the provided function OS_NetworkGetHostName, its implementation OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl, and the related macros. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There are no calls to memcmp (or any other standard-library string-comparison function used improperly) in the supplied code. The code uses gethostname and explicit null termination (host_name[name_len - 1] = 0) and assigns host_name[0] = 0 on failure \u2014 none of these are memcmp usages. The macros OS_CHECK_POINTER and OS_CHECK_SIZE perform parameter checks but do not perform string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided sources that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
