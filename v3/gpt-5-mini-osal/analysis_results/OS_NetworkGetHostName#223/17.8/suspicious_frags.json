  "explanation": "I found no fragments that modify a function parameter variable itself. All assignments in the code write to the object pointed to by the pointer parameters (e.g., host_name[0] = 0 and host_name[name_len - 1] = 0), which is explicitly allowed by Rule 17.8. There are no reassignments to the pointer parameters (no statements like host_name = ... or name_len = ...). The macros OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name) and OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) expand to checks (BUGCHECK/ARGCHECK) that do not perform assignments to the parameters. The precondition checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER and OS_CHECK_SIZE) ensure host_name is non-NULL and name_len > 0, so the index writes cannot underflow or dereference NULL. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
