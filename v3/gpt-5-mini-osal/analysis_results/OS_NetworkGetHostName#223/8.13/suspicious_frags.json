  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n\n- The parameter host_name in OS_NetworkGetHostName and OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl is an output buffer that the functions (and the underlying gethostname call) write into. Because the buffer is modified (host_name[0] = 0 on failure; host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 and gethostname writes into it on success), it must not be const. Therefore declaring it as char * is appropriate and not a Rule 8.13 violation.\n\n- The macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_SIZE, BUGCHECK, ARGCHECK) operate on the pointer value for validation and do not imply a requirement for pointer-to-const in the function signatures. They are generic checks and do not change whether an argument should be const-qualified.\n\n- The underlying POSIX function gethostname has the signature that expects a char * buffer to be filled; this constrains the implementation signature and justifies the non-const pointer parameter.\n\nNo other pointer parameters or pointer declarations are present in the provided code that appear to be candidates for adding const qualification. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
