  "explanation": "I have reported locations that should be investigated for possible unreachable code because they involve macros or constructs that may produce non-local control flow (BUGCHECK / BUGCHECK_VOID / ARGCHECK / OS_CHECK_*), or they perform array-indexing based on a size argument that might be constrained by other code paths. These are the places where unreachable code is most likely to be introduced due to abort/return behavior of the macros or to assumptions about parameter ranges.\n\nOther fragments in the provided code were not included because they are simple constant definitions, straightforward return statements, local variable declarations, or normal conditional branches whose reachability does not depend on the non-local behavior of the macros. For example, the definitions of OS_SUCCESS and OS_INVALID_POINTER, the local declarations of return_code, the gethostname() conditional structure (apart from the sentinel assignment already flagged), and the UtAssert_Abort function body as given do not by themselves indicate unreachable code without further macro/implementation details; they therefore do not require investigation for Rule 2.1 in this context. If deeper macro definitions (e.g. exact expansion of BUGCHECK/BUGCHECK_VOID/ARGCHECK) or attributes indicating non-return were provided, additional fragments might need to be added, so the listed fragments are the conservative set to examine first."
