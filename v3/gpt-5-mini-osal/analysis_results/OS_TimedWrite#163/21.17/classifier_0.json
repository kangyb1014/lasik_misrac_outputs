  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any <string.h> functions, so by itself it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (is_rule_violated = false). A specific violation scenario would occur if OS_GenericWrite_Impl uses functions such as memcpy/memmove/strcpy/etc. with the passed buffer and nbytes while there is no contract guaranteeing that the object referenced by buffer is at least nbytes long (or, for string functions, that it is NUL-terminated). For example, if buffer actually points to a smaller object and OS_GenericWrite_Impl does memcpy(dest, buffer, nbytes), this would access beyond the bounds of buffer and violate Rule 21.17."
