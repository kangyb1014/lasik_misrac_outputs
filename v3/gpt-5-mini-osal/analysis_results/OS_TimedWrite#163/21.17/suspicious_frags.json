  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions that operate on pointer/size parameters. The fragments listed are the points where a user buffer and its size are introduced or passed into another routine that may perform memory/string operations \u2014 these should be inspected to ensure any internal use of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/etc. cannot access beyond object bounds. Other fragments in the function (local variable declarations, OS_ObjectIdGetById call that deals with object ids, OS_ObjectIdRelease, return handling) do not involve the user-supplied buffer or a size parameter and do not themselves invoke C string/memory functions, so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for this rule."
