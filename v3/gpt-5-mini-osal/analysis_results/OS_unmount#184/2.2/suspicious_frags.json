  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains parameter validation, object lookup, table access, token handling/release, and the flags update that clears the MOUNTED bits; these operations affect program flow or persistent state and therefore are not dead code and do not need investigation for Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n- The OS_CHECK_STRING / pointer/length checks validate input and may cause early error returns. These are necessary control-flow operations.\n- The OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch call (and its return_code handling) and the use of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET are required to locate the object and decide the subsequent path; they are not removable without changing behavior.\n- The filesys->flags &= ~(OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL); write changes the object state and is therefore not dead.\n- The OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) call finalizes the object transaction and must be performed when a token was acquired.\nNo other code fragments in the function appear to be operations whose removal would have no effect on program behaviour."
