  "explanation": "All other code in the function appears to be straight-line, runtime-executed logic (variable declarations, retrieval of impl/module from the object tables, dl_mode = RTLD_NOW, dlerror(); impl->dl_handle = dlopen(...); and return status;). None of those statements are statically unreachable within the local context of this function because their execution depends on runtime values (token, module->flags, and the result of dlopen). The only places where unreachable code could exist are conditional branches whose conditions might be invariant due to higher-level program invariants (for example, if OS_MODULE_FLAG_LOCAL_SYMBOLS is guaranteed always set/cleared for these modules, or if dlopen is guaranteed to always succeed/fail in this environment). Those cases require investigation of global invariants outside this function; hence the two conditional branches above are the suspicious fragments selected for further investigation. No other fragments in the provided function are candidates for unreachable-code violations based on the local code alone."
