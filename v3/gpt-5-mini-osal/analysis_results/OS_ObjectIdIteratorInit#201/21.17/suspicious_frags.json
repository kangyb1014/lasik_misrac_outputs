  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this code fragment. The function only performs pointer/member assignments and calls to other functions (OS_GetMaxForObjectType, OS_GetBaseForObjectType, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit). There are no buffer copies, string operations, or uses of the standard string functions in the shown lines. Therefore there are no code fragments here that would directly violate or need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: if the implementations of the called functions use <string.h> routines, those implementations should be reviewed separately; they are not part of this fragment.)"
