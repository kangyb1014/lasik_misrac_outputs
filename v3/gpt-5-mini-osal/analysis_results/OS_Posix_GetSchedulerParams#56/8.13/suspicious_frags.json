  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not present additional potential Rule 8.13 issues: the assignments PriLim->PriorityMax = ret; and PriLim->PriorityMin = ret; demonstrate that the function intentionally modifies the object pointed to by PriLim, so the pointer cannot be const-qualified. The other OS_DEBUG invocations that do not use strerror and the casts (int)PriLim->PriorityMin / PriorityMax are not pointer declarations and are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. The sched_get_priority_min/max and errno usages involve library APIs whose pointer return types/prototypes are outside this translation unit (e.g. strerror returns char* per POSIX), and string literals in the format arguments are not user pointer declarations to be const-qualified here. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty in the provided additional code, so it does not introduce user pointer declarations. Therefore only the function parameter and the uses of strerror(...) are worth investigating with respect to whether pointers could/should be const-qualified."
