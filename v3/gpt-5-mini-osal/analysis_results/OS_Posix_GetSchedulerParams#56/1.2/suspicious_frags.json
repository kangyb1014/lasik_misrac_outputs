  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs (static function, int, casts, return, conditional checks) and POSIX library calls (sched_get_priority_max/min, strerror, errno). The use of bool is the C99 boolean type (requires <stdbool.h>), which is part of standard C and not a compiler extension. There are no GCC/Clang extension tokens (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm), no inline assembly, no vendor-specific keywords, and no other nonstandard syntax present. The only macro referenced (OS_DEBUG) is not defined in the shown fragment; if its definition uses compiler-specific extensions it would need separate review, but that definition is outside the provided code and therefore not flagged here. Based on the visible code, there are no language extensions to report."
