A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether any of the controlling expressions in OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams are invariant, the analyzer must know the origins, types and possible values of the operands used in those expressions. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- sched_get_priority_max\n  - The controlling expression ret < 0 depends directly on the return value of this function. The analyzer needs the prototype/semantics (possible return range, errno behavior) to determine whether ret can vary at runtime or is effectively constant for given sched_policy values.\n\n- sched_get_priority_min\n  - Same rationale as above for the second ret < 0 check and for the values assigned to PriLim->PriorityMin. Also needed to assess the subtraction (PriorityMax - PriorityMin) controlling expression.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t\n  - The fields PriorityMax and PriorityMin are used in a controlling expression ((PriorityMax - PriorityMin) < 4). The analyzer needs the structure definition and the types (signed vs unsigned, width) of these fields to reason about overflow/wraparound and whether the subtraction can vary at runtime.\n\n- OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init\n  - This function is the caller that supplies sched_policy (and possibly the PriLim pointer) to OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams. To determine if the controlling expressions could be invariant in actual use, the analyzer must inspect how sched_policy is produced/passed (e.g., if it is a compile-time constant or always the same value), and whether PriLim can be a constant/aliased object.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Although not part of the controlling expressions, the macro/function could have side effects or be defined in a way that affects visibility or evaluation. The analyzer should confirm it does not alter control flow or evaluation semantics relevant to invariance.\n\n- strerror\n  - Used in the debug messages, but included to verify it has no effect on the controlling expressions (side effects or macros that could change errno/ret). Mainly to rule out hidden invariance caused by side effects.\n\n- errno\n  - The diagnostic uses errno; the analyzer should ensure errno is not being (unexpectedly) modified by inline/macro definitions of the above functions or debug machinery that could affect the logic used to judge invariance.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary behavioral, type and calling-context information to determine whether the if conditions in the function can be considered invariant (constant) or are genuinely runtime-dependent. Additional low-level language/type definitions (e.g., bool, int) are assumed available from standard headers and are not listed here."
