  "explanation": "- OS_DEBUG: This logging macro/function is called with format strings and string arguments. Its definition/implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not internally compare null-terminated strings using memcmp (e.g. in message formatting, filtering, or conditional logging code).\n- sched_get_priority_max: An external OS API called by the function. To prove no indirect violation, its implementation (or any wrapper used in the project) must be checked for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings.\n- sched_get_priority_min: Same rationale as sched_get_priority_max \u2014 examine implementation/wrappers for any memcmp usage on C strings.\n- strerror: Returns a C string and is passed into OS_DEBUG. Although the standard strerror typically does not use memcmp for string comparisons, its implementation in the target environment/library should be checked for memcmp use when comparing or handling null-terminated strings.\n- errno: The global error indicator is used to obtain the string passed to strerror; include it to trace error-handling paths and any library calls that might perform string comparisons involving errno-derived messages.\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: The struct/type definition (PriorityMin/PriorityMax types) must be known to confirm there are no hidden string fields or helpers that could perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n- memcmp: Include the memcmp symbol itself so the next analysis can search the codebase and the implementations of the above symbols (and their transitive callees) for any uses of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nThese symbols together let the analyzer determine whether this function or any functions it directly calls (or macros it expands to) use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, which would violate the MISRA rule."
