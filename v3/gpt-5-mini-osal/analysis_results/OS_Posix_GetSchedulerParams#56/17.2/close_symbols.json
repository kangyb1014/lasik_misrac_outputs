  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine its callers and any functions those callers invoke that could lead back to OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams. The static call graph shows OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams is called by OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init, which in turn is called by OS_API_Impl_Init. Therefore: \n- OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init: required so the analyzer can inspect its body for any calls (direct or transitive) that might call back to OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams, creating an indirect recursion cycle. \n- OS_API_Impl_Init: required so the analyzer can inspect its body (and any functions it calls) for paths that eventually reach OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams via OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init or other routes. \nIf either of these contains calls (direct or through other functions) that lead back to OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams, that would constitute an indirect self-call and violate the MISRA rule. Analyzing their full implementations (and any additional callees discovered within them) is therefore necessary."
