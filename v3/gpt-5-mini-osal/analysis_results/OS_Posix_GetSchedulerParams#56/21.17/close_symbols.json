  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule about string.h functions causing out-of-bounds accesses we need the following additional symbols and why:\n\n- strerror: The function is called in this routine. Although strerror has no pointer parameter (it returns a pointer), we must confirm its contract (returns pointer to a NUL-terminated string, static vs thread-local buffer, maximum length guarantees) to ensure that reading the returned string with %s or copying it cannot read/write beyond its bounds.\n\n- errno: Passed to strerror. Knowing whether errno is used/modified here or by callers helps confirm the correct error string is retrieved, and whether any non-standard strerror implementation is used.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: The call-site passes the strerror result into OS_DEBUG. The implementation of OS_DEBUG is critical \u2014 if it performs formatting/copying into internal buffers it might use <string.h> functions (strcpy/strcat) or stdio formatting (snprintf). We must inspect OS_DEBUG's prototype and source to see which string functions it calls and whether they are used safely.\n\n- OS_DEBUG internal buffer(s) and their sizes / implementation details: If OS_DEBUG writes into fixed-size buffers, we need their sizes to determine whether passing %s with the strerror result (or any formatted data) could overflow those buffers.\n\n- snprintf / vsnprintf / vsprintf (if used by OS_DEBUG): These stdio functions are commonly used for formatting inside logging macros. vsnprintf with a correct size is safe; older/unsafe variants may cause buffer overruns. Knowing whether and how they are used is needed to judge compliance with the string functions rule.\n\n- strcpy / strncpy / strcat / strncat (if used by OS_DEBUG): These are the exact functions named in the MISRA rule. If OS_DEBUG or any code called here uses them, we must inspect call sites and buffer sizes to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t (definition): To fully understand the code path and types (PriorityMin/PriorityMax types and ranges) so we can reason about any potential integer conversions that might indirectly affect buffer size calculations or logging formatting (casts to int in printf), although this is secondary to string-function use.\n\n- sched_get_priority_max and sched_get_priority_min: Their behavior (return values and errno-setting) is used to decide whether strerror is invoked. Confirming they only produce -1 on error (and set errno) ensures no unexpected paths lead to malformed strings being passed to OS_DEBUG.\n\nIn short: the key item to review for the MISRA string-handling rule is the implementation and buffering behavior of OS_DEBUG (and any string functions it uses). strerror and errno must be known to confirm the string passed is a valid NUL-terminated C string. The other symbols provide context and ensure no indirect path causes unsafe string usage."
