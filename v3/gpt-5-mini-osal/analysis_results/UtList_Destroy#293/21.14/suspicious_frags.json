  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code (UtList_Destroy, UtList_Reset, UtList_DeleteNode and the shown calls). There are no uses of memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp) or any string comparison on null-terminated strings in the presented fragments. The functions operate on list nodes, pointers and call free(), but do not perform byte-wise comparisons of C strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If additional functions such as UtList_Extract or other modules exist, those should be searched for any memcmp usages \u2014 none appear in the shown code.)"
