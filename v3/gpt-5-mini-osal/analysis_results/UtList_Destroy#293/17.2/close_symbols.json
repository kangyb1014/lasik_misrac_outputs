  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Destroy violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls we must follow every call path that starts from UtList_Destroy and check for a path back to UtList_Destroy. Specifically:\n\n- UtList_Reset: UtList_Destroy calls this directly. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls UtList_Destroy.\n- UtList_DeleteNode: UtList_Reset calls this (per the static graph). You must inspect UtList_DeleteNode to determine whether it calls UtList_Destroy (or calls other functions that do).\n- (all transitive callees of UtList_DeleteNode): Any function called (directly or indirectly) by UtList_DeleteNode could complete a cycle back to UtList_Destroy; their bodies are required to prove absence/presence of indirect recursion.\n- UtTest_Run: UtList_Destroy has a recorded caller UtTest_Run. Although callers alone do not create recursion, a cycle can involve callers if a function reachable from UtList_Destroy eventually calls UtTest_Run (or any other caller) which then calls back into UtList_Destroy. Include UtTest_Run to check this possibility.\n- (all transitive callees of UtTest_Run): Inspecting these ensures there is no path from functions reachable by UtList_Destroy to UtTest_Run (or its callees) that would close a recursive cycle.\n\nIn short: you need the implementations of the direct callee chain starting at UtList_Reset (and all of their transitive callees), and the implementations of the caller side (UtTest_Run and its callees) to reliably determine whether any call path returns to UtList_Destroy."
