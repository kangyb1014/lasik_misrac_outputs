  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The for-loop fragment does not call any functions from <string.h>, so Rule 21.17 (which concerns misuse of string handling functions) is not violated by this fragment. A possible (hypothetical) violation would require a string function call that accesses memory beyond the Tags array bounds \u2014 for example, if NumberOfTags exceeds the actual allocated size of ListHead->Tags and UtList_Reset (or some call inside it) used strcpy/memcpy into &ListHead->Tags[i]. That situation is not shown here, so based on the given fragment Rule 21.17 is not violated."
