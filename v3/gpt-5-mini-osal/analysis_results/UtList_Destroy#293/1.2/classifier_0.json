  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment 'uint32 i;' uses an identifier that is most likely a user-defined typedef (e.g. typedef uint32_t uint32;) rather than a compiler language extension. MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 concerns compiler-specific language extensions explicitly documented as extensions; nothing in this fragment indicates such an extension. If 'uint32' were a compiler-specific type introduced as a documented extension rather than a typedef, it would violate the rule."
