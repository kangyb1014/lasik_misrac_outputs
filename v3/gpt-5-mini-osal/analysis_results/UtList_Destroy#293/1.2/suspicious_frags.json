  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs are plain standard C and do not by themselves indicate use of compiler language extensions: the function signature, the for-loop syntax (including the ++i pre-increment), the use of free(), and the call to UtList_Reset() are all standard C. The two reported fragments should be investigated because \"uint32\" may be a compiler- or project-specific typedef or an extended builtin type, and indexing into ListHead->Tags (as shown in the UtList_Reset call) may rely on how Tags is declared (e.g. flexible array member vs. zero-length array), which can involve compiler-specific behavior. No other tokens in the snippet suggest explicit compiler language extensions."
