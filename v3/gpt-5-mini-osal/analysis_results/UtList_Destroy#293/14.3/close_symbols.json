  "explanation": "To decide whether the for-loop controlling expression (i < ListHead->NumberOfTags) is invariant you must know whether either operand can change during the loop or be treated as constant by the compiler/analysis. The required symbols are:\n\n- UtListHead_t (structure definition): shows layout and relationship of NumberOfTags and Tags. Needed to determine whether accessing Tags[i] can alias or affect NumberOfTags or whether NumberOfTags is stored separately (affects whether the controlling expression can change).\n\n- UtListHead_t::NumberOfTags (declaration/type/qualifiers): you must know its exact type and qualifiers (e.g., volatile, atomic, const) because a const or compile-time constant would make the expression invariant, while volatile/atomic indicates it may change asynchronously. Its width/signedness also affects comparison semantics with uint32 i.\n\n- UtListHead_t::Tags (declaration and element type): the loop passes &ListHead->Tags[i] to UtList_Reset. Knowing the element type and whether writing through that pointer can (legally or via casts/aliasing) modify NumberOfTags is necessary to determine if the controlling expression can change during iteration.\n\n- uint32 (typedef / exact integer type): the type of i determines increment/wrap behaviour and implicit conversion rules when compared to NumberOfTags. If i and NumberOfTags have different signedness/width, the comparison semantics (and potential invariance) can be affected.\n\n- UtList_Reset (full prototype and implementation): the function called each iteration could modify the list head or NumberOfTags (directly or via casts/aliasing). Its body is required to see whether it (or callees) change ListHead->NumberOfTags or the memory containing it, making the controlling expression variant.\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode (implementation called by UtList_Reset, if any): because UtList_Reset calls other functions, those callees may perform modifications to the head/NumberOfTags. Include their implementations when reasoning about side effects that could make the loop condition variant.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next analyzer determine whether i < ListHead->NumberOfTags is genuinely variant across iterations (satisfying MISRA) or effectively invariant (potential MISRA violation)."
