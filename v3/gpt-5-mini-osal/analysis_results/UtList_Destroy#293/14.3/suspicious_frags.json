  "explanation": "The only controlling expression in this function is the for-loop header: for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i). That expression depends on the loop variable i (which is modified each iteration) and on ListHead->NumberOfTags; because i is incremented the controlling expression is not invariant and therefore does not prima facie violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no while or do-while loops with constant conditions, no if/switch with compile-time constant conditions, and no intentional infinite-loop constructs present that would require the stated exceptions. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
