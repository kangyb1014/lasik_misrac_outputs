  "explanation": "For checking MISRA's 'no unreachable code' rule inside and for the reachability of UtList_Destroy itself:\n\n- UtListHead_t: need the struct definition (members NumberOfTags and Tags) to know the type and semantics of NumberOfTags and Tags[i]. A compile-time constant or unusual definition could make the loop body or subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- uint32: need the typedef/underlying integer type to reason about loop induction, comparisons and unsigned wrap behaviour that could affect reachability of loop body or the free(ListHead) call.\n\n- UtList_Reset: the function called in the loop must be inspected to determine whether it is annotated or implemented as non-returning (e.g. calls exit/longjmp or has a noreturn attribute) or if it otherwise makes the rest of UtList_Destroy unreachable (for example by modifying ListHead/NumberOfTags or terminating the program).\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode: UtList_Reset's callee shown in the call graph; include it to inspect transitive non-returning behaviour (exit/longjmp/abort) or side effects that could make later code unreachable.\n\n- free: include the definition/macro for free to ensure it is the normal deallocation function (i.e. returns) and has not been redefined to a non-returning macro or made conditional in a way that affects reachability.\n\n- UtTest_Run: the immediate caller of UtList_Destroy (from the call graph). Include to determine whether UtList_Destroy is actually reachable from higher-level call chains.\n\n- OS_Application_Run: caller of UtTest_Run (from the call graph). Include to continue the caller-chain toward program entry so you can decide if UtList_Destroy is reachable from program start (project-level unreachable code).\n\nThese symbols give the necessary type information, callees and caller-chain to decide if any statement in UtList_Destroy (including the loop body or the final free) can never be reached."
