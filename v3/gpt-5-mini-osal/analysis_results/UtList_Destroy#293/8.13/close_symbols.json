  "explanation": "UtListHead_t: needed to know the exact layout and types of members (in particular the type of Tags[] and whether NumberOfTags is mutable) so we can determine whether UtList_Destroy modifies the pointed-to object (writes into members) and therefore whether the parameter could be const-qualified. UtList_Reset: the function is called on &ListHead->Tags[i]; its prototype/definition is required to see whether it takes a pointer to non-const (i.e. it modifies the tag) or could accept a pointer-to-const, which directly affects whether UtList_Destroy could treat ListHead (or its Tags) as const. UtList_DeleteNode: UtList_Reset calls this; its definition helps confirm whether resetting a tag performs modifications (and of what parts of the structure), supporting the determination of whether the Tags and/or the containing UtListHead_t are mutated. free (stdlib): the signature free(void *) is relevant because UtList_Destroy calls free(ListHead); freeing via a non-const void* shows that the function releases (and therefore logically mutates/consumes) the pointed memory \u2014 if ListHead were const-qualified, freeing it would require casting away const. Knowing the exact prototype/semantics of free affirms that ListHead cannot sensibly be const in this function. Together these symbols let an analyzer decide if UtList_Destroy actually needs a non-const UtListHead_t* (and thus whether making it a pointer-to-const would violate program semantics or require const casts), which is the essence of the MISRA guidance on const qualification."
