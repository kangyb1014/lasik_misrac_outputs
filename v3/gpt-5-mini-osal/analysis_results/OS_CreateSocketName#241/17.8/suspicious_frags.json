  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned or otherwise modified in this function. The code only dereferences or passes the pointer parameters (token, Addr, parent_name) to other functions or uses them in expressions (e.g., *token in OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, Addr passed to OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl/OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl, parent_name used in snprintf). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted; only modifying the pointer parameter itself (reassigning token, Addr, or parent_name) would be a violation. There are no statements here that assign to token, Addr, or parent_name, so no fragments in this function require further investigation for Rule 17.8."
