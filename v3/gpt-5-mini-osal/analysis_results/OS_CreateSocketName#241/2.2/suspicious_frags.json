The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I did not mark other parts of OS_CreateSocketName or the helper functions because they perform actions that can affect the observable behavior depending on runtime inputs: the calls to OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl and OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl conditionally initialize or append to sock->stream_name, the assignments and snprintf calls change the buffer contents and thus program output, and the returned error codes and subsequent logic govern control flow. Those operations are therefore not obviously removable without changing behavior and are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2. The only obvious redundant fragments in the provided code are the 'break;' statements immediately following a 'return' in the switch default branches (they are unreachable and effectively extraneous), which merit investigation."
