  "explanation": "No language extensions are present in the provided function body. The code uses only standard C constructs and standard library features: local variable declarations, pointer dereferencing, structure member access, sizeof, snprintf, casts (unsigned int), and calls to functions/macros whose names begin with OS_. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs visible such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), inline assembly, wide-character/extended literal prefixes, or other known compiler extensions.\n\nNotes on potentially ambiguous items (do not require investigation based on the provided source):\n- The invocation of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro call; macros can hide non-portable code, but the macro definition is not present here. The rule requires reporting explicit uses of language extensions as stated in compiler documentation; a macro call alone is not an explicit language extension in this source fragment.\n- Calls to OS_SockAddrToString_Impl, OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl, and OS_strnlen are ordinary function calls; their implementations might use extensions, but those implementations are outside the submitted code and thus not reportable here.\n\nTherefore, based on the source shown, there are no suspicious code fragments that use compiler language extensions and require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
