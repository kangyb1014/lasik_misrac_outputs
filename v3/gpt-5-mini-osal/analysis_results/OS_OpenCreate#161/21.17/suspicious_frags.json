  "explanation": "Only fragments that allocate a char buffer or pass string pointers/buffers to other routines are flagged because MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions that may access beyond object bounds. The following lines are not investigated: - Parameter checks, access_mode comparisons, assignments, and object allocation/finalization calls (e.g. OS_CHECK_POINTER, access_mode if-statement, *filedes = ..., OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew) do not themselves perform string handling and so are not directly relevant. - Calls that do not pass string buffers or pointers (e.g. OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, stream initialization other than the OS_OBJECT_INIT macro) are not included. The flagged fragments are where a path string is copied/relayed into a local buffer or into internal record fields (local_path declaration, OS_TranslatePath writing into local_path, OS_OBJECT_INIT storing path into stream_name, and passing local_path to OS_FileOpen_Impl) and therefore require inspection to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses by string.h functions occur."
