  "explanation": "No code in the provided fragments invokes any of the string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext only performs integer/index arithmetic, a bounds comparison (iter->token.obj_idx >= iter->limit), and an array access via the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET which expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]. The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx, and OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED is just an initializer. Because Rule 21.17 applies specifically to uses of the string.h functions, there are no fragments here that fall under that rule and therefore nothing to report for investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: potential array-index/bounds concerns are a different class of MISRA checks and are outside the narrow scope of Rule 21.17.)"
