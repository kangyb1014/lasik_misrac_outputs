  "explanation": "The only controlling expression in the function is the do-while condition 'while (!got_next)'. That controlling expression and the initializer of the controlling flag (got_next = false) are the pieces that can make the loop controlling expression invariant and therefore need investigation. Other conditional expressions do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the 'if (iter->token.obj_idx >= iter->limit)' test is dependent on the incremented iter->token.obj_idx so it is not invariant; the 'if (iter->match == NULL || iter->match(...))' test depends on the function pointer, its argument and the record returned by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, so it is not invariant; the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET ultimately indexes using token->obj_idx, which is modified in the loop; assignments such as iter->token.obj_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED and iter->token.obj_id = record->active_id are not controlling expressions. Therefore those other fragments do not meet the criteria for Rule 14.3 investigation."
