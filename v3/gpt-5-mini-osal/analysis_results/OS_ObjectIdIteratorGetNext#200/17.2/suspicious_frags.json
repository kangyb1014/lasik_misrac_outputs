  "explanation": "I inspected OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext and identified only the function-like operations as potential sources of indirect recursion: the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET invocation and the call through the iter->match function pointer. All other lines in the function are simple assignments, control-flow (do/while, break), an increment (++iter->token.obj_idx), or a return; these cannot by themselves introduce direct or indirect recursive calls and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2. The provided inline helper (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) is not invoked by OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, so it cannot contribute to an indirect recursion path originating from this function and does not need to be investigated in this context."
