  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition, pointer types, typedef-like identifiers (UtListHead_t, UtListNode_t, uint32) and NULL. The identifiers ending with _t and the name uint32 are user/project typedefs (or could come from a standard header) \u2014 they are not compiler extensions. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ...; }) as an expression, nested functions, label-as-value, computed goto, inline asm, pragma directives, or other vendor-specific tokens. No assembly, no vendor-specific keywords, and no use of nonstandard literal suffixes or storage-class specifiers are present. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
