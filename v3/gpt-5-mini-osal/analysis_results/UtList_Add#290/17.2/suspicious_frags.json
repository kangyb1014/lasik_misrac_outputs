  "suspicious_frags": [
    "UtList_Insert_Before(TagHead, NewNode);",
    "TagHead = UtList_GetHead(ListHead, Tag);",
    "NewNode      = UtList_NewNode(Data, DataSize);"
  ],
  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function body. There is no direct call to UtList_Add itself, so no direct recursion. The only places that could introduce indirect recursion are calls to other functions that might call back into UtList_Add; therefore the three function-call statements to UtList_GetHead, UtList_NewNode and UtList_Insert_Before should be investigated. Other fragments (variable declarations, the if (TagHead != NULL) check, the assignment NewNode->Tag = Tag, and the control flow/braces) are simple operations that cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
