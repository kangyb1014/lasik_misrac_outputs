  "explanation": "Only pointer-bearing code fragments are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The listed fragments include all occurrences of pointer types and pointer uses in the provided function and therefore should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types can be const-qualified. Other parts of the function were not reported because they do not involve pointer types (e.g., the non-pointer parameters DataSize and Tag, the assignment to NewNode->Tag, and the function return type void) and thus are not relevant to Rule 8.13. No additional pointer occurrences are present in the supplied code, so nothing else needs investigation for this rule."
