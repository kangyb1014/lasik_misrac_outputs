  "explanation": "I found one controlling expression: if (TagHead != NULL). TagHead is assigned from the call UtList_GetHead(ListHead, Tag), so the condition depends on a function return value at runtime and is not a compile-time invariant. There are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) or other controlling expressions in this function that could be constant/invariant. Assignments such as NewNode->Tag = Tag and the call UtList_Insert_Before(...) are not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for Rule 14.3."
