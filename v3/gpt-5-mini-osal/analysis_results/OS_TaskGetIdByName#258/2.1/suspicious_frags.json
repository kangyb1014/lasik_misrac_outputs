  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for unreachable-code concerns. The function signature, the local variable declaration (int32 return_code;), comments, and the surrounding braces do not introduce control-flow that would make code unreachable. There is no code following an obviously unconditional return or an infinite loop in this snippet, nor are there labels or conditional compilation directives that would create unreachable regions. The only parts that could affect reachability (and therefore merit inspection) are the macro invocations and the statements that follow them, which have been listed above."
