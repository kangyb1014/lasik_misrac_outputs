  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. In OS_TaskGetIdByName there are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like task_id = ... or task_name = ...), so the pointer parameters themselves are not modified. Passing task_id to OS_ObjectIdFindByName is permitted because the rule allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter (and OS_ObjectIdFindByName assigns via *object_id = token.obj_id, which modifies the pointee, not the pointer). The task_name parameter is const and is not modified anywhere (ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK only inspect it). The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro only checks for NULL and does not alter the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
