  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The increment itself does not call any <string.h> functions and is safe given the prior computation of ActualCopy (ActualCopy is set to the remaining bytes: TotalSize - Position, then possibly limited by MaxSize), so updating Position by ActualCopy cannot on its own cause a string.h call to access outside the buffer. However, a violation can occur if the invariant Position <= TotalSize is not guaranteed: if StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position > StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize prior to computing ActualCopy, the subtraction (TotalSize - Position) will underflow (size_t wrap), producing a very large ActualCopy and leading the subsequent memcpy to read beyond the buffer bounds. Thus no rule violation if Position<=TotalSize is ensured; otherwise Rule 21.17 can be violated."
