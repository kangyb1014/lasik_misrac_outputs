  "explanation": "The only Standard Library string handling call in this function is memcpy; therefore investigation should focus on code that determines the source pointer, the destination pointer length, and the copy size. The other fragments in the function are simple local declarations/initializations (size_t ActualCopy = 0; UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;), the retrieval and NULL check of the stub entry (StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(...); if (StubPtr != NULL) { ... }), the call to UT_ClearStubEntry(...), comments, and the return of ActualCopy. These do not themselves perform string.h operations or arithmetic that affects the memcpy parameters beyond the listed fragments, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 compliance."
