  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned within OS_SocketAccept_Impl. Specifically:\n- sock_token and conn_token are only dereferenced via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *sock_token) and similar; this reads the object token value and does not assign to the pointer parameter itself.\n- sock_token and conn_token are passed to other functions/macros (OS_SelectSingle_Impl, OS_IMPL_SET_SOCKET_FLAGS) but there is no assignment to the parameter variables in this function. Calling another function with a pointer parameter is permitted; the rule only forbids modifying the parameter variable (the pointer) itself.\n- Addr is used to read and write its pointed-to members (addrlen = Addr->ActualLength; Addr->ActualLength = addrlen; and passing &Addr->AddrData). Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule; there is no assignment to the Addr pointer itself (no \"Addr = ...\"), so this is compliant.\n- timeout (an integer parameter) is only passed through; it is not assigned to or modified.\n- The accept call assigns to conn_impl->fd and uses Addr members; these modify underlying objects, not the pointer parameters.\n- The additional helper OS_SetSocketDefaultFlags_Impl similarly dereferences the token to index the table and modifies fields of the retrieved impl record (impl->selectable), but does not assign to the token parameter itself.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (no pointer parameter variables are modified). If any of the used macros/functions (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_IMPL_SET_SOCKET_FLAGS, or OS_SelectSingle_Impl) contain code that assigns to their pointer-parameter variables, those macro/function definitions should be inspected; however, based on their usage here they operate on the objects referred to by the tokens rather than reassigning the token parameters themselves."
