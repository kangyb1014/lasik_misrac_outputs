Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DirCreate_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_DirCreate_Impl(const char *local_path, uint32 access)\n{\n    struct stat st;\n    int32       return_code;\n\n    if (mkdir(local_path, S_IFDIR | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) < 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n\n        if (errno == EEXIST)\n        {\n            /* Success if already exists and is a directory */\n            if (stat(local_path, &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode))\n            {\n                return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DirCreate_Impl:\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (mkdir(local_path, S_IFDIR | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) < 0)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation. The mkdir() call has observable side effects (creates a directory and/or sets errno); removing this operation would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
