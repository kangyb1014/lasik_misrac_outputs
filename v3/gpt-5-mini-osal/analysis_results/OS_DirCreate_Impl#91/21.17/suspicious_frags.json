  "explanation": "No other parts of the provided code contain direct calls to the <string.h> library functions listed by MISRA C Rule 21.17. The typedefs, macro definitions (OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS), permission flags (S_IFDIR, S_IRWX*), errno checks, struct stat usage, and simple return-code logic do not invoke memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. The only locations that could involve string-handling operations (and thus should be investigated) are the OS_TranslatePath call that copies/translates the input path into a fixed-size local buffer and the code that subsequently passes that buffer to filesystem calls; those fragments are included above for investigation."
