  "explanation": "Both function parameters have been checked: local_path is declared as const char * and is only used as an argument to mkdir() and stat() (both take const char *), and it is never assigned to or otherwise modified in the function. The access parameter (uint32 access) is not used and is also not modified. No pointer parameter is reassigned and no object referred to by a pointer parameter is modified here, so there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
