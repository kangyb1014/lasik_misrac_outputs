  "explanation": "- OS_mkdir: Direct caller of OS_DirCreate_Impl (per the static graph). To determine whether there is indirect recursion you must inspect OS_mkdir's implementation to see if it (directly or via other callees) calls back into OS_DirCreate_Impl or into any function that eventually calls OS_DirCreate_Impl.\n- OS_TranslatePath: Listed as a callee of OS_mkdir in the static graph. Any callee of OS_mkdir could participate in a call cycle back to OS_DirCreate_Impl, so its body must be checked.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These are also listed as OS_mkdir callees in the static graph. Although they look like test harness/stub helpers, they must be inspected to ensure they do not (now or in future/test builds) call OS_DirCreate_Impl or otherwise introduce a cycle.\n- mkdir, stat: The target function calls these names. In order to be certain there is no indirect recursion through name aliasing or wrapper functions in the codebase (for example, a project-local mkdir wrapper that delegates to OS_mkdir), confirm the actual implementations or linkage of mkdir and stat to ensure they are plain libc functions and do not call back into OS_* functions.\n\nInclude the above symbols (and their implementations) in the next-agent prompt so it can trace the call graph fully and determine whether OS_DirCreate_Impl participates in any direct or indirect self-call cycle (MISRA: no direct or indirect recursion)."
