  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you need the following additional symbols and why:\n\n- mkdir\n  - The function calls mkdir. To know whether any string comparison (particularly memcmp on NUL-terminated paths) occurs inside this call you must inspect its implementation or wrapper.\n\n- stat\n  - The function calls stat. Inspecting stat's implementation ensures it does not perform forbidden memcmp-on-string usage on the pathname argument or other internal NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- struct stat (st_mode)\n  - The code uses a struct stat instance and tests its st_mode via S_ISDIR; the struct layout is required to confirm S_ISDIR usage is only bit tests (not string comparisons).\n\n- S_ISDIR\n  - This macro determines whether the returned mode indicates a directory. You must confirm it is a bit-test macro (no string comparisons) and thus cannot hide memcmp usage.\n\n- errno\n  - errno is read to check EEXIST; you must confirm no hidden string comparisons are performed when querying or setting errno in the used environment.\n\n- EEXIST\n  - The specific error constant compared against errno; included to inspect any related macros or wrappers that might perform string ops.\n\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO\n  - These file-mode constants are used in the mkdir call flags. Confirming their definitions (macros/constants) shows they are just constants and not wrappers that could invoke memcmp.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS\n  - Return-code constants used by the function; inspect their definitions to ensure they are simple constants (no hidden functions/macros that could use memcmp).\n\n- int32, uint32\n  - Type definitions used in the signature; ensure their typedefs are straightforward and not implemented via macros that might include string comparisons.\n\n- memcmp\n  - The rule of interest references memcmp. You must inspect the memcmp symbol itself and search call chains from mkdir/stat (and any macros above) to memcmp to determine whether any code reachable from this function performs memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementations/definitions of the system calls and macros the function uses (mkdir, stat, S_ISDIR and the constants/macros) plus the memcmp symbol so you can detect any direct or transitive uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Also confirm that the error/status macros/types (errno, EEXIST, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, int32/uint32) are simple definitions and do not hide string comparisons."
