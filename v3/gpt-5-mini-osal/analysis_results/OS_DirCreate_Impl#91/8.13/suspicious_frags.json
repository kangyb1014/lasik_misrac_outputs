  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer uses found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter local_path is already declared as const char *, satisfying the rule. The only other pointer usage is the address of a local struct stat passed to stat(), which must be a modifiable struct stat * because the stat() call populates that structure (so it cannot be const). The POSIX calls used (mkdir, stat) expect a const char * for the path and a non-const struct stat * for the output; therefore no pointer in this function can or should be further const-qualified. No other pointer variables or parameters exist that would need investigation under Rule 8.13."
