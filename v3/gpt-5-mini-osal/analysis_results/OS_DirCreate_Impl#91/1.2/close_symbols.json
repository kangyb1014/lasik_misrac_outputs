  "explanation": "For checking whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions (per the MISRA rule), the next analyser must be able to inspect the actual definitions/expansions and declarations of each symbol that could hide an extension. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- int32, uint32: These are typedefs (not standard C keywords). Their underlying definitions must be inspected to ensure they are not implemented using compiler extensions/attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __int64, compiler-specific builtin types, or nonstandard typedefs).\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: Likely macros or enum constants. Their definitions might use extensions (complex macro tricks, GCC attributes, or compiler pragmas). Need to see the exact definitions.\n\n- mkdir: The name could be a function or a macro wrapper. The implementation/declaration could use platform-specific or compiler-specific extensions (inline, asm, attributes, or macro-based wrappers). Inspect the prototype/implementation to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- stat, struct stat: The struct definition and the stat function prototype come from system headers. These definitions may contain implementation-defined or extension constructs (e.g. bitfields, packed attributes, type aliases). The analyzer must examine struct stat and stat declaration for extension usage.\n\n- S_ISDIR: This is a macro used to test the file type. Macros can hide compiler extensions (e.g. use of typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), or other nonstandard constructs). The macro expansion must be checked.\n\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO: These are constant macros for mode bits. Although normally plain integer macros, implementations could use nonstandard constructs or rely on implementation-specific headers that use extensions. Check their definitions to be safe.\n\n- errno, EEXIST: errno is often a macro expanding to an lvalue or function call (e.g. __errno_location()) which may use compiler-specific constructs. EEXIST is a macro constant; its definition should also be checked.\n\nIn short: inspect the typedefs, macros, and function/struct declarations used by the function because any of them might be implemented via compiler-specific language extensions. The above symbols are the minimal set whose definitions/expansions must be available to determine compliance with the \"no language extensions\" MISRA constraint."
