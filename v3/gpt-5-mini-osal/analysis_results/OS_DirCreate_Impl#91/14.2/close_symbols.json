Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required for MISRA C for-loop analysis of OS_DirCreate_Impl:\n\n- mkdir\n  - The function calls mkdir; MISRA rule text requires the behaviour of any functions called within the loop body to be considered. Even though OS_DirCreate_Impl contains no for-loop, to prove it cannot violate the rule through called functions we must inspect mkdir implementation (or a model/stub) for any for-loops or side-effects that could interact with loop counters.\n\n- stat\n  - Similarly, OS_DirCreate_Impl calls stat. Its implementation must be examined for interior for-loops or modifications of objects that could affect loop well-formedness if a for-loop were present or injected via inlined code.\n\n- errno\n  - errno is read in a conditional (errno == EEXIST). Any analysis of side-effects and object modification must account for errno being a modifiable global; if a for-loop existed and used or modified errno, that could violate the rule. Also follow how errno is defined (macro or lvalue).\n\n- EEXIST\n  - The constant compared to errno; include to know whether it is a macro or expression expanding to something with side-effects (normally it is a simple macro/enum). Confirming it has no side-effects is necessary for clause-2 checks.\n\n- S_ISDIR\n  - Macro used to test st.st_mode. Must confirm it expands to a simple expression that does not introduce side-effects or additional variables (relevant if similar macros were used in loop clauses).\n\n- struct stat (st, st_mode)\n  - The structure and the st_mode member are accessed. If any for-loop analysis requires checking modification of objects used in loop clauses, we must know whether st or st_mode aliases other objects or are modified elsewhere.\n\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO\n  - Mode constants passed to mkdir. Ensure these are simple constants/macros with no side-effects; relevant to clause-1/3 checks which require no unexpected modifications in expressions used with loop counters.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS\n  - Returned values from the function. While not directly related to for-loops, include them to determine whether any return paths (including via called functions) can result from loop behavior inside called functions; also to ensure they are simple constants.\n\n- int32, uint32\n  - The integer typedefs used in the signature. Their signedness/width and whether they are macros or typedefs matters if loop counters in surrounding code are of these types and for reasoning about loop-counter modifications or promotions.\n\n- const char *local_path\n  - The parameter object that is passed to mkdir/stat. If any for-loop (in this function or in called functions) used or modified this object, it would be relevant to clause-2/3 (objects modified in loop body must not appear in loop clauses). Include to verify no hidden modifications.\n\nNotes/assumptions:\n- OS_DirCreate_Impl itself contains no for-loops. The primary additional artifacts required for a complete MISRA for-loop check are the implementations (or authoritative stubs/specifications) of the called functions (mkdir and stat) and the definitions of the macros/constants and global objects used, to confirm none introduce for-loops or side-effects that could interact with loop counters per the MISRA rule.\n- Caller functions (e.g., OS_mkdir) are not required unless you also need to check for-loops that appear when this function is inlined into its callers; the MISRA rule applies to each for statement, and only the behaviour of functions called within that statement must be considered."
