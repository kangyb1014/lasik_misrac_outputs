  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are syntactically invariant. All conditional statements use the variable return_code, which is assigned at runtime by function calls (e.g. OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken), so the expressions (e.g. if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)) are not constant at compile time and are not guaranteed to always evaluate the same way. There are no while/for/do-while loops with constant conditions, no switch on constant expressions, and no other control statements with literal or compile-time constant controlling expressions. The macro OS_SUCCESS is a constant (0) but it is being compared to runtime values, which does not make the controlling expressions invariant. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
