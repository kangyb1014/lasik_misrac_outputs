  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that could be to const-qualified types. The only places in this function that create pointers to a non-const object are the local token variable and the two call sites that pass its address (&token). Other lines do not involve pointers (sem_id and msecs are passed by value; return_code is a scalar; the function signature and return statement do not introduce pointer parameters) and thus do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
