  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n- The function parameter BufferPtr is declared as const void * which satisfies the rule (source pointer is const-qualified where appropriate).\n- The local pointer StubPtr is used to modify the stub table entry (memcpy destination and write to Position). Therefore it must be a pointer to a non-const UT_StubTableEntry_t and should not be const-qualified.\n- The destination used in memcpy (StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr) must be a non-const pointer because it is written to; making it point to a const-qualified type would be incorrect.\n- The call to memcpy uses BufferPtr (const void *) as the source parameter, matching memcpy\u2019s prototype (const void *src).\n- There are no other pointer declarations or uses in the provided fragment that could be made const without preventing required modifications.\n\nGiven these facts, there are no pointer declarations in the shown code that violate or appear to violate Rule 8.13, so no code fragments require further investigation for this rule."
