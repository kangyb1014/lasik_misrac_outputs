  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the presented code fragment. Everything in the function is standard C: the function definition, pointer and size_t usage, NULL checks, structure member access, calls to UtAssert_Abort and memcpy, and simple assignments and comparisons are all valid standard C constructs. The provided typedef line (typedef cpuaddr UT_EntryKey_t) does introduce an unfamiliar identifier cpuaddr, but that alone is not necessarily a language extension \u2014 it is most likely a platform-specific typedef defined elsewhere. Because the rule requires reporting only explicit compiler language extensions (e.g., GCC/Clang __attribute__, __builtin_..., typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, asm, Microsoft __declspec, etc.), and none of those or any other documented compiler-specific keywords or constructs appear in the supplied code, there are no fragments to flag for investigation."
