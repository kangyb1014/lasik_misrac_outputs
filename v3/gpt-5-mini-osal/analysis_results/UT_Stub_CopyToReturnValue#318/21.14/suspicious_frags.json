  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided function. The rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings; this function only calls memcpy to copy a buffer (not to compare), and it treats the data as a binary buffer (BufferPtr is const void* and sizes are explicitly checked). There are no string comparison APIs (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) or any code that appears to use memcmp for comparing null\u2011terminated strings, so there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
