  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined all code in the target function and the related definitions for constructs that would constitute compiler/language extensions (examples: GNU __attribute__ or __extension__ tokens, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly (__asm__), nonstandard pragmas, compiler builtins with compiler-specific names, or other documented compiler-only keywords). None of these appear.\n\nSpecific observations that justify not reporting fragments:\n- The use of pthread_cancel, pthread_join, strerror and pthread types are POSIX library calls, not compiler language extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) expands to standard C expressions and uses the address-of operator on an expression; this is standard C and not a language extension.\n- The typedef for a function-pointer type and use of function-pointer variables (delete_hook) are standard C.\n- The static inline helper (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) uses the inline keyword, which is part of standard C (since C99), not a compiler extension.\n- There are no occurrences of identifiers or tokens that are commonly compiler-specific (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, labels-as-values, statement-expressions, or other known extensions).\n\nBased on the provided code, there are no fragments that explicitly use compiler-documented language extensions, so nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
