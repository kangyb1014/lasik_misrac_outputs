  "explanation": "The only function parameter of OS_TaskDelete is 'task_id'. In the body there is no assignment to task_id, no use of the address-of operator (&task_id), and task_id is passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById, so it cannot be modified by that call. Other pointers passed to functions (e.g., &token) refer to a local variable (token), not to a function parameter, so any modifications via those pointers would not violate Rule 17.8. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the calls OS_TaskDelete_Impl(&token) and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(return_code, &token) operate on the local token, not on a parameter. The delete_hook usage and the delete_hook() call do not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that appear to modify a function parameter and none that need further investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
