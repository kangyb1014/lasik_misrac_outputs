  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function body and found no use of any compiler-specific language extensions. The code consists of a standard C function definition, pointer and NULL comparisons, function calls, and a comment. The identifiers (UT_EntryKey_t, UT_HandlerFunc_t, UT_GetStubEntry, UT_SetHandlerFunction, UT_DefaultStubImpl) are user-defined types and functions but do not themselves indicate a language extension in this snippet. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC/Clang-specific keywords, pragmas, or other nonstandard constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
