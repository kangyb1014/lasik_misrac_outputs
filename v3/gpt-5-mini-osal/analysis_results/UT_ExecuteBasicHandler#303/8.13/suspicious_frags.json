  "explanation": "The FunctionName parameter is already declared as const char * and therefore does not need further investigation for Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer variables or pointer declarations in the body beyond the shown calls and parameters. The listed fragments cover all places in this function where pointer types are used or passed (the function-pointer parameter, the return value of UT_GetStubEntry, and the calls that pass pointer arguments/NULL), so other code in this function does not present additional potential violations of Rule 8.13."
