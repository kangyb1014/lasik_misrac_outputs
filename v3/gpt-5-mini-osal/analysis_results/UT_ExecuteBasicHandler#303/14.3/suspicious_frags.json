  "explanation": "No loops or invariant controlling expressions are present that would trigger Rule 14.3. The only conditional is:\nif (UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_FINAL_HANDLER) == NULL && DefaultHandler != NULL)\nThis depends on a runtime function call (UT_GetStubEntry) and a function parameter (DefaultHandler) so it is not an invariant constant expression. There are no for/while/do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions; the do-while exception is not applicable. The literal 0 passed to UT_DefaultStubImpl is an argument, not a controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
