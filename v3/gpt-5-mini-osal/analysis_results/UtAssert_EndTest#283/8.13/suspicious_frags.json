  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not create or pass pointers that could/should be const-qualified: - Variable declarations and scalar updates (Ct, SegmentValid, UT_TotalCounters.*, UT_SegmentCounters.* assignments, ++UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount) operate on non-pointer types or intentionally modify globals, so the pointed-to data cannot be const. - UT_BSP_Lock() and UT_BSP_Unlock() are calls without pointer arguments and thus not relevant to pointer const-qualification. - The for loop and arithmetic on CaseCount entries modify state (not pointer-related const issues). - memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters)); is zeroing a mutable object (destination must be non-const). - The Local_SegmentName declaration and sizeof(CurrentSegment) use array sizing, not pointer typing. The four listed call/use sites are the only locations in this function where non-const pointers or pointer arguments are passed in contexts that should be reviewed to determine whether const qualification is possible or appropriate."
