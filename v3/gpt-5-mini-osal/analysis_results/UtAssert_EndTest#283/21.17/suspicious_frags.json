  "explanation": "All other parts of the function do not invoke string.h routines and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The for-loop uses Ct with the condition Ct < UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX which matches the dimension used for CaseCount[], so those array accesses should be bounded. Other statements are simple integer increments/assignments, function calls (UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, UT_BSP_*), or use of locally-sized fixed buffers; none call standard string handling functions that can cause out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore only the listed calls to memcpy, memset, strcpy, and strncpy require further investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17."
