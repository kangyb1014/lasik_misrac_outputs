  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of UtAssert_EndTest:\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters\n  - This global structure is read, copied, and cleared by UtAssert_EndTest. To know whether the operations (reading TotalTestCases, copying CaseCount array, memset to zero) have observable effect elsewhere, we must know its type, layout, and all other locations that read/modify it.\n\n- UT_TotalCounters\n  - UtAssert_EndTest updates UT_TotalCounters (TestSegmentCount, TotalTestCases, CaseCount[]). Determining whether those assignments are necessary (i.e., removing them would change program behaviour) requires knowledge of where UT_TotalCounters is used elsewhere.\n\n- CurrentSegment\n  - The function copies CurrentSegment into a local buffer and later passes that name to the report routine. To judge whether the strcpy/memory copy is required (or redundant/dead), the definition, size, and any other writers/readers of CurrentSegment must be known (and whether it is ever non-empty).\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX\n  - Drives the loop bounds that accumulate CaseCount[]. If this constant is zero or otherwise fixed such that the loop never executes, the loop body could be dead. You need its definition to determine if the loop executes.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_END\n  - Used as the first argument to UT_BSP_DoText in the else branch. To decide whether that call is a meaningful observable action (thus not dead), you need the semantic meaning of this constant (e.g., whether UT_BSP_DoText treats it specially).\n\n- UtAssert_TestCounter_t\n  - The type of Local_SegmentCounters/UT_SegmentCounters determines the size copied/cleared and whether the memcpy/memset are necessary and correctly aligned. Also needed to see if any padding/unused fields could make some assignments no-ops.\n\n- UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport\n  - The function called when SegmentValid is true. To decide whether preparing Local_SegmentName and Local_SegmentCounters prior to this call is necessary (i.e., removing those preparations would change behaviour), the report routine implementation and which fields it reads must be known.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - Called when SegmentValid is false (and also from other callees). Removing the UT_BSP_DoText call or related preparation could change external observable behaviour (console output). You must know whether UT_BSP_DoText has side effects relevant to system behaviour.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - Called unconditionally at start/end. Lock/unlock have timing and concurrency side effects; to decide whether these calls are removable (dead) you need their semantics/implementation (they may affect interrupts, concurrency, or timing).\n\n- UtAssert_BeginTest\n  - This function is a likely producer of UT_SegmentCounters/CurrentSegment state (from the static graph and typical naming). To determine if the SegmentValid branch in EndTest can ever be true and thus whether code is exercised/required, you need to inspect begin-test behavior.\n\n- UtAssert_GetCounters\n  - Any other routines that read the counters influence whether the writes here are observable. UtAssert_GetCounters is listed in the call graph as interacting with counters; include it to see whether the values written by EndTest are used.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl and OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl\n  - These are the underlying implementations invoked by UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock. To fully assess lock/unlock side effects (timing, critical sections, blocking), include these OS-level implementations.\n\nNotes on exclusions/assumptions:\n- Standard library routines used (memcpy, strcpy, memset) have well-known semantics; you only need the type/size information above to judge whether their use is meaningful. The listed symbols focus on globals, macros, types, and functions whose semantics determine whether the assignments/calls in UtAssert_EndTest are observable (and therefore not dead) or can be removed without effect."
