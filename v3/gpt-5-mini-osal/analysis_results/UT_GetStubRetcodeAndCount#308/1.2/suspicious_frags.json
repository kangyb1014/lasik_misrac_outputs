  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. The constructs used are standard C: function definitions and returns, pointers, structs, typedefs, fixed-width integer types (int32_t), standard arithmetic and control flow (if/else, while, break), increment/decrement, array indexing, and pointer dereference. The use of bool can be implemented as the standard C _Bool / stdbool.h and is not an extension by itself. The identifier cpuaddr appears as a typedef target (typedef cpuaddr UT_EntryKey_t) but this is a type alias declared elsewhere; the snippet does not show any compiler-specific builtin or extension (for example: __asm__, __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, pragma extensions, inline assembler, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or compiler-specific keywords). Because cpuaddr\u2019s underlying definition is not shown, it is not evidence of a language extension in the presented code \u2014 it may be a project-defined typedef. Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
