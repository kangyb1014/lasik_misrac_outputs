  "explanation": "No recursive calls are present in the provided code. The only call in UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount is to UT_GetStubEntry. UT_GetStubEntry contains no function calls (it only accesses global/static data, performs arithmetic and loop control) and therefore cannot call back into UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount or any other function \u2014 there is no direct or indirect call chain that would form recursion. UT_GetStubEntry is also declared static (internal linkage), so there are no external calls shown that could create an indirect recursion with the provided fragments. Consequently, there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
