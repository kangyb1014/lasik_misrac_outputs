  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The only control construct is the switch(CompareType) where CompareType is a function parameter (not a compile-time or constant invariant), so Rule 14.3 does not appear to be violated. There are no while/for/do-while loops or if statements with constant controlling expressions; case labels are constant by language requirement but are not \"controlling expressions\". Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 14.3 in this function."
