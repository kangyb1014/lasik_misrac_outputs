The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The listed case bodies (including the default) are assignments and breaks that could be dead if certain CompareType values are never passed at runtime or if the enumeration covers all possible values making some branches unreachable/redundant. These fragments should be investigated to determine whether their removal would or would not affect program behaviour.\n\nFragments not listed that do not need investigation: the function signature, the declaration 'const char *OpText;', the 'switch (CompareType)' line, the enclosing braces, and the final 'return OpText;' statement \u2014 these are structurally required for the function to operate and are not candidates for dead code on their own. Comments and break statements outside the case assignment context are not themselves dead code. Unreachable code differs from dead code per MISRA notes; investigation should focus on whether the listed assignments/branches are actually unnecessary for program behaviour."
