  "explanation": "For deciding whether any executed operation in OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl is dead code (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyser must know the following: \n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor and reads sa.sa_family and the embedded sin_addr/sin6_addr members. You must know the accessor layout to determine whether the assignment to addrbuffer and subsequent dereferences are meaningful or can be optimized away.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: definition (and in particular the AddrData member) is required to determine how callers construct addresses, whether the cast is valid, and whether Addr can be NULL or otherwise constrained by API invariants.\n\n- AddrData (field of OS_SockAddr_t): explicit knowledge of this field is needed to see what data is actually carried and whether the accessor cast always maps to relevant bytes \u2014 this affects whether the switch and addrbuffer assignment are ever effective.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: the switch is on sa_family; you must know the possible values and their meaning to decide which switch cases are reachable and whether a case could be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: the AF_INET6 case is conditionally compiled. You must know whether this macro is defined in the build(s) of interest to determine if that code is even present and therefore whether it can be considered dead/unused in the project configuration.\n\n- inet_ntop: its prototype and runtime semantics (returning NULL on failure, and how it uses the addrbuffer/family arguments) are required to judge whether the call and its error-handling path (returning OS_ERROR) are necessary; if inet_ntop can never fail for the provided inputs, an error path might be dead, otherwise not.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: the return-code values used by the function. You need their definitions (and intended semantics) to determine whether removing particular return statements would alter observable behaviour and how callers react to those return codes.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrToString (caller wrapper): examine how this wrapper invokes the Impl function (including any preconditions it enforces, e.g. non-NULL buffer/Addr, allowed families). If the wrapper guarantees certain conditions, some branches in the Impl may never be executed and could be dead.\n\n- OS_CreateSocketName (caller): listed as a direct caller in the static graph. You must inspect how it builds/passes OS_SockAddr_t instances (which families it can supply, whether AF_INET6 is ever used) to determine reachability of cases inside the Impl.\n\n- OS_SocketBindAddress and OS_SocketAccept: these are callers of OS_CreateSocketName (transitively related). They are included so the analyser can trace actual call sites and usage patterns (e.g. whether only IPv4 paths are ever constructed at higher levels), which impacts whether code handling IPv6 or certain error paths is ever executed in the overall project.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser determine which branches/assignments are ever executed in real builds and whether any executed operation can be removed without changing program behaviour (the MISRA dead-code criterion). Note: unreachable code (e.g. the break after a return) is a different category and must be identified separately; the above symbols are intended to evaluate executed-but-redundant code across the project and build configurations."
