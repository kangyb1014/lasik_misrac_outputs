  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about unreachable code you need symbols that let you determine which statements can actually be reached and whether any statements are provably unreachable:\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (preprocessor macro): Determines whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in. If the whole AF_INET6 case is excluded by this macro it affects which switch arms exist and therefore reachability of code following the switch.\n\n- AF_INET (constant): Needed to know which values the switch explicitly handles. Also to understand whether sa_family can ever take values not covered by cases.\n\n- AF_INET6 (constant): Same reason as AF_INET; required if IPv6 support is enabled to know the set of handled family values.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (typedef/struct): The target function casts Addr->AddrData to an accessor type. You need the original sockaddr representation to know whether the cast and subsequent member accesses are valid and whether sa_family is constrained by the surrounding code/data model (affects reachability of default case).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (typedef/struct): Contains the sa, sa_in, sa_in6 members used in the switch and inet_ntop call. Its definition is required to verify that Accessor->sa.sa_family is a real discriminant and to see any annotations or attributes that might constrain possible values (affects if default case can ever occur).\n\n- sa_family_t / Accessor->sa.sa_family declaration (type and possible domain): To reason about the domain/range of family values (e.g. an enum or constrained type) and whether any values beyond the listed cases are possible; this is necessary to determine whether the default branch is reachable or dead code.\n\n- inet_ntop (prototype/behavior): The call introduces another return path (NULL -> OS_ERROR). Knowing its prototype and whether it can be a macro or annotated in a way that affects control flow is necessary to ensure no hidden unreachable statements exist around its use.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS (return-code macros): These are the return expressions used in the function. Their definitions (macros/enum values) are needed to confirm they are simple returns (not macros that expand to additional statements) and to ensure that statements appearing after those returns (for example the 'break;' after 'return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;') are indeed unreachable syntactically rather than resulting from macro expansion.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine which switch arms are actually present after preprocessing, what values sa_family can take, and whether any statements (for example the 'break;' after a return) are provably unreachable or possibly produced/removed by macros \u2014 which is required to assess a violation of the MISRA \"no unreachable code\" rule."
