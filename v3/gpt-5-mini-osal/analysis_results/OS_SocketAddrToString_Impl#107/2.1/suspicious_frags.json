  "explanation": "The only unreachable code in this function is the `break;` immediately following `return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;` in the default switch arm \u2014 execution cannot reach the break after a return. Other fragments are not suspicious for reachability: the case arms assign addrbuffer and use break to exit the switch (these breaks are reachable), the AF_INET6 case is conditionally compiled and therefore not present when the macro is undefined (not unreachable in compiled code), and the subsequent calls to inet_ntop and the final return are reachable for the covered switch outcomes. No other statements in this function are statically unreachable."
