  "explanation": "For determining whether this function (or anything it calls) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- inet_ntop: the target function calls inet_ntop. You must inspect its prototype and (if available) implementation to see whether it or any wrappers it uses call memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: the rule concerns this function specifically. You need its definition/usage sites (including possible wrappers) to determine if any memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated C strings in the call chain.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the code casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type. You need its definition to verify the exact member types accessed (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) and confirm whether the code is dealing with binary address structures or strings.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (and the AddrData member layout): to confirm how AddrData is stored and whether any field could be a NUL\u2011terminated string rather than binary address data.\n\n- struct in_addr and sin_addr: to show that sin_addr is a fixed-size binary IPv4 address field (not a NUL\u2011terminated string). If these are binary, any memcmp use on them would not violate the rule.\n\n- struct in6_addr and sin6_addr: same reason for IPv6 addresses \u2014 confirm these are fixed-length binary data, not C strings.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: to verify the code paths selected and ensure the addrbuffer points to the expected binary address field for each family.\n\n- INET_ADDRSTRLEN and INET6_ADDRSTRLEN: to know the expected presentation buffer sizes and to reason about whether inet_ntop could produce NUL\u2011terminated strings and whether any comparisons on those strings could occur downstream.\n\n- <arpa/inet.h> and <netinet/in.h>: headers that declare inet_ntop, in_addr/in6_addr, the address family macros and related constants \u2014 helpful for locating prototypes and standard behaviour/documentation.\n\nUsing these symbols the next agent can (1) confirm that addrbuffer points to binary address data (so memcmp would be used on non\u2011string binary buffers), (2) inspect inet_ntop (and any wrapper) to ensure it does not itself call memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings, and (3) search for any memcmp usage in the call chain or in related accessor/OS functions that might compare C strings \u2014 which is what the MISRA rule forbids."
