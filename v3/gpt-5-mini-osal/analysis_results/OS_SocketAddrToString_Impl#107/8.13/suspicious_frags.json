  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rationale:\n- buffer (char *buffer): must be writable because inet_ntop writes the textual address into it, so it must not be const.\n- Addr (const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr): parameter is already a pointer to const-qualified type, satisfying the rule.\n- Accessor (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor): declared as pointer-to-const and is derived from Addr; the cast preserves const-qualification, so this conforms.\n- addrbuffer (const void *addrbuffer): declared const and used as the source for inet_ntop (which expects a const void *), so this conforms.\n- Addresses taken (&Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr and &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr): these are assigned to addrbuffer (const void *), preserving constness and matching the inet_ntop prototype.\n- No other pointer variables are present.\nTherefore there are no places in this function where a pointer should be const-qualified but is not."
