  "explanation": "To determine whether pointers in OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl are correctly const-qualified (MISRA: pointers should point to const whenever possible) the analyzer needs the concrete types and declarations involved in the pointer expressions and the called function prototype:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: shows the exact declared type of Addr->AddrData (array type and qualifiers). Whether Addr->AddrData is declared with/without const affects if casting or taking its address discards or adds const qualification.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: shows the layout and types of sa, sa_in, sa_in6. The code casts &Addr->AddrData to const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t*. The accessor definition is required to see whether members referenced via the const pointer (e.g. sa_in.sin_addr) are implicitly treated as const and whether the code obtains pointers to non-const subobjects.\n\n- struct sockaddr (and sa_family type): required to understand Accessor->sa.sa_family type and to verify that switching on the family and subsequent member accesses are to the correct union/fields.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr: required because the code takes &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr and passes it (via addrbuffer) to inet_ntop. The exact type of sin_addr (and whether it contains plain integers vs arrays) determines whether the address of that field yields a pointer with an appropriate const qualification.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 and struct in6_addr: same reason as above for the AF_INET6 branch.\n\n- inet_ntop prototype: critical to check the constness of the source parameter (the second parameter). POSIX declares the source parameter as const void *src; if the platform's prototype were non-const, that would affect whether passing addrbuffer (declared const void *) matches and whether a const->non-const conversion occurs.\n\n- AF_INET / AF_INET6: included to confirm which members are selected for each family (helps map code paths to the correct member types)."
