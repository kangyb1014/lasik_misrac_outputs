  "explanation": "To decide whether the switch controlling expression Accessor->sa.sa_family is an invariant (a constant at compile time) or not, the analyzer needs the exact declarations/layouts and relevant compile-time macros:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (full definition, especially the AddrData member): shows what Addr->AddrData actually is (array, union, padding). If AddrData is e.g. a compile-time constant or an unusual definition this could affect whether the cast yields a variable runtime value.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (full definition: layout/union/struct that defines .sa, .sa_in, .sa_in6): the code casts &Addr->AddrData to this accessor; you must know the accessor layout to determine whether Accessor->sa.sa_family is a normal runtime field or something resolved at compile time or UB due to misaligned/invalid overlay.\n\n- struct sockaddr / sa_family member declaration (type and any const/volatile qualifiers): the exact type (e.g. sa_family_t, uint16_t) and qualifiers (const/volatile) determine whether the expression could be considered invariant by the compiler or constrained by qualifiers (volatile prevents assumptions of invariance).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6 definitions (members sin_port, sin6_port and their types): while these members are not the switch expression, their definitions confirm the accessor semantics and show whether the accessor is really overlaying standard sockaddr structures (relevance to correctness of the cast and run-time variability).\n\n- in_port_t typedef: used by sa_port; knowing its underlying type helps evaluate any integer-promotion/compile-time-constant issues (not directly the controlling expression but part of the same accessor type family).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6 macro/enum definitions: to know whether the case labels are compile-time constants (they almost always are) and whether any preprocessor/enum trickery exists that could affect the switch semantics.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 macro (whether defined at compile time): controls whether the AF_INET6 case is present. Presence/absence may affect static analysis reasoning about possible values but mainly affects which cases are compiled in.\n\n- Any packed/attribute/packing pragmas or aliasing annotations that apply to OS_SockAddr_t/OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: these affect whether the cast from &Addr->AddrData to the accessor is well-defined and whether sa_family can be treated as a normal, mutable runtime field (or whether the cast could yield an implementation-defined/invariant result).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyzer determine if the switch expression is a genuine runtime value (no MISRA violation) or an invariant/constant expression (potential MISRA C violation), and whether the cast/overlay is well-defined so that the expression's variability is meaningful."
