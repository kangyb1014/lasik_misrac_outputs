  "explanation": "No controlling expressions that are invariant are present. The only selection statement is the switch on Accessor->sa.sa_family, which depends on the runtime value of the Addr parameter and therefore is not a constant/invariant expression. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or if-statements with constant controlling expressions. The #ifdef around AF_INET6 only changes which case labels are compiled in and does not make the switch expression invariant. The unreachable 'break' after the return in the default case is not a controlling expression and thus not relevant to Rule 14.3. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 14.3."
