  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can violate the MISRA rule about string.h bounds-safe usage, the analyzer must check whether any string-handling function is invoked directly or indirectly and whether any pointer/field accesses can read beyond the underlying object bounds. Each listed symbol is needed for that assessment:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: Provides the definition/layout of the Addr parameter. Required to confirm the size and type of Addr->AddrData and to ensure the cast to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t does not point past the end of the object.\n\n- AddrData (member/type inside OS_SockAddr_t): The exact type/length of AddrData (e.g., byte array length) is needed to verify that accessing fields via the accessor (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) stays within AddrData bounds and does not constitute an out-of-bounds access equivalent to a string function overrun.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: Defines the accessor layout (likely contains union/struct members sa, sa_in, sa_in6). Required to determine offsets of sa.sa_family, sa_in.sin_port and sa_in6.sin6_port used by the function, and to confirm those accesses are within bounds of AddrData.\n\n- struct sockaddr, struct sockaddr_in, struct sockaddr_in6: The field names (sa_family, sin_port, sin6_port) and their types/offsets come from these system structs. Their definitions are needed to be certain the code reads the correct bytes and does not read beyond the object when accessing these fields.\n\n- in_port_t: The type of sin_port/sin6_port. Needed to confirm size and aliasing/representation (and whether ntohs usage is appropriate). Also relevant because some implementations of ntohs could use byte-manipulation or memcpy internally \u2014 the implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not call string.h functions (memcpy etc.) in a way that could violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- uint16 / uint16_t: The PortNum type. Needed to confirm size compatibility and that the assignment '*PortNum = ntohs(sa_port);' does not cause an out-of-bounds write to the object pointed to by PortNum (e.g., if PortNum actually points to a smaller object).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: The family constants used in the switch. Needed to be sure the comparisons are meaningful and that any conditional compilation (e.g., IPv6 support) does not enable code paths that access fields beyond AddrData when IPv6 is present/absent.\n\n- ntohs (declaration/implementation): Although not a string function, an implementation could use memcpy or other <string.h> helpers. The analyzer must inspect ntohs to ensure it does not call memcpy/memmove/etc. that could cause bounds issues or be non-compliant with the MISRA string-handling constraint.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (compile-time macro): Affects whether the AF_INET6 branch is compiled. Needed to know which code paths are present and to inspect the sin6_port access only when that path exists.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS and OS_SUCCESS: Return codes used by the function. Needed only to fully understand control flow and to ensure no hidden function calls (macros) expand to string-handling calls in these definitions.\n\n- any packing / alignment pragmas or attributes applied to the socket-related structs: If the socket accessor or AddrData use packed attributes, alignment/packing can change offsets and may force implementations to use memcpy for unaligned accesses \u2014 which could introduce uses of string.h routines or other memory-copying helpers. The analyzer must inspect those attributes to verify no string.h calls are introduced and that accesses remain within object bounds.\n\nIn short, these symbols let the analyst confirm (1) no string.h functions are called directly in this function, (2) no indirect calls to string.h functions occur via ntohs or macros, and (3) all field reads performed through the cast accessor are within the bounds of the underlying AddrData object (so there is no out-of-bounds access equivalent to a string routine overrun)."
