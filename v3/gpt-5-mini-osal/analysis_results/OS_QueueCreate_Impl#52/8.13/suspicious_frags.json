  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type; impl is written to (impl->id = ...) so it must be a non-const pointer; name is written via snprintf so it cannot be const; &queueAttr is passed to mq_open which expects a non-const struct mq_attr *; calls to mq_unlink/mq_open/strerror use standard library signatures and do not indicate that local pointer variables could be made const. Therefore the only places that could reasonably be changed to point to const-qualified types (and thus merit investigation) are the queue pointer declaration and its subsequent reads/uses listed above."
