According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Declaring it as 'const OS_queue_internal_record_t *queue' (or 'const OS_queue_internal_record_t * const queue' if the pointer itself should not change) would avoid the violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_QueueCreate_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_queue_internal_record_t OS_impl_queue_table[OS_MAX_QUEUES]\n...\nextern OS_queue_internal_record_t OS_queue_table[OS_MAX_QUEUES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    mqd_t id;\n} OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char              queue_name[OS_MAX_API_NAME];\n    size_t            max_size;\n    osal_blockcount_t max_depth;\n} OS_queue_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In OS_QueueCreate_Impl the local pointer variable 'queue' is only used for read-only accesses (queue->max_depth, queue->max_size, queue->queue_name) and the expression assigned to it yields a non-const OS_queue_internal_record_t *. Under MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the local declaration should be changed to point to const data (for example: const OS_queue_internal_record_t *queue). Assigning a non-const pointer to a pointer-to-const is allowed and preserves the intended semantics; the other pointer 'impl' cannot be const because the code writes through it. Therefore the reported violation is valid and the code should be updated to make 'queue' point to a const-qualified type (optionally const OS_queue_internal_record_t * const queue if pointer reassignment should also be prevented)."
