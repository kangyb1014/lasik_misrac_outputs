At runtime the condition (errno == EINVAL) is evaluated but this has no side\u2011effects and removing the entire if\u2011block would not affect program behaviour. Therefore the condition and block constitute executed but redundant code (dead code) and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. With OS_DEBUG defined as an empty macro the inner if (errno == EINVAL) { ... } becomes an evaluated condition with an empty body (no side-effects). At runtime the condition may be tested, but removing the whole if-statement (including the condition) would not change observable program behaviour, so that constitutes executed but redundant code (dead code) under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. Note this depends on OS_DEBUG being empty; if OS_DEBUG produces code (or the condition has side-effects) then it would not be dead. Remedies include removing the empty if, guarding the diagnostics with preprocessor conditionals so the runtime test is also removed, or making OS_DEBUG expand to something that prevents the block from being a no-op."
