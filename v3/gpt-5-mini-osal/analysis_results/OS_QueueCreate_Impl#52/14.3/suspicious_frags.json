  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments needing investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All conditional expressions in the function depend on runtime values or function/library return values: \n\n- if (POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth > 0 && POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth < queueAttr.mq_maxmsg)\n  - Depends on the runtime global POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth and queueAttr.mq_maxmsg (derived from queue->max_depth). Not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- if (queueDesc == (mqd_t)(-1))\n  - Depends on the runtime return value of mq_open; not invariant.\n\n- if (errno == EINVAL)\n  - errno is set at runtime by the failing system call; not invariant.\n\n- if (mq_unlink(name) != 0)\n  - Depends on the runtime return value of mq_unlink; not invariant.\n\nThere are no loops with constant controlling expressions (no for/while/do-while with compile-time constant conditions) except the allowed case of infinite loops (which do not appear here). Therefore, no code fragments violate Rule 14.3 and nothing needs to be marked for further investigation under this rule."
