  "explanation": "I examined the provided code and related definitions for constructs that would constitute statically unreachable code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1). No fragments that are provably unreachable were found for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_TaskMatch_Impl: The function computes impl via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and then conditionally returns OS_ERROR if pthread_equal(...) == 0, otherwise returns OS_SUCCESS. Both branches are reachable depending on the runtime result of pthread_equal; there is no code after the return statements that would be unreachable.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET / OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: The macro expands to use OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)). In all call sites shown the argument is *token (an lvalue), so taking its address is valid; the macro yields a valid array element reference. There is no dead code introduced by the macro expansion.\n\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl: The function sets thread-specific data and returns either OS_SUCCESS or OS_ERROR depending on pthread_setspecific result. Both return paths are reachable; no unreachable statements exist.\n\n- OS_TaskCreate_Impl: The function prepares arguments, obtains task and impl table entries via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, calls OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl and returns its result. All statements are reachable in normal flow.\n\n- OS_TaskDelete_Impl: The function calls pthread_cancel and then either logs an error (ret != 0) or, on success, performs pthread_join and possibly logs if pthread_join fails. Control flows to the final return OS_SUCCESS in all cases, but there is no unreachable code (both the if and else branches are reachable depending on pthread_cancel return). The comment about \"fall through\" documents intentional continuation; it does not indicate unreachable code.\n\n- Constants OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR are simple macros; their use does not create unreachable code.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that are statically unreachable and therefore require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
