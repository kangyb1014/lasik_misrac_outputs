  "explanation": "Other code fragments need not be investigated for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or are intentionally mutable. Specifically:\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so the token pointer already follows the rule.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const OS_object_token_t *, so indexing from the token does not violate the rule.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_impl_task_table[] yield an address of the (mutable) table element; the table is a global mutable structure (likely intended to be modified elsewhere), so the array definition itself need not be changed to const without broader design consideration.\n- Access to impl->id (a pthread_t member) is a read-only use here; the member itself is not a pointer type subject to Rule 8.13.\nTherefore the primary locations that warrant investigation are the pointer declaration, its initialization from the table, and subsequent use through that pointer (listed above)."
