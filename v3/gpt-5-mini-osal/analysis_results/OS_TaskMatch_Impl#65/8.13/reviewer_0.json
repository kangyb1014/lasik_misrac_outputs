Therefore it could and should be declared as const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl to indicate read-only access.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_TaskMatch_Impl the local variable impl is only used to read impl->id and there is no write through that pointer, so it could and should be declared as pointer to const (e.g. const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl). The macro yields the address of a table element (type OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *), and converting that to pointer-to-const is allowed in C, so there is no impediment to making impl point-to-const. Therefore the code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible)."
