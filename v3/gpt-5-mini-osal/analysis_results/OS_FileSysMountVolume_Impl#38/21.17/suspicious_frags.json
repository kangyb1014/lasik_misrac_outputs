  "explanation": "No calls to the <string.h> string-handling functions listed by MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl. The function only passes local->system_mountpt to POSIX calls stat() and mkdir(), and calls strerror(errno) for diagnostic text. strerror does not take a user buffer pointer parameter and is not one of the listed string.h buffer-manipulation functions covered by Rule 21.17. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty in the provided context, so there is no hidden printf/str* use here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: ensuring that system_mountpt contains a valid null-terminated path is a general correctness concern, but it is not a use of the string.h functions targeted by Rule 21.17.)"
