  "explanation": "The function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type, so it does not need investigation. The character arrays in the record (device_name, volume_name, system_mountpt, virtual_mountpt) are array objects (not pointer types) and their use here is limited to read-only operations, so they do not violate the rule as pointer types. The inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a pointer to const. No other pointer variables are declared or used in this function, and the calls to stat/mkdir/strerror/strerror accept const char* appropriately. The listed fragments are the remaining locations where non-const pointer types or non-const access to table data occur and thus warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
