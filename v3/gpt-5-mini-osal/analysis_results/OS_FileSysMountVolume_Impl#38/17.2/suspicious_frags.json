  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not require investigation for indirect or direct self-calls: the comparisons of local->fstype against constants and the return statements are simple control flow and cannot cause calls into other functions. The S_ISDIR macro and the fstype constant checks are compile-time/bitmask checks and do not perform function calls. The provided inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and contains no calls, so it cannot introduce recursion. Standard C library system calls shown (stat, mkdir, strerror) are well-defined library functions that do not call back into user-defined functions in this context. Therefore only the listed fragments (calls/macros whose implementations are not shown or could expand to other OSAL functions) need further inspection for possible direct or indirect recursion."
