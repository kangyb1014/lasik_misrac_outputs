True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIn the provided build, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) ). The source line OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Cannot create mount point %s: %s\", local->system_mountpt, strerror(errno)); therefore expands to a null statement (effectively just \";\") that is executed when the mkdir() error branch is taken but has no effect. Removing that null statement would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_filesys_internal_record_t OS_filesys_table[OS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEMS]\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char device_name[OS_FS_DEV_NAME_LEN]; /**< The name of the underlying block device, if applicable */\n    char volume_name[OS_FS_VOL_NAME_LEN];\n    char system_mountpt[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN]; /**< The name/prefix where the contents are accessible in the host\n                                                   operating system */\n    char virtual_mountpt[OS_MAX_PATH_LEN]; /**< The name/prefix in the OSAL Virtual File system exposed to applications\n                                            */\n    char *            address;\n    size_t            blocksize;\n    osal_blockcount_t numblocks;\n    uint8             flags;\n    uint8             fstype;\n} OS_filesys_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED (-106)\n...\n#define OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (-28)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct for the described build configuration. With OS_DEBUG defined as an empty variadic macro, the statement\n    OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Cannot create mount point %s: %s\", local->system_mountpt, strerror(errno));\npreprocessor-expands to a null statement (a lone \u2018;\u2019). That null statement is executed when the mkdir() error path is taken but has no effect; removing it would not change observable program behaviour (no side-effects, no function calls are evaluated), so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nNotes/nuance:\n- This conclusion is conditional on the build configuration that defines OS_DEBUG as empty. If OS_DEBUG is defined to do logging, then the statement is not dead. MISRA 2.2 is a project-wide rule, so the presence/absence of dead code depends on the macros used in the actual build.\n- In very timing-sensitive embedded systems it is conceivable that removing even a null statement could change timing and thus behaviour; MISRA Note 1 points this out. In practice an empty macro call like this is treated as dead code and should be removed or guarded appropriately (e.g. use a mechanism that omits the entire statement in builds intended to be MISRA-clean or document/justify the exception)."
