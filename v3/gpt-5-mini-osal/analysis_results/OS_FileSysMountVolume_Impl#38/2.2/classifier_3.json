  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "In the provided build, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) ). The source line OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Cannot create mount point %s: %s\", local->system_mountpt, strerror(errno)); therefore expands to a null statement (effectively just \";\") that is executed when the mkdir() error branch is taken but has no effect. Removing that null statement would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
