  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, and there is no assignment to token anywhere in the function (no modifications to the pointer itself).\n- The macro is invoked as OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token). Macro expansion yields &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], and &(*token) is equivalent to token; this uses the address-of and dereference operators but does not modify the pointer parameter.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const OS_object_token_t * and only reads token->obj_idx; it does not modify the object or the pointer.\n- impl is an lvalue local variable receiving the address of an entry from OS_impl_condvar_table; assigning that address does not alter the function parameter.\n- The call to pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cv) passes the condition variable from the table; modifying the condition variable object (via pthread) is allowed by the rule because the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified. In any case, the function parameter token itself is not modified.\nGiven these points, there are no places in the provided code where the function parameter token or the pointer itself is modified, so no fragments require investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
