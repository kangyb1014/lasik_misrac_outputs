  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are visible in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs (function declaration, pointer dereference, struct pointer access, function call, if/return). Calls to POSIX pthreads (pthread_cond_broadcast) are a library/API usage, not a compiler language extension. Identifiers such as int32, OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t and the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET are project-defined types/macros; their mere use here does not imply a compiler language extension (no use of __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions, named address spaces, or other common compiler-specific extensions is present). Because the definition/implementation of those types/macros is not shown, they could be reviewed separately, but based on this fragment alone there is no evidence of a compiler language extension that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
