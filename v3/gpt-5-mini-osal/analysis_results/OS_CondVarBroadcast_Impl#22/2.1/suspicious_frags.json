  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl that constitute unreachable code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1). Reasoning: \n\n- The function has no statements after a return that would be unreachable.\n- The only conditional (if (status != 0)) has two distinct return paths; both are potentially reachable at run time because pthread_cond_broadcast can return zero or a non-zero error code. There is no constant expression making either branch impossible.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array indexing expression that produces impl; this does not create unreachable code (although it can cause undefined behaviour if the token is invalid or NULL, that is not the same as unreachable code).\n- There are no compile-time constant conditionals, infinite loops, gotos to skipped labels, or other constructs that would make any code in this function impossible to execute.\n\nNote: While there are potential robustness/undefined-behaviour concerns (e.g., dereferencing a NULL token, out-of-bounds index into OS_impl_condvar_table), these are not instances of unreachable code and thus are outside the scope of Rule 2.1. If you want, I can flag those as separate issues to investigate under other MISRA rules (e.g., object lifetime, bounds checking, null pointer dereference)."
