  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided code show direct or indirect self-calls. Call graph from the provided code is: OS_CondVarBroadcast -> OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl -> pthread_cond_broadcast. OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl also uses the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro which expands to access OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)), and that static inline only returns token->obj_idx (no function calls). None of these fragments call OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl or OS_CondVarBroadcast back, and there is no recursion within OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl itself. The external call pthread_cond_broadcast is a POSIX API and does not invoke the application\u2019s OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl. Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion, so no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. If additional code (for example the implementation of OS_ObjectIdGetById or any other system-level callbacks) were available and could call back into OS_CondVarBroadcast or OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl, those would need to be reviewed; however, no such code is present in the supplied snippets."
