  "scenario": "The call passes the address of OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState to pthread_setcancelstate, which expects an int * to store the previous cancel state. Because the function will write through that pointer, the pointed-to object must be modifiable (non-const). Therefore there is no opportunity to make the pointer point to a const-qualified type here, and no MISRA 8.13 violation occurs. (A violation would occur only if AccessCancelState were declared const and then coerced or cast to int *.)"
