  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments (OS_BSP_Lock_Impl, OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl) and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp. None of the routines perform string comparisons using memcmp; they either call pthread APIs, strerror (for diagnostic printing), write (which writes raw bytes with an explicit length), or manipulate buffer indices/lengths. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
