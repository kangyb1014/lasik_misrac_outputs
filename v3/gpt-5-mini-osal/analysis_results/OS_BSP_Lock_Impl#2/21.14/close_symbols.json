  "explanation": "We need the implementations/definitions of the listed symbols because the MISRA rule in question forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The target function itself does not call memcmp, but it invokes or expands to other symbols that might: \n\n- BSP_DEBUG: This is the logging macro used on error paths. It may expand to code that formats or compares strings (or call other logging functions). If BSP_DEBUG's expansion uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, that would be a MISRA violation reachable from OS_BSP_Lock_Impl.\n\n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl and OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: BSP_DEBUG is likely implemented on top of console output functions. Those implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not use memcmp to compare C strings.\n\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl: Included because BSP_DEBUG or console output implementations can call or interact with matching lock/unlock functionality; also present in the static call graph and may contain string comparisons used by console code.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (definition including AccessMutex and AccessCancelState): Provides the types and any possible macros/accessors used in the function. Macros or inline accessors associated with this global might contain string comparisons; include the definition to inspect for memcmp usage.\n\n- strerror: The function calls strerror(status) to get an error string. While standard library internals are typically out of scope, the project may provide wrappers or replacements; include strerror's declaration/implementation to verify no project code uses memcmp on null-terminated strings when producing the error message.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_setcancelstate: Include their declarations/any project wrappers. If the project wraps pthread APIs, those wrappers might perform string comparisons; verify no memcmp usage in those wrappers.\n\nIn short, include BSP_DEBUG and the console-output related functions/macros first (highest likelihood of string comparisons), then the global struct definition and any wrappers for strerror/pthread calls so the next analyst can determine whether any reachable code from OS_BSP_Lock_Impl uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
