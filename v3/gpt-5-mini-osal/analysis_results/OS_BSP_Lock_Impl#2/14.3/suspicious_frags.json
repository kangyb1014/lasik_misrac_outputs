  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are manifestly invariant. The only conditional is\n    if (status < 0)\nwhere `status` is assigned from the call to pthread_mutex_lock immediately beforehand, so the controlling expression depends on a run-time value (not a compile-time constant) and is not invariant under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. There are no while/for/do-while loops or other conditionals using constant expressions in the function. The call to pthread_setcancelstate uses a macro constant as an argument but that is not a controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
