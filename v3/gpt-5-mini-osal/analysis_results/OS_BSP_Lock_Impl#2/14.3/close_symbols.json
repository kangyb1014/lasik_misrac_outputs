  "explanation": "- pthread_mutex_lock: The value assigned to 'status' comes directly from this call. To decide if the controlling expression (status < 0) is invariant you must know the function's contract/implementation (possible return values, whether it can vary at runtime, or if it is implemented as a compile-time constant/macro).\\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: The call passes &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex. You must inspect this global (its declaration and how/where it is initialized/used) to determine whether the mutex state can vary at runtime and thus cause pthread_mutex_lock to return different values.\\n- pthread_mutex_t (type of AccessMutex): Understanding the mutex type clarifies how lock attempts behave (e.g. shared/static initializer vs. dynamic object), which affects whether pthread_mutex_lock can succeed or fail at runtime and so whether 'status' can be non\u2011invariant.\\n- pthread_mutex_lock (unit-test/mock replacement, e.g. stubs used by UT_BSP_Lock): Unit tests or a test harness may replace pthread_mutex_lock with a stub that always returns a fixed value. To conclude that the controlling expression is non\u2011invariant in the analyzed build, you must check for any such replacements (for example those introduced by UT_BSP_Lock or the test framework) that could make 'status < 0' always true/false."
