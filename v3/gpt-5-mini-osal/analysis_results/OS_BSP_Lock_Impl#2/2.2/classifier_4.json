  "scenario": "The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined as empty (#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)). After preprocessing the statement disappears entirely, so there is no operation executed. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code (operations that are executed but removable without changing behaviour). Since the call is not executed (it is removed by the macro), it is not dead code and does not violate Rule 2.2. Note: if BSP_DEBUG expands to code in other build configurations, that expansion should be checked for dead code separately."
