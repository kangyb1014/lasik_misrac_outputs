  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 were found. Reasoning:\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl has no formal parameters, so there are no function parameters in this function that could be modified (Rule 17.8 concerns modifying a function parameter itself).\n- The local variable 'status' is modified, but it is not a function parameter, so Rule 17.8 does not apply.\n- Calls that take pointer arguments (pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex) and pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState)) pass addresses of objects; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is explicitly permitted by the rule. Therefore these calls do not indicate a Rule 17.8 violation in this caller.\n- BSP_DEBUG is defined empty, so it introduces no parameter modification here.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
