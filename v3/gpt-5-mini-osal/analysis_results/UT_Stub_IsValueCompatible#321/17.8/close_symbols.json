  "explanation": "- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: Required to see the struct/typedef definition and const-qualification of the pointed-to object (i.e., whether Rvc is pointer-to-const and the exact types of its members). This determines whether accesses like Rvc->TypeName or Rvc->Genre could be writes to the object referred-to or whether the pointer itself could be altered by macros/definitions.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: Needed to confirm it is a value/enum type (passed by value) rather than a pointer/indirection; this affects whether comparing WantGenre to Rvc->Genre is a non-modifying value read.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The enumerator/constant used in the condition must be known to verify it is a compile-time constant (no hidden side-effects) and to understand the Genre comparison semantics.\n\n- TypeName (field of UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t): The exact declaration/type of this field (e.g., const char * vs char *) is needed to determine if reading Rvc->TypeName is allowed under the function parameter rule and whether any indirect modification could occur.\n\n- Genre (field of UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t): The field accessed for comparison; its type and qualifiers determine whether the code reads or might (via macros/overloaded definitions) modify the parameter object.\n\n- strcmp: Prototype/semantics are required to confirm it does not modify its pointer arguments (it performs read-only comparisons) so calls cannot count as modifying the pointer parameters or pointed-to objects.\n\n- NULL: Definition of NULL (null pointer constant) is needed to confirm the comparisons against NULL are pure pointer comparisons, not macros with side effects.\n\n- bool / true / false (from <stdbool.h>): To verify the boolean type/values used (IsCompatible) are the standard non-modifying boolean semantics.\n\n- string.h (<strcmp> prototype): Inclusion/definition context to ensure strcmp is the standard function (no macro redefinition) and thus has no side effects on parameters.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether any statement in the function assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (Rvc, WantTypeName, WantGenre) or the objects they point to, and whether any called routine/macros could have hidden side effects that would violate the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified."
