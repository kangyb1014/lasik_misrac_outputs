  "explanation": "To determine whether any branch in UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible is provably unreachable the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The full struct definition (at least the types of members TypeName and Genre). The function dereferences Rvc and reads Rvc->TypeName and Rvc->Genre; knowing these member types and any invariants on them (e.g. always non-NULL TypeName) is necessary to decide whether the first if/else or later checks can ever be taken.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The enum/type definition for Genre. The second conditional uses comparisons on Genre; to determine if that condition can ever be true (or is redundant/always false) the set of possible enum values and any special relationships must be known.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The specific enum constant used in the second condition. If UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE equals some other enumerator or has a special value, it can make the expression Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE && Rvc->Genre == WantGenre constant-foldable, which affects reachability.\n\n- strcmp: The semantics/prototype of strcmp (usually from <string.h>) are needed because the initial compatibility decision uses strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName) == 0. If strcmp were redefined or has non-standard side effects, that can affect whether the first branch can succeed and therefore whether the subsequent code is reachable.\n\n- NULL: The definition of NULL (and any project-specific guarantees about nullness) is required to reason about the pointer comparisons Rvc->TypeName != NULL and WantTypeName != NULL; whether those comparisons can be resolved statically affects reachability.\n\n- bool / true / false (from <stdbool.h>): The boolean type and constants are used for variable initialization and return; knowing their definitions is needed for correct interpretation of logical expressions and constant folding.\n\nNote: In addition to these symbols, any external/precondition information (caller contracts such as \"Rvc is guaranteed non-NULL\" or \"WantTypeName is never NULL\") should be provided to the analyzer, because such invariants directly determine whether code paths that dereference or check those pointers are reachable."
