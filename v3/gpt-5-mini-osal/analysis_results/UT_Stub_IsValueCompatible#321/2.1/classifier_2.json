  "scenario": "No violation: the return statement is reachable on all control-flow paths. The function always executes the first if/else which assigns IsCompatible, optionally executes the second conditional to update it, and then reaches the return. There are no intervening infinite loops, early returns, or conditional constructs that would make the final return unreachable."
