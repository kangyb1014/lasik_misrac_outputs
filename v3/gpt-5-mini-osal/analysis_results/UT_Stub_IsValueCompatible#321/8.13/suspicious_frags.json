  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that should point to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer usages that could violate Rule 8.13 are the uses of the TypeName member accessed via Rvc. Although Rvc itself is a pointer-to-const struct and WantTypeName is already const-qualified, that does not guarantee that the TypeName member inside the struct is a pointer-to-const (it may be declared as char *). Therefore the function signature and the two places where Rvc->TypeName is used should be investigated to confirm the member's declaration is const-correct. Other fragments need not be investigated: WantTypeName is already const-qualified; the NULL comparisons and the Genre comparisons do not involve pointers that could be further const-qualified; and there are no other pointer expressions in the function body that would be subject to Rule 8.13."
