  "explanation": "To determine whether the use of strcmp in UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible can result in out-of-bounds accesses (MISRA rule regarding <string.h> functions), the analyzer needs the following additional symbols and information:\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t (type/struct definition): The exact struct layout is required to confirm that TypeName is a pointer to char (or something else) and to discover any invariants or annotations on the struct that guarantee string properties.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName (member declaration / contract): Knowing the declared type is not enough \u2014 the analysis must know the contract for this member (is it guaranteed to be NULL or a NUL-terminated C string? can it point to non-terminated data?). This directly affects whether strcmp may read beyond object bounds.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t (enum definition) and UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE (enumerator value): These determine the alternative control flow that can skip or trigger strcmp. If Genre checks prevent strcmp from being called in certain cases, that changes whether a violation is possible. The exact enum values/semantics are needed to reason about the branch that avoids strcmp.\n\n- strcmp (int strcmp(const char *, const char *)): The prototype and its documented semantics (it reads both strings until a terminating '\\0') are required so the analyzer can reason about its preconditions (both pointers must point to NUL-terminated arrays) and the risk of overruns.\n\n- All callers of UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible (call sites): Knowing how this function is used (what actual pointers are passed for WantTypeName and what Rvc values are supplied) is necessary to determine whether the preconditions for strcmp are met at each call site.\n\n- All initializers/assigners of UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName (functions/locations that set/populate TypeName): If TypeName is sometimes set to point at non-terminated data, transient buffers, or freed memory, strcmp could overread. You must inspect the functions that populate TypeName to see if they guarantee a NUL-terminated string and sufficient lifetime.\n\n- All producers/sources of WantTypeName (callers or functions that allocate/return the strings passed as WantTypeName): Similarly, the origin of WantTypeName must assure it is a valid NUL-terminated string that remains accessible for the strcmp call.\n\n- Storage/allocator symbols for the strings pointed to by TypeName and WantTypeName (e.g., static buffers, malloc/free sites, string literals): Whether the pointed-to objects are string literals (safe), statically allocated buffers (usually safe if NUL-terminated), heap allocations (requires lifetime checks), or transient stack buffers affects whether strcmp can read beyond their bounds or use freed memory.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether both operands to strcmp are non-NULL and guaranteed to be NUL-terminated, (2) whether their storage/lifetimes are sufficient at each call site, and (3) whether control-flow (Genre checks) can avoid calling strcmp in risky situations. Without these symbols/contracts, you cannot conclude whether the strcmp invocation could read beyond object bounds and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
