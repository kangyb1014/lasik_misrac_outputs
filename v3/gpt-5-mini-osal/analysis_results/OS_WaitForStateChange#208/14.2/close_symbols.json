The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The target function calls this function and the MISRA requirement explicitly says the behaviour of a for-loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. To determine if any for-loops (and whether they are well-formed) are involved via called code, the implementation/definition of this callee must be inspected.\\n- OS_object_token_t: The target indexes into OS_objtype_state using token->obj_type and passes token->obj_type to the Impl function. The token type definition is required to know the type and valid range/semantics of obj_type and whether it could be used as or modified by any loop counters inside called code.\\n- OS_objtype_state_t: The target reads and writes the owner_key field of this structure. To judge whether any for-loop in this function or callees improperly uses or modifies objects that are modified in the loop body (MISRA clauses 2\u20134), the structure layout and field types (especially owner_key) are required.\\n- OS_objtype_state: The actual global array/object being indexed (&OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]) must be known to see aliasing, lifetime, and whether other code (including loops) might treat elements as loop counters or modify them.\\n- osal_key_t: The type of owner_key; needed to determine whether assignments to owner_key constitute modifications that would violate the rule if the same object is used as a loop counter or in loop clauses in this function or called functions.\\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The macro/constant used to temporarily assign owner_key; include its definition to ensure it has no hidden side-effects (it should be a pure constant) and to confirm the assignment does not violate the rule about side-effects in loop clauses."
