  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl\n  - The target function delegates the wait/unlock behavior to this implementation. To determine whether the writes/reads in the target are necessary (or redundant/dead) we must know exactly what the Impl function does (does it restore owner_key, does it re-acquire the lock, does it modify global state or just block), and whether it has side effects that make the surrounding assignments relevant.\n\n- OS_objtype_state (global) and OS_objtype_state_t\n  - The target indexes into a global table (OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]) and modifies a member. Analyzing whether those writes/reads are observable (hence not dead) requires the complete type definition and the global object so other accesses can be discovered.\n\n- owner_key (member of OS_objtype_state_t)\n  - The code reads saved_unlock_key = objtype->owner_key and later restores objtype->owner_key. To judge if those operations are dead, you must know how owner_key is used elsewhere (who reads it, what semantics it encodes) and whether changing it has observable effects.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The function accesses token->obj_type. You need the token type to verify the validity and domain of obj_type, and to determine whether indexing into OS_objtype_state could be invalid or whether obj_type semantics make the read/write observable.\n\n- osal_key_t\n  - The saved_unlock_key variable type. Its representation and possible aliasing/side-effect semantics (e.g., volatile, atomic) can affect whether the read/restore are observable; also required to match semantics of owner_key.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID\n  - The function assigns this value into owner_key. You must know its value/semantics to know whether the assignment changes state in an observable way (e.g., is it a special sentry that other code checks?). If it equals the previous value then the write might be a no-op; if not, it could be observable.\n\n- All functions that read/write OS_objtype_state[].owner_key (lock/unlock implementations, e.g. OS_Unlock_Global / OS_Lock_Global or any acquire/release helpers)\n  - To decide whether the read and subsequent restore of owner_key are required (i.e., not dead), you must identify every code location that inspects or depends on owner_key. If no other code reads owner_key between the write-to-INVALID and the restore, the assignments may be dead; conversely, if other functions rely on it, the assignments are live. Therefore include all symbols that access that member so their interactions can be analyzed.\n\n- Any synchronization primitives and helper functions used by OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl (condition-variable wait/atomic unlock+wait implementations)\n  - The comment indicates the implementation performs an \u2018\u2018unlock + wait\u2019\u2019 atomically. To judge whether the temporary clear of owner_key is necessary (or redundant), the semantics of the underlying synchronization (atomicity, re-acquisition behavior, whether it restores owner information) must be known. Include the primitives/helpers used by the Impl routine.\n\nNote: The goal is to be able to determine whether the read of owner_key, the write of OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID, and the final restore are observable by any other code. That requires the Impl implementation, the global table/type definition, the owner_key usage sites, and the locking/synchronization primitives. Include the listed symbols (and any discovered additional functions that access owner_key) in the next-agent prompt for a complete dead-code analysis."
