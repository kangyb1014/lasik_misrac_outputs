  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (\"memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\"):\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl\n  - This is the only direct callee of OS_WaitForStateChange. Any use of memcmp that would cause a MISRA violation could occur inside this implementation; you must inspect its body to see if it calls memcmp (or a wrapper) to compare strings.\n\n- memcmp\n  - The standard library function constrained by the MISRA rule. Search for direct uses of memcmp in the target and in callees to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated C-strings (which would violate the rule).\n\n- OS_memcmp and OSAL_memcmp\n  - Project-specific wrappers or aliases for memcmp are common in embedded code. Inspect these symbols (if present) because they may call memcmp internally or implement an equivalent compare on strings; such indirect uses must also be flagged.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The token argument is passed through to the impl. Its fields (types/pointers) must be inspected to see whether any string pointer or null-terminated buffer could be being compared by memcmp in the callee; this helps decide if a memcmp call is comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_objtype_state\n  - Although this type in the target function is used only for owner_key manipulation, its definition should be checked in case it contains string members or inlined helpers that might be compared by memcmp in the impl/context.\n\n- string.h\n  - The standard header declares memcmp and related functions; include/inspection can reveal macros or platform-specific defines that alter memcmp usage or map other names onto it.\n\nNotes:\n- The minimal\u5fc5symbols to inspect are OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl and memcmp (and any project wrappers). The type definitions (OS_object_token_t, OS_objtype_state) are included because they can change the interpretation of arguments passed to compare functions (i.e., whether buffers are null-terminated strings)."
