  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_WaitForStateChange, its helper OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl, and the related type/variable definitions. None of the presented code fragments contain any call to memcmp, nor any obvious macro or wrapper that aliases memcmp. The shown POSIX calls (pthread_cond_timedwait, clock_gettime, pthread_cleanup_push) and the assignments/manipulations of owner_key do not involve string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If there are other source files or macros not shown that could call memcmp (or define a memcmp alias), please provide them so they can be checked."
