  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the provided code do not qualify for conversion to pointers-to-const and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 8.13: \n\n- The local pointer objtype (declared as OS_objtype_state_t *objtype and assigned via objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];) is used to modify the table (objtype->owner_key is written to), so the pointed-to type must be mutable. \n\n- The pointer variable impl (OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl) is used with pthread_cond_timedwait and pthread_cleanup_push, which operate on and modify the mutex/cond objects; those fields cannot be treated as const. \n\n- The global OS_objtype_state array is updated (owner_key), so its elements are not const-qualified. \n\n- The timespec variable ts is passed to pthread_cond_timedwait as a const parameter expected by the POSIX API; this is an API call usage and does not imply a local pointer should be const-qualified. \n\n- saved_unlock_key and other non-pointer objects are not relevant to Rule 8.13. \n\nTherefore, aside from the function parameter listed above, there are no other pointer declarations/usages in the shown code that can or should be changed to point-to-const without breaking required modifications."
