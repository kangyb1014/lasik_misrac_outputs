  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t: Needed to see the token parameter layout (members and types). In particular, confirm what token->obj_type is (an integral index field) and that accessing it does not modify the token pointer itself.\n\nOS_objtype_state: The global array/variable referenced as &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] must be inspected to confirm it is a plain global container (not a macro or function-like accessor) and that taking its address does not have side effects that could modify the token parameter.\n\nOS_objtype_state_t: The pointed-to structure type is required to see its members (owner_key) and their types so modifications (objtype->owner_key = ...) are known to affect the pointed object only and not the pointer parameter.\n\nosal_key_t: The type of owner_key; needed to ensure the assignment operations on objtype->owner_key are normal assignments to a field and not operations that could alias or modify the token pointer itself.\n\nOS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The macro/constant assigned to owner_key should be checked (type and definition) to ensure it does not expand to an expression that modifies the function parameter or has side effects.\n\nOS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The prototype/definition of the implementation function is required to ensure the call OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl(token->obj_type, attempts) does not accept the token pointer (or otherwise modify the token parameter) \u2014 i.e., that no indirect modification of the token parameter occurs via this call."
