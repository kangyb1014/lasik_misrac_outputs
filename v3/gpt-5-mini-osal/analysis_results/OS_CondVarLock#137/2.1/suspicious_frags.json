  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected. The function contains a single conditional (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)) that may or may not execute its body depending on the value returned by OS_ObjectIdGetById; both the body and the following return statement are reachable in different execution paths. There are no early return statements that skip later code unconditionally, no unconditional jumps, no infinite loops, and no code after a guaranteed non-returning call. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that are provably unreachable and requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
