True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes the address of a local OS_object_token_t variable (&token) to OS_CondVarLock_Impl which (by its usage here) is declared to take a pointer to a non-const OS_object_token_t. If OS_CondVarLock_Impl does not modify the token (i.e. it only reads/inspects it), then the pointer parameter should be const-qualified and the current non-const pointer usage violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, OS_CondVarLock_Impl legitimately modifies the token, then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not provably correct based on the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 does recommend that pointer parameters point to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified, but whether a violation exists depends on the declaration/behavior of OS_CondVarLock_Impl. The code shown simply passes &token (a non-const local) to OS_CondVarLock_Impl. If OS_CondVarLock_Impl is declared to take a const OS_object_token_t * or if it actually modifies the token, then there is no violation. If OS_CondVarLock_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer but does not modify the token, then the code (and the function prototype) should be changed to use a const pointer to satisfy Rule 8.13. In short: the agent\u2019s claim is plausible but not proven by the provided code \u2014 you must inspect the prototype/definition of OS_CondVarLock_Impl to determine whether a Rule 8.13 violation actually exists. Recommended action: check/adjust the OS_CondVarLock_Impl parameter to const OS_object_token_t * if it does not modify the token, otherwise retain and document the modification intent."
