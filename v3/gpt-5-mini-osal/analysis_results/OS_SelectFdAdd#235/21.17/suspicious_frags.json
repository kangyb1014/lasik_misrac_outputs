  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of the string handling functions from <string.h> and accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by their pointer parameters. Since the target function and the related snippets do not invoke any <string.h> routines, there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate.\n\nNotes (not for Rule 21.17):\n- The write to Set->object_ids[local_id >> 3] could potentially be out-of-bounds if the computed local_id range does not match the array size; however this is not related to Rule 21.17 because it does not involve <string.h> functions. Validation of that potential array-bounds issue should be done against other relevant MISRA rules (array bounds, index validation), not Rule 21.17.\n- The pointer check OS_CHECK_POINTER(Set) ensures Set is non-NULL, but again this does not involve <string.h> usage."
