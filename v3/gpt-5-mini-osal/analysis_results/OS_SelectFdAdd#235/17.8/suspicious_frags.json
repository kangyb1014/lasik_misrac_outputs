  "explanation": "These are the only places where the function parameter 'Set' is directly used in a way that could modify either the pointer variable or the object it points to. The assignment to Set->object_ids modifies the object pointed to by the parameter (which is permitted by the rule but should be checked to ensure the pointer itself is not changed). The macro invocation OS_CHECK_POINTER(Set) could potentially expand to code that modifies the parameter variable, so it must be inspected. Other fragments do not modify function parameters: the call to OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex passes objid by value and writes to a local (local_id), return_code is a local variable, and the function signature and return statement do not modify parameters."
