  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_GenericSeek_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_GenericSeek_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, int32 offset, uint32 whence)\n{\n    int                             where;\n    off_t                           os_result;\n    int32                           retval;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    switch (whence)\n    {\n        case OS_SEEK_SET:\n            where = SEEK_SET;\n            break;\n        case OS_SEEK_CUR:\n            where = SEEK_CUR;\n            break;\n        case OS_SEEK_END:\n            where = SEEK_END;\n            break;\n        default:\n            return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    os_result = lseek(impl->fd, (off_t)offset, where);\n    if (os_result == (off_t)-1)\n    {\n        if (errno == ESPIPE)\n        {\n            /*\n             * this means the user tried to seek on a pipe, socket,\n             * or other fifo-like handle that doesn't support seeking.\n             *\n             * Use a different error code to differentiate from an\n             * error involving a bad whence/offset\n             */\n            retval = OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * Most likely the \"whence\" and/or \"offset\" combo was not valid.\n             */\n            OS_DEBUG(\"lseek: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n            retval = OS_ERROR;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * convert value to int32 type for returning to caller.\n         * Note that this could potentially overflow an int32\n         * for a large file seek.\n         */\n        retval = (int32)os_result;\n    }\n\n    return retval;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_GenericSeek_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_file_internal_record_t OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int  fd;\n    bool selectable;\n} OS_impl_file_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SEEK_SET 0\n...\n#define OS_SEEK_CUR 1\n...\n#define OS_SEEK_END 2\n...\n#define OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (-38)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nint32 OS_lseek(osal_id_t filedes, int32 offset, uint32 whence)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Make sure the file descriptor is legit before using it */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, filedes, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_GenericSeek_Impl(&token, offset, whence);\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No \u2014 the empty OS_DEBUG macro definition itself is not dead code. It merely removes optional debug output at compile time; the macro expansion produces no executed operation, so there is no executed operation present whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Caveat: if calls to OS_DEBUG contain argument expressions with side\u2011effects (for example OS_DEBUG(\"%d\", x++); or a function call that must run), then removing those argument evaluations would change program behaviour. Such usage would create a rule\u20112.2 concern (e.g. the increment or function call being compiled out), so ensure debug arguments have no side effects."
