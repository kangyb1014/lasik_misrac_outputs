  "explanation": "I found no unreachable code fragments in OS_GenericSeek_Impl that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Reasoning: \n\n- All declarations at the start are just variable definitions and not unreachable. They are used later in the function. \n- The switch(whence) covers the three valid whence values (OS_SEEK_SET, OS_SEEK_CUR, OS_SEEK_END) and sets 'where' for each. The default: branch returns immediately with OS_ERROR. That early return is intentional to handle invalid inputs; it does not create unintended unreachable code elsewhere \u2014 it is a deliberate conditional return for invalid arguments. \n- The call to lseek(impl->fd, (off_t)offset, where) is reachable whenever whence is one of the valid constants; it is not in practice unreachable. \n- Both branches of the if (os_result == (off_t)-1) are reachable: when lseek fails, the errno==ESPIPE and else paths handle different failure reasons; when lseek succeeds the else branch converting the off_t to int32 is reachable. There is no code after the final return that would be dead. \n- The OS_DEBUG macro expands to nothing, but that is a preprocessing detail (it does not create unreachable code in the compiled program); the surrounding logic (setting retval = OS_ERROR in that branch) remains meaningful and reachable. \n- Macro usage (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) is used to obtain a table entry; although out-of-range indices would be an error or undefined behavior, that would not make any code textually unreachable inside this function \u2014 it would instead cause runtime/addressing issues. \n\nBecause every source path in this function is either executed or intentionally returns for invalid input, and there are no dead statements after unconditional returns or conditionals that are always false, there are no suspicious unreachable-code fragments to report."
