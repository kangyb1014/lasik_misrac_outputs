  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no vendor-specific keywords or identifiers (no __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), label-as-values, or other known compiler extensions).\n- The code uses standard C casts, standard control structures (switch/case), and standard typedefs (int32_t/uint32_t) \u2014 none are compiler extensions.\n- The inline function (static inline) and variadic macro-style OS_DEBUG are standard C99 features, not compiler extensions.\n- Use of POSIX APIs/types (lseek, off_t, SEEK_SET/SEEK_CUR/SEEK_END, errno, strerror) are operating-system/library functions, not compiler language extensions; Rule 1.2 targets language/compiler extensions as documented by the compiler, so these do not qualify.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and its usage (passing *token which becomes &( *token )) rely on standard C expression/addressing rules and are not compiler-specific.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments to flag for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
