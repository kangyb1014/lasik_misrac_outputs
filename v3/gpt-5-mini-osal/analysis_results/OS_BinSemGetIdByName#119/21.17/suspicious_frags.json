  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sem_name, sem_id);",
    "OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_name);",
    "int32 OS_BinSemGetIdByName(osal_id_t *sem_id, const char *sem_name)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The code does not call any <string.h> functions directly, but the sem_name parameter is forwarded to OS_ObjectIdFindByName; that call and the sem_name pointer check should be inspected to ensure any string handling inside OS_ObjectIdFindByName does not access beyond object bounds. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17: OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_id) only validates a non-string output pointer (not relevant to string bounds), the local variable declaration (int32 return_code;) and the final return (return return_code;) do not perform string operations, and the comment/brace lines are non-operative. These parts cannot cause string.h bounds violations by themselves."
