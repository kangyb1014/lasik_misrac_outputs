  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the sem_name parameter in the prototype is already const-qualified (so it conforms to the rule), the local variable return_code is not a pointer, and the return statement merely returns a scalar value. The flagged fragments cover places where a non-const pointer is introduced or propagated (parameter, macro null-checks, and the call that passes the pointer), which are the relevant locations to verify whether the pointer could or should be to a const-qualified type."
