  "scenario": "No violation: the macro invocation OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_name) will typically expand to a runtime check such as if (sem_name == NULL) { ... } whose controlling expression depends on the parameter and therefore is not invariant. A violation would occur if the macro actually expanded to a controlling expression that is a compile-time constant (for example if (0) or if (1) or a loop whose condition is a constant) \u2014 excepting permitted cases such as an intentional infinite loop, which the standard allows."
