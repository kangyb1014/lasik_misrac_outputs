  "explanation": "The visible code snippet contains no explicit controlling statements (if, for, while, do/while, or switch) or controlling expressions apart from the listed lines. The remaining lines\u2014function signature, local variable declaration, comments, and the final return statement\u2014do not include controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3. The listed fragments are the only places in this snippet that could conceal controlling expressions (via macro expansion or the called function), so they are the ones that should be inspected further."
