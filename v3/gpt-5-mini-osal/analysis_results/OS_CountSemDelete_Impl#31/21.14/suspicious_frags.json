  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp, no other standard library string-comparison functions (e.g. strcmp, strncmp), and no operations on char arrays or null-terminated strings. The only operations are a table lookup via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, a semaphore destroy call (sem_destroy), and simple pointer dereference/assignment. Therefore there is nothing in this code that could violate the rule prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
