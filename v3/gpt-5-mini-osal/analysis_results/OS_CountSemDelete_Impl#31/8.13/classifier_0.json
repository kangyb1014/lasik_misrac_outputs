  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. In the shown usage there is no violation: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET yields a pointer to a mutable OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t in the global table (OS_impl_count_sem_table) and the caller (OS_CountSemDelete_Impl) needs a mutable record to call sem_destroy(&impl->id) which modifies the semaphore. Making the returned pointer const would prevent required modification, so Rule 8.13 (\u201cpointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d) is not violated here. (Note: a potential violation would occur if the table and its uses were purely read-only \u2014 in that case the table elements and the macro should be const-qualified \u2014 or if the macro suppressed a const qualifier when passing a const token to a callee that expects a non-const pointer.)"
