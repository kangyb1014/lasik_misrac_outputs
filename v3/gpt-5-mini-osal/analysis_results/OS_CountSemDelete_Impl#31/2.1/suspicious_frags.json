  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function or related definitions. Reasoning:\n- The function has two return paths: one inside the if (sem_destroy(...) < 0) branch and one after it; both are potentially reachable depending on the runtime result of sem_destroy, so there is no statically unreachable statement.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an address expression that dereferences the token-derived index; this is a normal lookup and does not introduce dead/unreachable code. The inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and is reachable when the macro is evaluated.\n- There are no unconditional infinite loops, goto jumps, or return statements followed by code in the same block that would make subsequent statements unreachable.\n- Potential runtime issues (null pointer dereference, invalid index, or sem_destroy semantics) are not violations of MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) and therefore do not require investigation under this rule.\n\nFor the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code), no fragments in the supplied code need further investigation."
