  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions appears in this snippet. The code only declares a pointer, obtains an object via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, calls sem_destroy, and returns status codes. None of these lines invoke memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string handling function covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only macro call (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) and the impl->id usage could potentially hide other operations, but based on the provided code there is no direct string handling to inspect; therefore, no fragments in this snippet are relevant to Rule 21.17."
