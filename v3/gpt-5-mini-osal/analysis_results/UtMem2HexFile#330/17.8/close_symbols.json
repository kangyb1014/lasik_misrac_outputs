  "explanation": "To determine whether UtMem2HexFile violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" you must be able to rule out any direct or indirect modification of the function parameters (Memory, Filename, Length). The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- fopen: Declared as fopen(Filename, ...). Confirming its prototype shows it takes a const char * by value (it cannot change the caller's Filename pointer). Ensure no macro override or wrapper exists that might write into Filename (e.g. by taking &Filename).\n\n- fprintf: Used repeatedly with both Filename-derived values and Memory contents. Confirm fprintf's prototype takes pointer arguments by value; verify no project-specific redefinition that would accept pointer-to-pointer and thus could modify a parameter variable.\n\n- fclose: Called on local FILE *fp; include to confirm it cannot (via macro) modify function parameters.\n\n- printf: Used in the error path with Filename and strerror(errno). Confirm prototype and that no macro wrapper modifies Filename.\n\n- strerror: Provides the error string; include to ensure it doesn't cause any side-effect that could alter Filename or other parameters.\n\n- errno: Included because strerror(errno) is used; include to check whether any project-specific usage could alias parameter storage (very unlikely but required to rule out indirect modification).\n\n- isprint: Used on bytes read via (uint8 *)Memory. Include to ensure it is a standard function/macro that does not modify Memory or the pointer.\n\n- UtAssert_True: Called in the error path. Include its declaration/definition to ensure that this assertion macro/function does not modify any of the function parameters (e.g., by taking their addresses). Even if UtAssert_True is not in the static call graph, the source calls it; many projects implement it as a macro that could reference/modify globals or parameters.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph as a callee related to assertion infrastructure. Include to ensure assertion helpers do not indirectly modify the parameters (for example via weird macros that take addresses of local parameters).\n\n- uint8 and uint32: The typedefs for these integer types are required to confirm they are plain integer typedefs (not e.g. macros/structs) and to verify that the cast (uint8 *)Memory is a simple pointer cast rather than invoking an operator or macro that could modify Memory.\n\n- FILE: The FILE type definition is needed to ensure no project-specific redefinition (macro or unusual type) that could cause parameter aliasing or modification.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule violation would occur if the function assigns to any of its parameter variables (Memory, Filename, Length) or if an invoked macro/function has the side-effect of modifying those parameter variables (for example by taking their address). The listed symbols cover all called functions/macros and the relevant types so the next analyst can inspect their declarations/definitions to ensure none can alter the parameter variables or their storage."
