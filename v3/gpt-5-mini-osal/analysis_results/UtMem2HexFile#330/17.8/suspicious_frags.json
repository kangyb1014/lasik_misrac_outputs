  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- Memory, Filename, and Length are only read; there are no assignments (e.g., Memory = ..., Filename = ..., Length = ...) or increments/decrements applied to these parameters.\n- The code uses ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j] only to read bytes; the pointer parameter Memory itself is not reassigned or modified. Although the code casts away the const qualifier (casting to uint8 *), it does not alter the pointer parameter variable or write through the resulting pointer \u2014 this is not a modification of the parameter itself (but may be relevant to other MISRA rules such as casting away const).\n- Filename is passed to fopen and used in fprintf/printf but is not modified.\n- Length is used as a loop bound and is not changed.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function; no code fragments require investigation under that specific rule."
