  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because they do not remove const qualification or create non-const pointers to memory that is passed as const. The function parameters are already declared with const where appropriate (const void *Memory, const char *Filename). Calls to fopen, fprintf, fclose, printf, strerror, and UtAssert_True do not perform casts that change const qualification. There are no other pointer casts or pointer assignments in the function aside from the listed fragments, and integer arithmetic/indexing operations do not affect pointer constness. Therefore only the listed lines (which perform casts from const-qualified Memory to a non-const uint8 * via (uint8 *)Memory) require investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
