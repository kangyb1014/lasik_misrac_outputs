  "explanation": "I selected all call sites inside UtMem2HexFile (standard library I/O and string/error routines, the isprint call, and the UtAssert_True macro invocation) because any of those functions could, in principle, invoke application code that leads back to UtMem2HexFile and create indirect recursion; they therefore warrant investigation. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: variable declarations (FILE * fp; uint32 i; uint32 j;), loop constructs (for (...) { ... }), pointer casts and indexing (((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]), arithmetic and comparisons ((i + j) < Length), format string literals, and the return statements do not themselves represent function calls and cannot cause direct or indirect self-calls. Additionally, the provided UtAssert_GetContext implementation is a simple accessor returning DefaultContext and does not call UtMem2HexFile, so it does not need further investigation."
