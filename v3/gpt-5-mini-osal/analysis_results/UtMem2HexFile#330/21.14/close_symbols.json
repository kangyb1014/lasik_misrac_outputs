  "explanation": "For verifying whether UtMem2HexFile (or any of its callees) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect every function that UtMem2HexFile may invoke (directly or indirectly) and any library routines it relies on that could perform string comparisons. Each symbol is required for the following reason:\n\n- UtAssert_True: Called directly in the error path. Its implementation may perform message formatting or internal string comparisons; it could (incorrectly) use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph as a callee related to the UtAssert family. Even if it does not currently call memcmp, you must inspect it because it is part of the assertion infrastructure invoked by this function.\n- UtAssert: The top-level assertion facility (may be a macro or function) that ties into UtAssert_True/GetContext; include it to check for any string comparisons in the assertion helpers.\n- fopen: Standard library file-open routine used by this function. Some platform-specific implementations may call internal string-comparison helpers; include it to be thorough when checking for memcmp usage in code paths reachable from UtMem2HexFile.\n- fprintf: Used heavily for output formatting. Implementation or wrappers might perform string handling that could use memcmp; inspect to ensure no memcmp-on-NT-string occurs in reachable formatting code.\n- fclose: File-close routine; include to ensure no reachable code path uses memcmp in cleanup.\n- printf: Used in the error path. Like fprintf, formatting or wrapper layers might use string-comparison routines; include it for completeness.\n- strerror: Returns error message strings and may perform lookups or comparisons; its implementation could use memcmp or similar functions \u2014 inspect to ensure it does not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n- errno: The global error number used by strerror/printf; include to understand error-reporting code paths and implementations that might perform string comparisons.\n- isprint: Character-class test used on bytes from Memory. Include its definition/implementation if non-standard or wrapped in the codebase, to ensure it does not internally use memcmp on C-strings.\n\nNote: The standard library functions are generally safe on most platforms, but to satisfy a MISRA-focused analysis you must either verify the platform implementations (or wrappers used in the project) or exclude them from the analysis. The primary focus should be the project-specific assertion functions (UtAssert_True/UtAssert_GetContext/UtAssert) because those are the most likely places within the codebase to contain memcmp misuse on null-terminated strings."
