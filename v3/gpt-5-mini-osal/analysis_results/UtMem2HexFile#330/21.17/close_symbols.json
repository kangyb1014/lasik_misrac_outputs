  "explanation": "List of symbols the analyzer will need and why:\n\n- strerror (string.h): This is a standard string-handling function declared in <string.h>. The MISRA rule targets use of <string.h> functions; even though UtMem2HexFile only calls strerror, the analyzer must know its signature/behavior (char *strerror(int)) to decide whether its use could cause out-of-bounds string accesses or rely on buffers external to this function.\n\n- errno (errno.h): errno is passed to strerror. The analyzer needs its type and semantics (range of values) to reason about the strerror call and any potential indirect string-buffer accesses that could result.\n\n- fopen, fprintf, fclose, printf (stdio.h): These I/O functions are called by UtMem2HexFile. While not in <string.h>, their prototypes and side-effects matter for understanding whether any string operations (formatting, internal buffering) could produce accesses beyond provided buffers or rely on string functions internally. Knowing their signatures also helps confirm that no string.h functions are being indirectly misused via formatting.\n\n- isprint (ctype.h): Used to select printable characters from Memory. The analyzer should know its prototype/expected input range to ensure the call cannot invoke undefined behaviour (e.g., passing negative values) that could interact with any string handling.\n\n- UtAssert_True: External assertion function called on error path. Its implementation could use string functions internally (e.g., format/assert message handling). The analyzer needs to know whether that call might invoke any <string.h> functions with pointers originating in this function.\n\n- FILE (stdio.h): The FILE type is used for file operations; knowing its type/semantics is necessary to reason about the lifetime of the file stream and any buffers related to fprintf/fclose that could be related to string handling.\n\n- uint32, uint8 (project typedefs): The exact definitions (width, unsignedness) are required to reason about indexing arithmetic i + j, loop bounds, and potential integer overflow/wrap which could cause out-of-bounds memory accesses when indexing ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]. Determining compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule requires knowing these types' sizes and semantics.\n\nIn short: strerror and errno are the only direct <string.h>-related symbols here, but to confidently decide MISRA compliance you must also know the I/O, character-classification, assertion, FILE type, and the precise integer typedefs used for indexing and bounds checks."
