  "explanation": "To decide whether any operation in OS_FileStat_Impl is dead code (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know the exact semantics, constants and initialization state that determine which branches and assignments can ever affect program state or outputs. For each symbol:\n\n- stat: determines whether the early return (when stat fails) can ever occur and controls the remainder being reachable; also defines how st members are populated.\n- struct stat (st_size, st_mtim, st_mtime, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid): needed to know which fields exist, their types/values and whether tests (S_ISDIR, uid/gid/mode checks) can ever be true/false; this affects whether subsequent assignments/bit-sets are meaningful.\n- struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec): required to know how FileTime is assembled and whether nanosecond resolution path is used; influences whether the OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds call is necessary.\n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE: preprocessor feature macros decide whether st.st_mtim (timespec) is available or fallback to st_mtime is used; this changes the compiled code path and whether the timespec copy is meaningful.\n- S_ISDIR, S_IFMT, S_IFDIR: determine how the directory test is computed; if the macros or st_mode semantics make this test always false/true, the FileModeBits |= OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR may be dead/redundant.\n- Permission bit macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): these constants control the read/write/exec mask construction. If their values or OS_IMPL_SELF_* logic make some tests always true/false, the corresponding if-blocks may be dead.\n- mode_t, uid_t, gid_t: types for st_mode/st_uid/st_gid/mask operations \u2014 needed to check for truncation/implicit conversions that could make tests vacuous.\n- os_fstat_t (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits): definition and semantics (especially whether FileModeBits is guaranteed zeroed by the caller) are needed to tell if the |= operations change observable state; if FileModeBits is already set or never observed, those operations could be dead.\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: target flags used in FileModeBits; their bit values are needed to reason about whether |= actually changes FileStats.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: values (compile-time constants or dynamic values) determine whether user/group bits are ORed into the read/write/exec masks. If these macros are set such that the ORs are no-ops (e.g. equal to a value that cannot match st_uid/st_gid), some branches become dead.\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: called to compute FileTime; must know if it has side effects or is a pure assembler function. If it is pure and its result is unused elsewhere, or if it always returns a constant for given inputs, replacing/removing it may or may not change behaviour.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: return values used by callers; needed to determine whether removing early returns or changing assignment order would alter observable return semantics.\n- OS_stat (caller) \u2014 how FileStats is allocated/initialized: the comment says the caller zeroes fst_mode, but to determine if the |= operations are necessary you must inspect the caller(s) to confirm FileStats->FileModeBits initial state and whether other callers rely on individual bit writes. Also must verify if the caller ignores FileModeBits (which would make the writes dead).\n\nIn short, these symbols supply the constants, types, initial conditions, feature-selection and side-effect information required to prove whether each assignment, mask construction, branch and call in OS_FileStat_Impl can influence externally observable behaviour (return value, FileStats contents) \u2014 the necessary information to decide if any operation is dead code under the MISRA rule."
