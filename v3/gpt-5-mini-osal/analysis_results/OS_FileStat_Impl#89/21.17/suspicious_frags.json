  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule concerns calls to the <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). In the provided OS_FileStat_Impl function body there are no uses of any <string.h> routines \u2014 only stat(), field assignments, time assembly, and bitmask checks, none of which involve string.h buffer access. The OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds inline function and the other shown lines (assigning FileSize, FileModeBits, etc.) likewise do not call string.h functions. The three fragments reported are the only places in the supplied code that either directly call a string.h function (memset) or involve a fixed-size character buffer and a path-copying helper (local_path and OS_TranslatePath) that could internally use string functions and therefore warrant investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
