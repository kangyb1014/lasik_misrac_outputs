  "explanation": "For assessing compliance with the MISRA C rule about use of <string.h> functions, the next analyzer must be able to prove that neither this function nor any called/wrapped functions perform string.h operations that could access out-of-bounds memory. Provide the following symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: Called by the target function; must be inspected to ensure it does not call any string.h routines (e.g., strcpy/strlen) or otherwise access character buffers.\n- stat: The POSIX/system stat() call is passed the local_path string; include its declaration/semantics to confirm it does not imply any local use of string.h functions in this translation unit and to understand expectations for the path argument.\n- OS_stat: Some builds use an OS wrapper for stat (seen in the call graph). If present, inspect this wrapper to ensure it does not call string.h functions on the path or other buffers before/after delegating to stat.\n- os_fstat_t: Definition of the FileStats type (fields and sizes) to ensure that assignments/bitwise operations in this function are not hiding any string operations and to verify there are no embedded character buffers that might be manipulated by other called functions.\n- struct stat: Definition of struct stat (members used: st_size, st_mtime or st_mtim, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid) to confirm no hidden character-array members are being accessed here and to understand the types used.\n- struct timespec: Definition (tv_sec, tv_nsec) to verify assembly of time and ensure no string operations are performed while handling time values.\n- mode_t: Typedef for file mode bits to validate bitwise operations and ensure no implicit casts cause buffer/size issues related to string ops.\n- S_ISDIR: Macro used to test st_mode; include it to confirm it is a simple bit test and not a wrapper invoking string routines.\n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP: Permission macros used to construct readbits/writebits/execbits; include them to ensure they are simple bit constants (no functions that could call string.h routines).\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: FileStats flag values written by this function; include to verify they are simple integer masks and that no setter functions/macros invoked perform string operations.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: Values compared to st.st_uid/st_gid; include to ensure they are simple constants/macros (no hidden string usage) and to confirm ownership logic does not call string functions.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: Return-code constants used by the function; include to ensure there are no wrapper semantics that involve string handling when mapping or logging these codes.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations/definitions/implementations where applicable) lets the next agent check all direct callees and any macros/wrappers for uses of the standard string.h functions named in the MISRA rule, and thereby determine whether any out-of-bounds string accesses can occur as a result of this function's implementation or the functions/macros it relies on."
