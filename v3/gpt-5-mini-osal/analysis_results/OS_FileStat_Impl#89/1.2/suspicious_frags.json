  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided code. I checked for common extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, including but not limited to: GCC/Clang attributes or __attribute__ usage, asm/inline assembly, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values or computed gotos, compiler builtins with __builtin_*, named sections, or other vendor-specific keywords (e.g. __extension__, __inline__ when nonstandard). The code uses standard C and POSIX APIs/types (struct stat, struct timespec, mode_t, S_ISDIR, S_IRUSR, etc.) and guards use of st.st_mtim with feature-test macro checks (_POSIX_C_SOURCE/_XOPEN_SOURCE), which is a portable conditional compilation technique rather than a language extension. The use of inline in the additional code is standard C99 inline. Identifiers like int32, int64, uint32, OS_TIME_TICKS_PER_SECOND, and OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID appear to be project typedefs/macros or POSIX types (uid_t/gid_t) rather than compiler extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
