  "explanation": "I included all places where function calls occur (or could indirectly participate in a call graph) that need to be checked for possible direct or indirect recursion: the definition of OS_FileStat_Impl and its call sites (the POSIX stat() call and the OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds call), the inline OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds implementation, and the wrapper OS_stat which calls OS_FileStat_Impl (including its call to OS_TranslatePath and the parameter-check macro). Other fragments in the function (bitmask constants, S_ISDIR, assignments to FileStats members, read/write/exec bit computations, and simple return statements) are purely local operations or macro/constant uses that do not perform function calls and therefore cannot create a recursive call chain per Rule 17.2; they do not need further investigation for recursion. If any of the listed macros or of OS_TranslatePath (or any other called function) is implemented elsewhere, those implementations should be inspected as part of the investigation to ensure they do not call back into OS_stat or OS_FileStat_Impl."
