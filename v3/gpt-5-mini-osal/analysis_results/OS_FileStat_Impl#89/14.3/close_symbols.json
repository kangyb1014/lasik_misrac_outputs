  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in OS_FileStat_Impl is invariant you must know the exact semantics and values of the macros, types and struct members used in those expressions. Specifically:\n\n- stat and struct stat: the first if tests (stat(local_path, &st) < 0). You need the prototype/semantics of stat and the definition of struct stat (fields st_mode, st_uid, st_gid, st_size, st_mtime/st_mtim) to know whether the call result and the inspected fields are dependent on runtime information or could be folded to a constant.\n\n- S_ISDIR, S_IFMT, S_IFDIR: S_ISDIR is the controlling expression in if (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)). Its expansion and the constants S_IFMT/S_IFDIR determine whether that expression could be constant for given st_mode values; the macro semantics are required to determine possible invariance.\n\n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP and mode_t: These bit\u2011mask macros and the mode_t type are used to compute readbits/writebits/execbits and to test (st.st_mode & readbits) etc. You must know their numeric values and types to determine if the bit tests can be compile\u2011time or run\u2011time invariants (for example, if all masks were zero or if ORing with user/group bits is a no\u2011op).\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID and uid_t/gid_t: The comparisons if (OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID == st.st_uid) and if (OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID == st.st_gid) depend on the values (or definitions) of OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID/EGID and the types of st_uid/st_gid. If those OS_IMPL_* symbols are fixed special values (or defined in a way that makes the comparison always true/false), the controlling expressions could be invariant. Knowing their definitions is required.\n\n- os_fstat_t and OS_FILESTAT_MODE_* flags: While these are not directly part of the controlling expressions, their definitions (FileModeBits, and the OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR/READ/WRITE/EXEC flag values) are needed to understand the effect of the conditional branches and to confirm any assumptions in the caller comment (e.g. that FileModeBits starts zero). This helps rule out hidden invariance caused by pre-initialized flags or contradictory definitions.\n\nIn short, evaluating MISRA C \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" for the if statements in this function requires the exact macro expansions and constant values for the mode/permission macros, the OS_IMPL_SELF_* definitions, and the struct/type definitions used in the comparisons and bit tests."
