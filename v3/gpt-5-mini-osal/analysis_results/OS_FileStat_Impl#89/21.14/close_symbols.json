  "explanation": "Each listed symbol can affect whether the target function (or things it directly invokes) uses memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings: \n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: called by the target; must be inspected because it could internally call memcmp (or other string-compare utilities) that would make the overall call chain violate the MISRA rule. \n- stat: the libc/system call used for file information; its implementation or any wrapper could call string-compare routines on the provided path. Verify it does not use memcmp for NUL-terminated strings. \n- struct stat (st_mtim, st_mtime, st_size, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid): the fields accessed by the target; needed to see if any macros or accessors expand to code that might use memcmp. \n- struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec): used to assemble FileTime; included to inspect any inline helpers or macros that might perform string comparisons. \n- S_ISDIR and permission macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): these are macros that expand from st_mode; inspect their definitions to ensure they do not hide string comparisons (unlikely but necessary to be thorough). \n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: platform-specific constants compared to st_uid/st_gid; include to confirm no string-based comparison wrappers are involved. \n- os_fstat_t and its members (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits): the destination structure; inspect any accessor macros or inline functions that might perform string comparisons when setting or masking these fields. \n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_* constants (DIR, READ, WRITE, EXEC): bitmask constants used to set FileModeBits; include to check for any non-trivial definitions. \n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: return codes used by the function; include for completeness in analyzing any return-path helper macros or wrappers.\n\nThe aim is to provide the next analyzer all symbols that could either directly invoke memcmp or could expand (via macros/wrappers) into code that does string comparisons on NUL\u2011terminated strings."
