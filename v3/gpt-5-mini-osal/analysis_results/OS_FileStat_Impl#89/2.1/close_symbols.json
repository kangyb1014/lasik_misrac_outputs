  "explanation": "To determine whether any part of OS_FileStat_Impl is unreachable you must know all compile-time and run-time conditions that control flow and any symbols that could make branches impossible or dead. Brief rationales:\n\n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE: control which #if branch is compiled (st.st_mtim vs st.st_mtime). If project configuration forces one branch, the other is compile-time unreachable.\n\n- struct stat (definition including st_mode, st_size, st_uid, st_gid, st_mtime, st_mtim): needed to know which members exist (presence of st_mtim) and the semantics of st_mode/st_uid/st_gid used in the runtime condition checks. If fields or types differ, code paths could be invalid or unreachable.\n\n- stat (declaration/implementation): the early-return (stat < 0) is a runtime branch. Knowing the implementation/contract of stat (or any wrapper) is required to assess whether the error path can actually occur in the project context.\n\n- S_ISDIR: macro used to test st_mode; needed to determine whether the directory branch can be reached or is trivially false/true for the platform/definitions.\n\n- Permission mask macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): these masks define the bits tested on st_mode. If any mask is defined as zero or overlaps unexpectedly, the associated read/write/exec branches might be effectively dead.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: these are compared to st.st_uid/st_gid; if they are compile-time constants that cannot equal file owners in the target environment, the blocks that augment readbits/writebits/execbits could be unreachable (or vice versa).\n\n- os_fstat_t (definition and any caller initialization semantics): the function comments state the caller zeroes FileModeBits; to reason about dead stores or unreachable effects you must know the layout and whether writes to FileModeBits have any effect (e.g., if macros map to no-op or if the field is absent).\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: these macros/enum values determine what the code is actually doing when it sets FileModeBits. If any are defined as zero or duplicate, branches that set them might be pointless / render code unreachable from the viewpoint of observable behavior.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds (prototype/definition): although a simple call, its presence/side-effects and return type matter for flow analysis; also if it is a macro that expands to something affecting control flow, that can change reachability.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: return values used on early-failure and success; needed to determine whether certain return paths are meaningful in the project's error-handling model (and whether any subsequent code after a return is unreachable).\n\nTogether these symbols determine which blocks are compiled, which branches can be taken at runtime, whether assignments are observable, and whether any statements are dead/unreachable for the MISRA C unreachable-code analysis."
