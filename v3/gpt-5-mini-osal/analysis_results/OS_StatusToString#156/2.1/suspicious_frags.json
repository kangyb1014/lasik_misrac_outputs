    "if (status_string != NULL)\n    {\n        snprintf(*status_string, sizeof(*status_string), \"%ld\", OS_StatusToInteger(status));\n        string = *status_string;\n    }",

  "explanation": "The variable declaration (char *string = NULL;) and the final return (return string;) are simple, reachable statements and do not on their own indicate unreachable code, so they do not require investigation. There is no code after the return that could be dead, and no obvious unconditional jumps or infinite loops that would make subsequent statements unreachable. The only places that could conceal unreachable-code issues in this function are the conditional block and its statements (the if test and its body) because their execution depends on the value and the underlying typedef/representation of status_string and on the behavior of OS_StatusToInteger; therefore those fragments are reported for investigation."
