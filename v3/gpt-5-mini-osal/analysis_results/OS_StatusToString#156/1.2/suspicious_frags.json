  "explanation": "Only constructs that might rely on non-standard, compiler-provided language extensions are reported. The remaining code fragments use standard C language features: typedef of a character array (typedef char os_status_string_t[OS_STATUS_STRING_LENGTH]) is valid C; use of snprintf, sizeof, array-to-pointer decay via *status_string, the cast (long)Status, the format specifier \"%ld\", and the return of a char* are all standard C and do not by themselves indicate a compiler language extension. Therefore they do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
