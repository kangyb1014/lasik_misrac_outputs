  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_StatusToString:\n```c\nchar *OS_StatusToString(osal_status_t status, os_status_string_t *status_string)\n{\n    char *string = NULL;\n\n    if (status_string != NULL)\n    {\n        snprintf(*status_string, sizeof(*status_string), \"%ld\", OS_StatusToInteger(status));\n        string = *status_string;\n    }\n    return string;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_StatusToString:\nstatic inline long OS_StatusToInteger(osal_status_t Status)\n{\n    return (long)Status;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsnprintf(*status_string, sizeof(*status_string), \"%ld\", OS_StatusToInteger(status));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The snprintf call produces an observable side-effect by writing the textual representation of `status` into the caller-provided buffer `*status_string` and the function returns that buffer pointer. Removing the snprintf would change program behaviour whenever the caller reads the buffer contents or uses the returned string. (Only a whole-project analysis could show a specific case where the buffer contents are never used, which would be a project-level dead-code determination; that cannot be concluded from this fragment.)"
