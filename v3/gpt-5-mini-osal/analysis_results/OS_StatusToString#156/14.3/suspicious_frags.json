  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The only control statement is\n- if (status_string != NULL)\nwhich depends on the function parameter and is not a compile-time constant, so it is not an invariant controlling expression. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements with constant expressions. The do-while/infinite-loop exceptions to Rule 14.3 are not applicable. Other expressions (for example sizeof(*status_string)) are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3, so there are no code fragments that need further investigation for this rule."
