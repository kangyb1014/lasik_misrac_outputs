  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter itself. The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and there is no assignment to token (no token = ...), no increment/decrement, no taking of its address for modification, and no const cast that would allow modifying the pointer. The only use of the parameter is dereferencing (*token) to read its value for the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro; reading the object referred to by the pointer is permitted and does not violate Rule 17.8. The call to pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mut) operates on a member of impl and does not modify the token parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
