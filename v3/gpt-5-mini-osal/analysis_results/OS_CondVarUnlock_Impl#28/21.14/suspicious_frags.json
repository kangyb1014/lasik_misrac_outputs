  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided code (OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl function body and the related type/array definitions). None of the fragments contain any call to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any other string comparison of null-terminated strings. The function only calls pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mut) and returns OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR. The related definitions show an array of OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t and that the record contains pthread types (pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t) \u2014 no character arrays or string operations are present. The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx (no string comparison). Therefore there are no occurrences of memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings in the provided code. (If OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or the full definition of OS_object_token_t are defined elsewhere, those definitions would need to be checked, but they are not part of the supplied code.)"
