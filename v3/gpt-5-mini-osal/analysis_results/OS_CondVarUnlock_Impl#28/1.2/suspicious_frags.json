  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function and related symbols use standard C constructs and POSIX APIs (pthread types and functions), standard typedefs (int32_t), and ordinary macros. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific language features that compiler documentation would mark as extensions. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET uses the address-of operator on the macro parameter (&(tok)) which can be risky if the actual argument has side effects, but that is not a compiler language extension and thus is not reportable under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
