  "explanation": "All other pointer uses in this function either already have appropriate const qualification or are used to modify the pointed-to data and therefore should not be const. Specifically:\n- The parameter TypeName is already declared as const char * (appropriate for read-only string data).\n- The local pointer declaration UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr is used to modify the stub entry fields (FuncKey, EntryType, Data, ModeFlags), so it must be a non-const pointer to allow mutation.\n- The buffer pointer assignment StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr = malloc(ReturnSize) and the subsequent memset(StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr, 0, ReturnSize) indicate the buffer is intended to be writable, so BasePtr must not be const-qualified.\n- Calls to UT_GetStubEntry return a mutable entry that is subsequently modified (cleared, reinitialized), so returning a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate here.\nTherefore, the only fragment that may violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is the assignment of the const-qualified TypeName to the ContentTypeStr field \u2014 this suggests ContentTypeStr might be declared as a non-const char * and should be reviewed to determine if it should instead be const char * to preserve the const qualification."
