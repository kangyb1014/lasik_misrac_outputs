  "explanation": "I inspected OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew and the related routines (OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_NotifyEvent). No function parameter variables are being reassigned (e.g., there are no statements like 'token = ...', 'outid = ...', or 'operation_status = ...'). The only modifications are to objects referenced by pointer parameters, which MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits (for example, token->lock_mode is updated in OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, record->active_id is updated there, and *outid is written in OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew). Also, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish takes final_id as a pointer to const osal_id_t, and that pointer itself is not modified. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation under this rule."
