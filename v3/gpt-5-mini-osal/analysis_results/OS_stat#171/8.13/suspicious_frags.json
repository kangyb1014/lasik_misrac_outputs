  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce non-const-qualified pointer targets or already use const where appropriate. Specifically: the parameter 'path' is declared as 'const char *' (already const-qualified); 'return_code' is an integer, not a pointer; the typedef for 'os_fstat_t' defines a struct type (no pointer-to-non-const to evaluate here). The listed fragments cover all places in this function where non-const pointer targets are declared, passed, or manipulated and therefore should be reviewed to determine whether a const qualification is possible or intended."
