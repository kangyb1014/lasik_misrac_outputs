  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions that may access beyond object bounds. In this function the only direct string.h call is memset, which should be checked to ensure filestats points to an object at least sizeof(*filestats) bytes long (OS_CHECK_POINTER appears to check only for NULL). The local_path buffer and the calls that pass it or path to other routines (OS_TranslatePath and OS_FileStat_Impl) are flagged because those callee implementations commonly use string.h routines (e.g., strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strlen) and could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses either by writing past local_path or by reading/writing via path. Other fragments in the function (variable declarations, return_code handling, the final return, and the OS_CHECK_POINTER invocation itself) do not directly invoke string.h functions or do not perform memory writes that could trigger the rule, so they do not need further investigation under Rule 21.17."
