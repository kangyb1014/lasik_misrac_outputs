  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl contains no calls to memcmp, no string handling, and no operations that treat any object as a null-terminated C string. The object_ids member is a fixed-size byte array used as a bitfield (bit shifts, masks, and >>=), and FD_ISSET/OS_impl_filehandle_table accesses relate to file descriptors, not string comparison. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
