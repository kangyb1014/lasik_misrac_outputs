  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion, the call\u2011graph around it must be examined for cycles back to the target. The required symbols are:\n\n- OS_SelectMultiple_Impl: This function is a direct caller of OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl (per the provided graph). Its body must be inspected to see if it (or anything it calls) can call OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl again or otherwise form a cycle.\n\n- OS_SelectMultiple: Listed as a caller of OS_SelectMultiple_Impl. It must be checked because recursion could occur via higher\u2011level callers that form a cycle back into OS_SelectMultiple_Impl or OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl.\n\n- OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl: A callee of OS_SelectMultiple_Impl. It must be examined because it could call back to OS_SelectMultiple_Impl or OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl, creating indirect recursion.\n\n- OS_DoSelect: Another callee of OS_SelectMultiple_Impl. Likewise it must be checked for any calls that could lead back to OS_SelectMultiple_Impl or OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl.\n\nIn short, these symbols cover the immediate caller (OS_SelectMultiple_Impl), its caller, and its immediate callees \u2014 i.e., the local call neighborhood needed to detect any cycle that would violate the MISRA rule. If those functions call other functions, their callees would also need to be included (transitive closure) until no new functions are reachable."
