  "explanation": "For checking whether this function violates the MISRA rule about modifying a function parameter you must know whether any pointer parameters themselves are being modified (or modified indirectly via macros) versus only the objects they point to. Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- OS_FdSet: the struct layout (type and size of object_ids) is needed to confirm that OSAL_set->object_ids[...] indexes into and modifies the pointee object (allowed) rather than reassigning the pointer parameter itself. The element type determines whether &= modifies an object or would be illegal.\n- fd_set: the concrete definition is needed to see whether operations on OS_set (the pointer parameter) could be modifying the pointer or its internals in a way that conflicts with the rule.\n- FD_ISSET: this macro/function is used with OS_set; its definition must be checked for side effects (e.g., if it were implemented in an unexpected way that modified its first argument) to ensure the pointer parameter is not being modified.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: the global table is read here; its declaration/definition is needed to see what is being accessed and whether that access could modify OS_set or OSAL_set indirectly.\n- type of OS_impl_filehandle_table elements (struct with member fd): to confirm that accessing .fd is a simple read of an int (or similar) and has no side effects that would modify pointer parameters.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: the constant is used in the conditional; understanding its value/range is necessary to reason about the conditional path that leads to modification of OSAL_set->object_ids.\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: this macro/function converts an index to osal_index_t; its expansion must be inspected to ensure it has no side effects that modify parameters (or other objects) and that it yields the intended id value.\n- osal_index_t: the typedef is needed to understand the comparison and whether id is an ordinary scalar (no unexpected side effects).\n- uint8: the typedef for objids and object_ids elements is needed to verify the bitwise operations (shifts, &=) operate on object memory rather than on pointer parameters.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine whether any pointer parameter variable (OS_set or OSAL_set) is assigned to or otherwise modified (which would violate MISRA) versus only the objects they point to being modified (which is permitted)."
