  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is reassigned or modified in this code. The parameters are fd_set *OS_set and OS_FdSet *OSAL_set; the code does not assign to OS_set or OSAL_set themselves (no statements like OS_set = ... or OSAL_set = ...). The only write to data related to a parameter is OSAL_set->object_ids[offset] &= ~(1 << bit); \u2014 this modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter, which is explicitly allowed by Rule 17.8. All other mutations are to local variables (objids, bit, offset, id, osfd) or are reads (FD_ISSET uses OS_set read-only). Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation for this rule."
