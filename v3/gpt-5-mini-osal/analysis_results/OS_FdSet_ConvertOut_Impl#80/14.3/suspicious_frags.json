  "explanation": "The remaining control expressions and conditions in the function do not need investigation for Rule 14.3 because they depend on modifiable or runtime values and therefore are not invariant: - The if condition ((objids & 0x01) != 0 && id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) depends on objids and id which are computed per-iteration. - The nested check if (osfd < 0 || !FD_ISSET(osfd, OS_set)) depends on osfd and the FD_ISSET runtime evaluation. - The updates ++bit and objids >>= 1 modify loop state used by the controlling expressions. None of these other expressions are constant/invariant compile-time values, so they do not prima facie violate Rule 14.3."
