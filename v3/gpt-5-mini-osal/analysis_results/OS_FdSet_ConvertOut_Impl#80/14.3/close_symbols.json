  "explanation": "To determine whether any controlling expression in OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl is invariant, the analyzer must know the exact definitions and semantics of every symbol that contributes to those expressions:\n\n- OS_FdSet: The for-loop limit uses sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids). The struct definition (particularly the object_ids member) is required to know the compile-time size and whether its type/qualifiers could affect invariance.\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids: The while-loop initialiser copies OSAL_set->object_ids[offset] into local objids and the loop body writes back to this array. Knowledge of the element type, array length, and qualifiers (e.g., volatile) is needed to determine whether the controlling expression might be affected by external changes or be a constant.\n- fd_set: FD_ISSET(osfd, OS_set) appears in a controlling expression. The fd_set type is needed to know how FD_ISSET reads state (and whether it has side-effects or depends on volatile storage).\n- FD_ISSET: Must know whether FD_ISSET is a pure read macro, a function, or has side effects; its semantics determine whether the condition involving FD_ISSET can change across iterations or be invariant.\n- osal_index_t: id is of this type; its width and signedness affect evaluation of comparisons (id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) and whether id can change the boolean outcome predictably.\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: This macro/function computes id from (offset * 8) + bit. Its definition is required to know whether id actually depends on offset/bit (and therefore varies) or if it could be invariant (e.g., if it folds to a constant or has side-effects).\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The inner if compares id to this constant; the numeric value is required to decide if id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES can be invariant for ranges of id values or if it changes with id.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: The code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd. The table definition (size, indexing behaviour, and whether it is volatile) is needed to decide whether fd values change across iterations or whether indexing could be out-of-bounds or constant.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd: The fd member type and any qualifiers are required to evaluate the expression (osfd < 0 || !FD_ISSET(...)) and to determine whether osfd can vary across loop iterations.\n- uint8: The local objids is of this typedef; knowing its width and signedness ensures correct reasoning about shifts, masking (objids & 0x01) and whether the while(condition) can be invariant due to integer promotions/truncation.\n\nWith these symbol definitions the next analyst can determine whether each controlling expression (the for condition offset < sizeof(...), the while condition objids != 0, and the if/inner if conditions) genuinely depends on variables that change across iterations or is invariant (and thus potentially a MISRA violation)."
