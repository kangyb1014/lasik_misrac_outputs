  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The only named parameter is 'Spec' (declared as const char *), and it is never assigned to, incremented, or otherwise changed. The uses of 'Spec' are: passed to va_start(Args, Spec) as the last named parameter (va_start does not modify the parameter itself), and passed to vsnprintf as the format string (a read-only use). The variadic arguments ('...') are not a named parameter and thus not subject to Rule 17.8 in the sense of modifying a named parameter. Other modifications in the function (incrementing the static TextIndex and writing into the static buffer Buf) do not affect any function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
