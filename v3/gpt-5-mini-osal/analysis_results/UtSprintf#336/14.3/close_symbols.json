  "explanation": "UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: need the definition (value and whether it is a compile-time constant) to determine whether the controlling expression (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS) can be invariant (for example, if it equals 0 the test would be always true). UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: need the type definition (in particular the size/shape of the Text member and any constraints on the buffer array) to relate the buffer array length to UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS and to confirm whether BUFs/counts/indices make the conditional meaningful. uint32: need the typedef details (signedness, width and any qualifiers such as const/volatile) used for TextIndex to know how increments and comparisons behave (e.g. wrap/overflow semantics, whether TextIndex could be effectively invariant due to qualifiers). These symbols are required to decide if the if-condition is truly invariant and thus if the MISRA rule is violated."
