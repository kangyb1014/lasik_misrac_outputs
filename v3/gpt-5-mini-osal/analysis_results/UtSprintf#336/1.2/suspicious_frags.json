  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragments. The function uses standard C features only: variadic arguments (va_list, va_start, va_end), the standard library call vsnprintf, static local storage, macros for sizes, and a typedef alias for a fixed-width integer (uint32 from uint32_t). There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
