  "explanation": "To decide whether UtSprintf uses any compiler language extension you must examine the definitions/declarations of the following symbols:\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t\n  - Reason: The struct/type defines the member Text used with sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text). If Text is declared as a zero-length array (char Text[0]) or uses compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__, packed, unnamed extension) that would be a language extension. If Text is a C99 flexible array member (char Text[]), behaviour of sizeof and use here must be checked against the applicable standard/MISRA interpretation.\n\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS\n  - Reason: This macro supplies the compile-time size of the static Buf array. If it is not an integer constant expression (for example derived from a non-constant expression or uses a compiler-specific extension), or if it resolves to 0, that may indicate non-standard/extension usage (or produce implementation-defined behaviour). You need its definition to confirm standard-compliant array sizing.\n\n- uint32\n  - Reason: The typedef or macro for uint32 must be inspected to determine whether it is a plain standard typedef (e.g. an alias for uint32_t) or a compiler/vendor extension type (e.g. a compiler-specific intrinsic or using non-standard keywords). MISRA\u2019s rule on language extensions requires knowing whether basic types are standard.\n\n- vsnprintf\n  - Reason: vsnprintf is a library function whose availability/semantics differ between C standards and some platforms provide non-standard equivalents (e.g. _vsnprintf). You must check its declaration/availability on the target platform to ensure the call is not relying on a non-standard/extended function.\n\n- va_list, va_start, va_end\n  - Reason: These are macros/typedefs from <stdarg.h>. Their definitions are implementation-provided; some compilers implement varargs using extensions or non-standard types/macros. Confirming their definitions ensures the va_list handling is standard and not using compiler-specific extensions.\n\nCollecting these definitions/declarations (type/struct definitions and relevant headers/macros) lets the next analyst determine if any non-standard language or compiler-specific extensions are used by UtSprintf."
