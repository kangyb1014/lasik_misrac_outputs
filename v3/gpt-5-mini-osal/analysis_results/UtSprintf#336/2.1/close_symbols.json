  "explanation": "- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: the compile-time constant that sizes the static Buf array and is used in the condition (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS). Its value (and type) determines whether the branch that resets TextIndex can ever be true or is always/never taken (e.g. 0 or 1 lead to different reachability conclusions).\\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: the typedef/structure of array elements Buf[...] is required to know the existence and layout of members (especially Text) and to validate indexing and sizeof usage; if the type is malformed or empty it could affect whether subsequent code is reachable/valid.\\n- (member) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t::Text: the declaration and size/type of the Text member are needed because sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text) is passed to vsnprintf and the return expression uses Buf[TextIndex].Text; its presence/definition affects whether those statements are meaningful and reachable.\\n- uint32: the exact typedef/type of TextIndex (width, signedness) is needed to reason about the ++TextIndex increment, wrap/overflow behavior and whether the comparison with UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS can ever be true/false, which impacts reachability of the branch.\\n- vsnprintf: the prototype/attributes of vsnprintf (notably whether it is a normal returning function or has non\u2011returning attributes) are necessary to determine if execution continues past the call (i.e. whether subsequent code is reachable).\\n- va_list, va_start, va_end: the varargs types/macros from <stdarg.h> are required to ensure the va_start/va_end usage is well-formed and does not introduce control-flow behavior (e.g. macros that could expand to non-returning code in nonstandard environments).\\n\nThese symbols together allow a static analyst to determine if any conditional or subsequent statements in UtSprintf are unreachable under the actual macro/type/function definitions used in the project."
