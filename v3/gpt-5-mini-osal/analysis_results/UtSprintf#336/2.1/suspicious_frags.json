  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- All executable statements in UtSprintf are reachable during normal operation: the pre-increment (++TextIndex), the conditional wrap (if (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS) TextIndex = 0;), the va_start/vsnprintf/va_end sequence, and the return statement are all on the single execution path of the function and can be executed depending on runtime state.\n- The wrap branch is reachable when TextIndex increments from UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS-1 to UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS; with UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS defined as 10 this branch can occur.\n- The initial value TextIndex = 0 causes the first call to use buffer index 1 (0 is used after a full cycle), which is a logic choice but not unreachable code \u2014 index 0 becomes reachable after wrap-around.\n- There are no conditional-compilation constructs or constant-false conditions that would make portions of the code permanently unreachable, and there is no code appearing after a return or following an unconditional jump that would be unreachable.\n- The static Buf and TextIndex declarations are standard and reachable/usable; UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS is defined (10) so the array and indexing are valid (unless external changes alter that define, which is outside the provided code).\n\nTherefore, under the provided definitions, there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS were changed to an unexpected value (e.g., 0) or if other project-wide macros conditionally remove/alter code, a separate review of those changes would be warranted, but those situations are not present in the supplied code."
