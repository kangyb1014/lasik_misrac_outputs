  "explanation": "To determine whether UtSprintf violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls we must know what UtSprintf actually calls and whether any of those callees can (directly or indirectly) call UtSprintf back.\n\n- vsnprintf: This is the direct call inside UtSprintf. You must include its declaration/implementation or a complete static call graph for it to see whether it (or any functions it calls) can reach UtSprintf.\n\n- vfprintf / libc internal printf engine (__vfprintf_internal, __printf_engine, etc.): Many implementations of vsnprintf delegate to an internal vfprintf-like engine. Including these symbols (or their call graphs) is necessary because recursion could occur through these internal routines.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by vsnprintf / vfprintf (examples: vprintf, snprintf, printf family wrappers, internal format helpers, and low-level I/O functions such as putc/fwrite/write): The transitive closure of vsnprintf's callees must be examined to check for an indirect path back to UtSprintf. Provide implementations or call graphs for these symbols as well.\n\n- va_list, va_start, va_end: Include their definitions/macros to confirm they are not implemented as calls that could involve UtSprintf. Typically they are macros/ABI intrinsics and do not call functions, but this must be verified for the target environment.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (and its member Text): Include the type definition so the analyzer has the full symbol layout referenced by Buf[TextIndex].Text. (Not directly related to recursion, but needed to fully understand the buffer object that is being passed to vsnprintf and to rule out any unusual semantics.)\n\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: The macro value is needed to understand buffer indexing behavior (again not directly relevant to recursion but part of the function's context).\n\n- uint32 typedef: Provide the typedef so the analyzer can parse the declaration of TextIndex correctly.\n\nIn short: the critical symbol for recursion analysis is vsnprintf and its entire transitive call graph. The va_* macros and the UT_* type/macro definitions are included to ensure there are no non-obvious call paths or implementation-specific macros that introduce calls back to UtSprintf."
