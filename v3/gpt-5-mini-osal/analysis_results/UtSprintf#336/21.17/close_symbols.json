  "explanation": "UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (definition): The function indexes Buf[TextIndex].Text and uses sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text). You must know the struct definition and, specifically, the type and size of the Text member to determine the destination object bounds that vsnprintf may write into.\n\nUT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS (macro value): The static Buf array size and the wrap logic for TextIndex depend on this macro. Its value is needed to check that TextIndex indexing cannot access out-of-range elements of Buf and to understand buffer reuse behavior across calls.\n\nvsnprintf (declaration and semantic contract): Although declared in <stdio.h>, vsnprintf is the routine that performs the write. You need its prototype and guaranteed behavior (how the size parameter is interpreted, NUL-termination guarantees, and return-value semantics) for determining whether the call can write beyond the bounds given sizeof(Buf[...].Text).\n\nva_list / va_start / va_end (stdarg types/macros): These govern how the varargs are collected and forwarded to vsnprintf. While they do not directly change buffer bounds, their correct use and the type of arguments passed affect the produced output length; incorrect use could cause mismatched format/argument pairs and thus unexpected output sizes. Include the stdarg definitions to verify correct usage.\n\nuint32 (typedef): TextIndex is declared uint32; the width and signedness of this typedef determine wrap-around and comparison semantics (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS). You need the typedef to reason about potential overflow or incorrect indexing behavior."
