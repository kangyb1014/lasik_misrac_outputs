  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function and the related symbols for occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions (examples include: __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), anonymous structs/unions as a compiler extension, __int128, Microsoft __declspec, GCC __extension__ markers, nonstandard token pasting, or other vendor-specific keywords). None of the shown code uses any of those constructs. The code only uses standard C features: typedefs, pointer operations, integer arithmetic and bit-masking, structure member accesses, function calls, and standard comment syntax. The OS_DEBUG/OS_Unlock_Global/OS_Lock_Global identifiers may be macros or platform functions, but no macro syntax shown relies on compiler extensions (variadic macros would be a standard C99 feature if present). Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that appear to use language extensions that must be reported for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
