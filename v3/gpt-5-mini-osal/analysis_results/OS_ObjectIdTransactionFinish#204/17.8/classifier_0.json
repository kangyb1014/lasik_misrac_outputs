  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call OS_Lock_Global(token) passes the pointer but does not modify the parameter variable 'token' itself. Modifying the object pointed to by token (e.g. token->lock_mode) is permitted by the rule. This would only violate Rule 17.8 if OS_Lock_Global actually altered the pointer variable (for example via a macro that assigns to token or a function that takes &token and changes it), which is not indicated here."
