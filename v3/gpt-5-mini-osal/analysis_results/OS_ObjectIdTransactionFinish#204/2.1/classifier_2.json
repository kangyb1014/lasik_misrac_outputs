  "scenario": "No violation. The early return when token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE prevents execution only for that case; for all other modes (EXCLUSIVE, REFCOUNT, GLOBAL) the function continues and reaches token->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE. Therefore the assignment is reachable and does not constitute unreachable code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
