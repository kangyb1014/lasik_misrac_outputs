  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression depends on the runtime value token->lock_mode and is not a compile-time or functionally invariant constant. At function entry token->lock_mode can be NONE, GLOBAL, EXCLUSIVE, REFCOUNT, etc., so the condition may evaluate true or false depending on caller/state. (A violation would occur only if token->lock_mode were guaranteed constant at that point \u2014 e.g. if the caller always set token->lock_mode to OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE and it cannot change before this check \u2014 making the expression always true.)"
