  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No executed operations that could be removed without affecting program behaviour were identified in the provided code. Rationale by fragment: \n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: clock_gettime, increment of timeout.tv_sec, the call to pthread_mutex_timedlock and the distinct return paths are all active operations whose results (the timeout and mutex acquisition status) directly affect caller behaviour. Removing any of them would change timing or synchronization semantics.\n\n- OS_BinSemGive_Impl: acquiring the mutex, setting sem->current_value = 1, signalling the condition variable, and unlocking the mutex are all required to correctly wake and synchronize other threads. Each operation changes shared state or causes a thread wake-up; none are no-ops.\n\n- OS_BinSemFlush_Impl: acquiring the mutex, incrementing sem->flush_request, broadcasting the condition variable, and unlocking the mutex are necessary to notify and force pending takers to return. Each statement updates state or causes wake-ups and thus affects behaviour.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: acquiring the mutex, pushing the cleanup handler, taking a snapshot of flush_request, the while-loop condition and the calls to pthread_cond_wait/pthread_cond_timedwait, setting return_code on timeout, updating sem->current_value when appropriate, and popping/executing the cleanup handler are all control-flow or state-changing operations used later in the function or relied upon by other threads. Removing any of these would alter synchronization, error/timeout handling, or resource release (mutex unlocking).\n\nNo obvious dead code (executable code whose removal would not affect program behaviour) was found. There is also no unreachable code in the fragments shown. Therefore no code fragments are flagged for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
