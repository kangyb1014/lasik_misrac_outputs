  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule banning memcmp for null\u2011terminated strings:\n\n- clock_gettime: This function is called directly by the target. Inspect its implementation or wrapper to confirm it does not call memcmp (or inline helpers that use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings).\n\n- pthread_mutex_timedlock: This is the other direct callee. Its implementation (or any inline wrappers/macros in headers) must be checked to ensure it does not call memcmp for NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The rule targets this library function. The analyzer must search for uses of memcmp reachable from the target (directly or via called functions) to determine if the target function causes a prohibited memcmp-for-strings usage.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: The constant is used as an argument to clock_gettime; include it to locate the relevant header/implementation context in which any inline code might exist.\n\n- struct timespec: The target manipulates a timespec (timeout.tv_sec). The struct definition and any associated inline/utility functions/macros must be checked in case they contain string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: The mutex type may be an opaque/inline structure or typedef; its definition or associated inline helpers/macros should be inspected for any memcmp usage.\n\n- OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS: This macro/constant is used to modify timeout.tv_sec. Check its definition in the OSAL code to confirm it does not expand to any code that uses memcmp.\n\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE and OS_SUCCESS: These return-value macros/constants come from the OSAL headers. Their definitions should be inspected to ensure they are simple constants and not macros/functions that could invoke memcmp.\n\n- <time.h>, <pthread.h>, <string.h>: The relevant standard headers should be inspected because they can contain inline functions, macros, or platform-specific wrappers that might call memcmp. <string.h> in particular is where memcmp is declared; include it to locate potential inlines and to confirm whether memcmp is used in any header-provided inline implementations.\n\nIn short: to prove the target function does not violate the memcmp rule you must inspect all directly called functions (clock_gettime, pthread_mutex_timedlock), any types/macros it uses (timespec, pthread_mutex_t, constants and OS macros), and search for memcmp usages (and header-provided inlines) reachable from the target."
