  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex and the related macro definitions. There are no calls to memcmp and no other string-comparison operations (no use of strcmp, strncmp, or any memcmp-like comparisons of character buffers). The function only calls clock_gettime and pthread_mutex_timedlock and manipulates a timespec structure and integer macros. Therefore there are no code fragments that use the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and nothing that needs investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
