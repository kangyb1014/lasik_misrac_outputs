  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragments present are standard C constructs or POSIX API calls, not language extensions as described in compiler documentation: \n\n- The function signature and return type (int32 via typedef of int32_t) is plain C typedef usage, not a compiler extension. \n- struct timespec and CLOCK_REALTIME / clock_gettime are POSIX time API identifiers (library calls/types), not compiler language extensions. \n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_mutex_timedlock are POSIX threads API items, not compiler language extensions. \n- The macros (OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS, OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS) are ordinary preprocessor macros, not language extensions. \n- No use of compiler-specific tokens or features (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({: ... :}), builtins like __builtin_*, or other documented compiler extensions) is present.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) in this snippet."
