  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex participates in direct or indirect recursion we must examine functions that call it and the functions those callers call / are called by: \n- OS_BinSemGive_Impl: Direct caller of the target. Its body must be inspected to see if it (or functions it calls) can lead back to OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex, forming an indirect cycle.\n- OS_BinSemFlush_Impl: Direct caller of the target. Same rationale as above.\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: Direct caller of the target. Must be checked for any call paths back to the target.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: A callee used by the three callers above; it (or its callees) could call back into the target and create an indirect recursion, so it must be checked.\n- OS_BinSemGive, OS_BinSemFlush, OS_BinSemTake_Impl, OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl: These are callers of the three direct callers (per the static graph). They are included so the analysis can follow longer call chains upward/downward to detect any multi-step indirect path that returns to OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex.\n\nCollectively these symbols provide the relevant neighboring call-graph context (callers, callers' callers, and immediate callees) needed to prove whether any call path exists that would cause OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex to call itself directly or indirectly."
