  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA C 'for loop shall be well-formed' with respect to OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex:\n\n- OS_BinSemGive_Impl, OS_BinSemFlush_Impl, OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl:\n  These are the immediate callers of OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex (per the static call graph). A for-loop in any of these functions that calls OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex would include the callee's behaviour as part of the loop body. To determine whether those loops comply with the MISRA clauses (e.g., whether the loop counter or objects used in the loop clauses are modified by the callee), you must inspect these caller functions.\n\n- OS_BinSemGive, OS_BinSemFlush, OS_BinSemTake_Impl, OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl:\n  These are higher-level callers in the call chain (callers of the immediate callers). A for-loop might appear at any level above OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex and still include the callee in its body. Include these to locate and analyze any for-loops that transitively call the target function.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken:\n  This function is called by the immediate caller functions. If a for-loop in a caller uses objects that OS_ObjectIndexFromToken reads or writes (or if that function has side effects on objects used in loop clauses), those side effects must be known because the MISRA rule forbids loop-clause use of objects modified in the loop body.\n\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS:\n  The target returns these constants. Callers may use the return value in loop conditions or to modify loop counters/flags. To determine if a for-loop's second/third clause uses objects changed by the loop body, you must know how callers use the return values.\n\n- OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS:\n  This constant is used to modify timeout inside the function. While timeout is local, the constant affects timing behavior (blocking) and may affect whether callers rely on side effects or timing-sensitive loop logic; include it for completeness when reasoning about semantics that could influence loop control.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t, pthread_mutex_timedlock:\n  The function locks the mutex pointed to by 'mut' via pthread_mutex_timedlock. Locking modifies the mutex object (and possibly other synchronization-visible state). If a for-loop's second or third clause (or a loop control flag) uses the same mutex object or any object whose state is changed by locking, that would violate the MISRA requirement that the loop-clause not use objects modified by the loop body. Therefore the mutex type and the locking function semantics are essential.\n\n- clock_gettime, struct timespec, CLOCK_REALTIME:\n  These are used to compute the absolute timeout. While 'timeout' is a local object (so unlikely to violate loop-clause rules directly), clock_gettime is a function called inside the target and may have side effects (or fail). The MISRA rule counts the behavior of called functions as part of the loop body; include these symbols to be able to reason about any side effects and their potential interactions with loop control expressions.\n\nOverall rationale: The MISRA rule focuses on whether objects used in for-loop clauses are modified by the loop body (including behaviour of called functions). To check compliance for any for-loop that calls OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex (directly or transitively), you must inspect the caller(s) for loops and know all symbols and functions the callee touches or returns that could be used by loop clauses. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to trace such interactions (call sites, return values, global/constants, and the external functions/types that the target calls and that can produce side-effects visible to loop clauses)."
