  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no uses of memcmp (or other C standard library string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp), and it does not perform any comparisons of char* or string data. All comparisons are integer/bitmask checks (e.g. token->obj_type, token->lock_mode, objtype->owner_key.key_value & 0xFF000000, equality of integer key_value fields). There are no calls to memcmp, no pointer-to-char string handling, and no null-terminated string comparisons to inspect, so no code fragments in this function are relevant to Rule 21.14."
