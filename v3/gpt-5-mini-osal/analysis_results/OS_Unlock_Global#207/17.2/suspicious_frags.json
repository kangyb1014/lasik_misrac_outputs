  "explanation": "Only function calls (and any expressions that may invoke functions) can produce direct or indirect recursion. The fragments reported above cover every call site present in the provided code: all OS_DEBUG calls, the call to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl, the pthread calls, and strerror, any of which could (directly or indirectly) call back into OS_Unlock_Global and therefore must be investigated. Other code in the function consists of simple expressions, bitwise operations, comparisons, and structure/assignment operations (e.g. token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, token->lock_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID, objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type], owner_key comparisons, etc.). Those do not perform function calls and thus cannot by themselves create recursion, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
