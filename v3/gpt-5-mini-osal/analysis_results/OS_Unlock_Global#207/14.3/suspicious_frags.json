  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (if/while/for/do-while). The only controlling expressions in this function are the two if-statements listed above; there are no loops or other conditional operators in the function. Other lines are assignments, function calls, or debug prints (e.g. objtype->owner_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID; token->lock_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID; OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(...); OS_DEBUG(...);), which are not subject to Rule 14.3. Therefore no additional fragments need investigation."
