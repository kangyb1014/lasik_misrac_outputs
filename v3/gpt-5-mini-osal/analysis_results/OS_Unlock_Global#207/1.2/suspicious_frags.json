  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Items that might look unusual but are standard C features and therefore not compiler extensions include:\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID defined as ((osal_key_t){0}) \u2014 this is a C99/C11 compound literal, not a compiler extension.\n- The cast expressions (unsigned int) and (unsigned long) used in OS_DEBUG \u2014 simple standard casts.\n- The format specifier %lx and corresponding cast to unsigned long \u2014 standard C usage (although callers should ensure the underlying type width matches, this is not a language extension).\n- The bitmask and hex constants (e.g. 0xFF000000, 0x4D000000) \u2014 standard integer literals.\n- Use of macros and struct typedefs \u2014 standard preprocessor and type-usage.\n\nThere are also no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension constructs such as __attribute__ or __declspec annotations, typeof, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), nested functions, inline assembly, pragma directives for specific compilers, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore no code fragments need to be escalated for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
