  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: the pointer 'task' is later used to modify task->priority (task->priority = new_priority), so it must be a pointer to a modifiable (non-const) type. A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for read-only access (for example, only reading fields like task->state) \u2014 in that case it should be declared as 'const OS_task_internal_record_t *' and leaving it as a non-const pointer would violate Rule 8.13."
