  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible):\n- The function signature and the scalar local (int32 return_code) do not declare pointer types, so the rule does not apply.\n- The local variable 'token' (OS_object_token_t token) is an object (not a pointer) \u2014 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and pointer targets, so the declaration itself is not a candidate.\n- The control-flow constructs (if/return) and the comments contain no pointer declarations or pointer targets and therefore are not relevant for this rule.\nThe listed fragments include all occurrences in this function where pointers (or addresses of objects) are obtained/used or where a non-const pointer target might be expected; these should be investigated to determine whether the pointers could/should be to const-qualified types. No other code in the function needs investigation under Rule 8.13."
