  "explanation": "I inspected the function for any direct modifications to the formal parameters (assignments to filename or SizeLimit). There are no direct assignments or pointer reassignments (e.g., no statements like filename = ... or SizeLimit = ...). Calls that pass parameters (OS_TranslatePath and OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl) pass them by value; such calls cannot change the caller's parameter variable (they may modify the pointed-to object, which is allowed by the rule). The only macro invocation that could plausibly modify the parameter identifier within this function is OS_CHECK_POINTER(filename), so it is flagged for investigation. All other lines operate on local variables or pass parameters by value and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
