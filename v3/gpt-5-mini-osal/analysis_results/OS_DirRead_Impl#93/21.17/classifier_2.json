  "scenario": "The assignment itself is in-bounds when dirent->FileName is an actual array of char (e.g. char FileName[N]) and N >= 1: strncpy uses sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1 so at most N-1 bytes are written and the explicit dirent->FileName[N-1] = 0 writes the last element \u2014 compliant with Rule 21.17. A violation can occur if FileName is not an array but a pointer (e.g. char *FileName) or a flexible/unknown-length object: sizeof(dirent->FileName) would yield the size of the pointer, causing the strncpy length to be incorrect and potentially causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes (and the explicit write to sizeof(dirent->FileName)-1 would then not necessarily target the real buffer\u2019s last byte)."
