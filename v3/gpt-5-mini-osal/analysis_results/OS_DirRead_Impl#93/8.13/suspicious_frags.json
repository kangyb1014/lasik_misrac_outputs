  "explanation": "The function parameter token is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token) and therefore complies with Rule 8.13. The parameter dirent is an output buffer that is written to within this function, so it must remain a non-const pointer and does not need investigation for this rule. The remaining statements (NULL check of de, explicit zero-termination of FileName, and the return statements) are related to control flow and buffer safety rather than pointer const-qualification and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 8.13. The listed fragments are the locations where pointers to non-const types are declared or used read-only and thus should be reviewed to determine whether they could instead point to const-qualified types."
