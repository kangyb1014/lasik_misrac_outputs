  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided code. The only conditional is\n- if (status != 0)\nand 'status' is assigned from pthread_mutex_lock(...) at runtime, so the controlling expression is not invariant. There are no loops (while, for, do-while) or switch statements with constant/compile-time invariant controlling expressions. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an array index using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)), and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken reads token->obj_idx at runtime, so that is not an invariant controlling expression either. The return statements use constant values but are not control expressions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
