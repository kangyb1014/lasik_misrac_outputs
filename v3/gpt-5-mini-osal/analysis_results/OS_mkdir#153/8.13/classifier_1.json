  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment declares a mutable array (char local_path[...]) rather than a pointer; Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and recommending const-qualified pointee types when possible. Here the buffer is intended to be written to (OS_TranslatePath(local_path,...)), so it must be non-const. (If a pointer parameter were used and the function did not modify the pointee, that parameter should be const-qualified.)"
