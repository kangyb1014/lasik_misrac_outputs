Fix: change OS_TranslatePath to take a const char * for the input path (or make an explicit non-const copy before calling). (If OS_TranslatePath already declares its first parameter as const char *, then there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's assessment is correct but conditional. The OS_mkdir code as shown does not itself violate Rule 8.13. However, if OS_TranslatePath is prototyped as int32 OS_TranslatePath(char *path, char *local_path); then calling it with OS_mkdir's const char *path would effectively discard the const qualifier (passing a const-qualified pointer to a non-const parameter). That situation contravenes the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible).\n\nRemedy: change the OS_TranslatePath prototype to take a const char * for the input path (int32 OS_TranslatePath(const char *path, char *local_path);), or make an explicit non-const copy of path before calling OS_TranslatePath. If OS_TranslatePath already has a const first parameter, there is no violation.\n"
