  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 applies only to the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The shown function contains a single use of a <string.h> function: the memset(&ts, 0, sizeof(ts)) call, so this is the only fragment that needs investigation for potential out-of-bounds access. Other code lines (mq_timedsend invocation, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro use, token handling, and return-code logic) do not call any of the listed <string.h> functions and therefore are out of scope for Rule 21.17. Any potential issues with mq_timedsend's data/size arguments or macro semantics are outside the scope of MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 and so are not reported here."
