  "explanation": "Other pointer-related code in this function does not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameters 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and 'const void *data' are already const-qualified; the address-of 'ts' is passed to mq_timedsend which takes a const struct timespec * (so no additional const-qualification of a local pointer is applicable); there are no other pointer variables declared. Therefore only the usages involving the impl pointer are potentially relevant to whether the pointer could/should point to a const-qualified type."
