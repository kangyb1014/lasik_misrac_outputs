  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the single call alone. The call return_code = OS_FileRemove_Impl(local_path); does not by itself show any use of <string.h> functions or out-of-bounds access. It is safe provided OS_TranslatePath wrote a properly NUL-terminated string that fits within local_path (size OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN). A concrete violation scenario would be: OS_TranslatePath returns OS_SUCCESS but wrote exactly OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes without a terminating '\\0' (or otherwise did not NUL-terminate), and OS_FileRemove_Impl uses a string.h function such as strlen/strcpy on local_path \u2014 that would cause an access beyond the buffer bounds and violate Rule 21.17."
