  "scenario": "The declaration alone does not invoke any <string.h> functions, so the fragment itself does not violate Rule 21.17. A violation could occur if OS_TranslatePath (or any function called with local_path) copies or writes more than OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes into local_path using functions such as strcpy/memcpy/strcat without bounds checking. For example, if OS_TranslatePath uses strcpy(local_path, path) and strlen(path) >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, this would result in an out-of-bounds access and violate Rule 21.17. Ensure that routines writing into local_path enforce the buffer size (e.g. by checking lengths or using bounded copy idioms) to avoid a violation."
