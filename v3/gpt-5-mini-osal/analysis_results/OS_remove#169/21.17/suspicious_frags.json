  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);",

  ],
  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains only basic declarations, control flow (the if-check), assignment of the return value and the final return; none of those lines directly perform string handling or call standard <string.h> functions. The only fragments that can lead to out-of-bounds accesses via string.h routines are: the local buffer declaration (its size must be adequate) and the calls that pass pointers to functions which may use string functions internally (OS_TranslatePath can write into local_path and must not overflow it; OS_FileRemove_Impl may read local_path and relies on correct termination/size). Therefore only the listed fragments need investigation for compliance with MISRA C Rule 21.17."
