  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function definition, local array declaration, typedef alias (int32 -> int32_t), macro-based array size, macro constant OS_SUCCESS, and ordinary function calls (OS_TranslatePath, OS_FileRemove_Impl) are all standard C constructs. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, platform-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific tokens. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
