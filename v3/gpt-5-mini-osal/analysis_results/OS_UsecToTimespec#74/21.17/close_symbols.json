This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required to determine compliance with the quoted MISRA C rule. The rule applies only to the use of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, etc.).\n\nReasons:\n- The target function contains no calls to any string-handling functions and has no callees (callees list is empty). Therefore there is no direct or indirect use of the <string.h> functions to inspect inside this function.\n- The static call graph shows the only callers/callees related to this function are OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl (caller) and no callees; there are no string-handing functions reachable from this function that would need analysis.\n\nNotes (not required for the MISRA <string.h> rule):\n- If you want to analyze other safety properties (e.g., integer overflow or correct ranges for timespec fields), you may want the definitions of uint32 and struct timespec (and the types of tv_sec/tv_nsec). Those symbols are not needed to assess the quoted string-handling rule, so they are omitted from the required list."
