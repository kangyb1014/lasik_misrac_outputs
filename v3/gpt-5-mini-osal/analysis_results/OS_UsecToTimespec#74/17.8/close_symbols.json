  "explanation": "- typedef/definition of uint32: To confirm the exact underlying type and qualifiers (e.g. whether it is a plain integer type, a macro, or an alias with qualifiers) so we can determine whether usecs is a modifiable value parameter. The MISRA rule distinguishes modifying parameters themselves vs objects pointed to; knowing uint32 ensures usecs is indeed a value parameter and is not aliased or unusual.\n- definition of struct timespec (full member declarations): To verify the actual members tv_sec and tv_nsec exist and to see their types and any const/volatile qualifiers. If the members themselves were declared const, writes to them would be a violation. We must inspect the concrete member declarations to decide whether time_spec->tv_nsec and time_spec->tv_sec are legal modifications of the pointed-to object.\n- any macro definitions for tv_sec and tv_nsec (if present): If tv_sec or tv_nsec are implemented as macros (or mapped to accessor functions), the apparent assignments might expand to something that modifies the pointer itself or performs other operations; we must rule out such expansions.\n- declaration/prototype of OS_UsecToTimespec as seen by the compiler (to confirm any const/qualifier on the parameter): Although the source shows the signature, the effective declaration (from headers or earlier in the translation unit) might include qualifiers such as struct timespec * const or const struct timespec * which change whether the pointer or the pointee can be modified. MISRA's prohibition concerns modifying the parameter (the pointer variable) itself; we must confirm no qualifier or differing prototype would make the code non-conforming.\n- headers that introduce the above symbols (e.g. the header that defines uint32 and the header that defines struct timespec): To find the actual definitions and any indirect macros/attributes, we need the header/file locations where those types and macros are defined so the analyzer can examine them."
