  "explanation": "OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl \u2014 this is the direct caller of OS_UsecToTimespec (per the call graph). You must inspect its implementation to see whether it (or anything it calls) can call back to OS_UsecToTimespec or otherwise form a cycle. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken \u2014 called by OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl; it (or any functions it calls) could provide an indirect path back to OS_UsecToTimespec or to OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl, creating indirect recursion. OS_TimeBaseSet \u2014 the caller of OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl; the full caller chain must be examined to detect any higher-level path that eventually leads back to OS_UsecToTimespec. Note: after obtaining these, also examine any functions they call (their transitive callees) to determine whether any call chain returns to OS_UsecToTimespec (i.e., perform a transitive/call-graph closure check)."
