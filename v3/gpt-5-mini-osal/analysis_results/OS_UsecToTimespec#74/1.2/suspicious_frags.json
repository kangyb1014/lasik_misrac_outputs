  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C constructs: a file\u2011scope static function, a normal function prototype, pointer access (->), integer arithmetic and integer literals, and a reference to struct timespec (a POSIX type, not a compiler language extension). The identifier uint32 appears to be a typedef/name rather than a compiler language extension; its definition should be checked separately but by itself is not an explicit language extension. No compiler-specific keywords or constructs (for example __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, inline assembly, builtin functions, or other vendor-specific extensions) appear in the snippet, so there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
