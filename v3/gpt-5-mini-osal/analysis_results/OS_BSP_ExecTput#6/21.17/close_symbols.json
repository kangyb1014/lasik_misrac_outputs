This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl \u2014 immediate caller: needed to inspect how the cap and param arguments are created/passed (are they derived from buffers, truncated/copy operations, or produced by string.h functions like strcpy/strncpy/strcat). If those callers use string.h functions incorrectly, the problem originates there even though OS_BSP_ExecTput does not call string.h itself.\n\nUT_BSP_DoText \u2014 transitive caller shown in the call graph: include to trace back farther to the origin of cap/param; ensure no intermediate caller performs unsafe string operations or passes non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated/overflowed pointers into OS_BSP_ExecTput.\n\nexeclp \u2014 semantic requirement: execlp expects NUL\u2011terminated C strings for its argv list and will read them in the child process. To determine if OS_BSP_ExecTput can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses (by some function reading those strings), you must know execlp's argument contract and ensure cap/param are valid NUL\u2011terminated buffers as produced by callers.\n\nfork, waitpid, exit, EXIT_FAILURE \u2014 control\u2011flow/behavior symbols: included so the analyzer understands the fork/exec/exit pattern used here (child does execlp then exit on failure; parent waits). While these are not string.h functions, their presence affects whether any string handling occurs in this function (none does) and whether potential string accesses could happen in the child (via execlp). In short, these symbols are needed to reason about where string accesses would actually occur and therefore whether this function itself violates the MISRA string.h bounds rule."
