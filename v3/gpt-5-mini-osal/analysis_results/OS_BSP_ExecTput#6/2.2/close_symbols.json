  "explanation": "Explaination of why each symbol is required for a dead-code (MISRA) analysis of OS_BSP_ExecTput:\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl\n  - This is the direct caller shown in the static call graph. You must inspect its implementation to determine the conditions under which it calls OS_BSP_ExecTput, whether that call is reachable in normal builds, and whether removing OS_BSP_ExecTput would change observable behaviour (side-effects, return values, timing) of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - It is the caller of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl in the call chain. Knowing whether the call chain is only exercised by unit-test scaffolding (or similarly optional code) versus production code affects whether OS_BSP_ExecTput is actually used in deployed behaviour (dead vs. used code).\n\n- (call-site) cap/param construction in OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl\n  - You need the exact code that builds the cap and param argument values at the call site to see if the call has runtime effect (e.g., different parameters change terminal state), whether the arguments are constant/unused, or if the call is effectively a no-op in practice. This helps determine whether removal would change behaviour.\n\n- fork\n  - The fork system call creates a child process and has clear runtime side-effects (process creation, scheduling, resource use). Understanding fork semantics is necessary to reason about observable behaviour (timing, resource usage). If removing OS_BSP_ExecTput eliminates fork() calls, that may affect system behaviour and thus would not be dead code.\n\n- execlp\n  - execlp replaces the child process image with the external \"tput\" program. The external program produces side-effects (terminal control sequences). You must consider execlp semantics and its effect on external state to decide whether the call is necessary for program behaviour.\n\n- exit\n  - The child calls exit(EXIT_FAILURE) on execlp failure. The use of exit in the child affects child termination semantics and possibly parent waitpid results; analyze whether these effects are meaningful for program behaviour.\n\n- waitpid\n  - The parent waits for the child; this affects program timing and synchronization. Removing OS_BSP_ExecTput would remove a wait, which can change timing/ordering\u2014important for MISRA dead-code analysis because timing is part of observable behaviour for embedded systems.\n\n- pid_t\n  - The type of cpid and semantics around process identifiers are relevant to understanding return values from fork()/waitpid() and whether any return values are used elsewhere (affecting behaviour).\n\n- EXIT_FAILURE\n  - The specific exit code used by the child on execlp failure may be observed by parent or system monitoring; include this macro to reason about observable termination behaviour.\n\n- build/configuration macros that affect inclusion of these functions (e.g. BSP_CONSOLE_SUPPORT, UNIT_TEST, conditional #ifdefs)\n  - Whether the function (or its callers) is compiled into production images can determine if it is dead. Conditional compilation can make code appear in static analysis but be absent in a given build configuration. You must check relevant compile-time macros to determine real-world reachability and effect.\n\n- external effect of the tput command (runtime/OS environment)\n  - tput is an external program invoked via execlp; its side-effects (changing terminal modes, emitting control sequences) are not visible in the C code but are part of program behaviour. To decide if OS_BSP_ExecTput is dead, you must consider whether those external side-effects are relied upon elsewhere (e.g., subsequent I/O, user-visible state). If they are relied on, removal would change behaviour and the code is not dead.\n\nSummary: to determine if OS_BSP_ExecTput is dead code you must examine its callers (OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl and upstream UT_BSP_DoText and the exact call-site arguments), any conditional compilation that governs inclusion, the semantics and side-effects of the POSIX calls used (fork/execlp/exit/waitpid and related types/macros), and the external behaviour of the invoked tput command \u2014 all of which influence observable behaviour (including timing) and therefore whether removal would alter the program."
