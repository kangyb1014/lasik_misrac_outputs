  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only controlling expressions are the two if statements: \"if (cpid < 0)\" and \"if (cpid == 0)\"; both depend on the runtime result of fork() stored in cpid (which can be <0, 0, or >0) and therefore are not constant/invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. Calls such as execlp, exit and waitpid are not controlling expressions. The two permitted exceptions (infinite loops implemented via invariant expressions, and the specific do-while integer constant exception) do not apply here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
