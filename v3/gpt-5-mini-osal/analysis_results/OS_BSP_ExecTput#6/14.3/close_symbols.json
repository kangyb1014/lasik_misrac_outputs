  "explanation": "- fork: Core to determining whether the controlling expressions are invariant. fork() returns different values in parent (positive child's PID), child (0), or error (-1). Knowing these return semantics is required to show that the expressions (cpid < 0) and (cpid == 0) are not compile-time/constant invariants.\n- pid_t: Type of cpid. Its signedness and range affect the validity of comparisons against 0 and -1; the analysis must know pid_t semantics to determine if comparisons can meaningfully change.\n- execlp: Called in the child branch. Its semantics (attempt to replace the process image) and its presence show that the child executes a different path; this helps establish that the child\u2019s cpid value (0) leads to a different control flow than the parent, so the condition is not invariant across processes.\n- exit: Used after execlp failure in the child. Knowing exit semantics confirms the child does not proceed to parent-only code, reinforcing that control flow differs between child and parent.\n- waitpid: Called in the parent. Its presence demonstrates the parent\u2019s separate execution path (uses the positive pid returned by fork), supporting the conclusion that the controlling expressions depend on fork()\u2019s nondeterministic return.\n- EXIT_FAILURE: The constant passed to exit on exec failure; included to fully understand the child\u2019s behavior on exec failure (not strictly required to show non-invariance of the conditions, but necessary to reason about child termination semantics).\n- NULL: Used in the execlp argument list; included to fully characterize the execlp call and the child\u2019s control flow.  \n\nIn short, fork and pid_t are essential to decide whether the controlling expressions are invariant; the exec/exit/waitpid symbols (and the constants NULL/EXIT_FAILURE) are required to reason about the distinct child vs parent control flows that demonstrate the expressions are not invariant."
