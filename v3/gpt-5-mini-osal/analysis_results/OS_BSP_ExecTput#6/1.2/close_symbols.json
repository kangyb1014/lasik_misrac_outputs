  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions of every external symbol and relevant macros used by the function, because language extensions (e.g. compiler built-ins, non\u2011standard attributes, special calling conventions, or extension keywords) typically appear in those declarations. Reason for each symbol: \n\n- pid_t (typedef/type): The concrete typedef/definition may be compiler or platform supplied; inspect its definition to see if it uses non\u2011standard extension constructs (compiler attributes, special integer kinds, or other implementation\u2011specific keywords).\n- fork (function): Its prototype or implementation may be provided as a compiler builtin or via macros/attributes (e.g. special calling convention or __attribute__ annotations). You need the declaration to check for such extensions.\n- execlp (function): As a POSIX variadic function, its declaration could include compiler\u2011specific attributes or be mapped to a builtin; inspect the prototype for any extension markers.\n- waitpid (function): Same as fork/execlp \u2014 check its declaration for attributes or compiler\u2011specific constructs.\n- exit (function): Declaration may carry attributes (noreturn) or be a builtin; check to ensure any such annotations are standard and not compiler\u2011specific extensions.\n- EXIT_FAILURE (macro): Macro definition must be inspected to ensure it is a simple integral constant and does not rely on extension syntax or compiler\u2011specific macros.\n- NULL (macro): Inspect its definition to ensure it uses a standard representation (e.g. ((void*)0) or 0) and not a compiler extension.\n- <sys/types.h>, <unistd.h>, <sys/wait.h>, <stdlib.h>, <stddef.h>/<stdio.h> (headers): You need the actual header declarations/definitions where the above symbols/macros are defined to detect any uses of compiler extensions (attributes, builtin mappings, non\u2011standard keywords, inline assembly, or macros documented as compiler extensions).\n\nCollecting and examining these symbol declarations/headers lets the next analyzer determine whether any of the used symbols introduce language/compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
