  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only pointer occurrences are the function parameters 'const char *cap' and 'const char *param', which are already const-qualified. There are no pointer variable declarations in the function body. The execlp call expects const char * arguments and the passed string literals and the const-qualified parameters match that expectation (NULL is used as the terminating pointer). fork(), waitpid() and exit() do not involve pointer targets that would require const qualification. Therefore there are no places in this function where a pointer should be changed to point to a const-qualified type."
