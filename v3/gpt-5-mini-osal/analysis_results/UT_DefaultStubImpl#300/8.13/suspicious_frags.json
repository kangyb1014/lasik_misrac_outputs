  ],
  "explanation": "The only pointer-like entities in this function are covered above. const char *FunctionName is already const-qualified and therefore conforms to Rule 8.13, so it is not reported. int32 Retcode and the parameter DefaultRc are non-pointer scalar types. va_list is implementation-defined (it may be an array or a pointer type on some platforms); because its underlying representation is not visible here, its declaration and uses are included for investigation. UT_EntryKey_t is a typedef whose underlying type is not shown in this fragment; if it resolves to a pointer type it would need const-qualification, so the parameter declaration is included. Other lines (va_end, return, the function signature keywords) do not introduce pointer types and hence are not suspicious for Rule 8.13."
