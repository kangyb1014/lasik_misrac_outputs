  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The variadic function syntax, va_list, va_start and va_end are part of standard ISO C and are not extensions. Passing a va_list to another function by value is standard behavior. The identifiers int32 and UT_EntryKey_t appear to be project typedefs (not compiler-specific keywords or extensions) and their presence does not in itself indicate use of a language extension. There are no compiler-specific constructs present (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions, or other vendor-specific keywords or builtins) that would need to be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
