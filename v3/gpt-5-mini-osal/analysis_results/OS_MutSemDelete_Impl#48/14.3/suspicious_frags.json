  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function and related symbols. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in loop constructs (for, while, do-while). The target function OS_MutSemDelete_Impl contains no loop constructs \u2014 only an assignment from pthread_mutex_destroy and an if statement: if (status != 0). That controlling expression is not invariant because status is set at runtime by pthread_mutex_destroy. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an array indexing expression and is not a loop control expression. No do-while with an essentially-Boolean constant, no for(;;) or while(1) infinite-loop constructs are present. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
