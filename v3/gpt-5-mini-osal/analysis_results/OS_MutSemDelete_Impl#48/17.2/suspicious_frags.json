  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that suggest direct or indirect recursive calls to OS_MutSemDelete_Impl and therefore nothing that needs investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Rationale:\n\n- The body of OS_MutSemDelete_Impl contains only two operations that could be function-like: the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and a call to pthread_mutex_destroy. There is no explicit call to OS_MutSemDelete_Impl anywhere in the function.\n\n- pthread_mutex_destroy is a POSIX API function (external library); it does not call back into the application\u2019s OS_MutSemDelete_Impl and is not a candidate for indirect recursion originating from this code.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET appears to be a table/macros access to retrieve impl from OS_impl_mutex_table. The provided related code shows a static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token) that simply returns token->obj_idx (an access of a field) \u2014 this inline function does not call OS_MutSemDelete_Impl or any other function that could lead back to it.\n\n- OS_impl_mutex_table is a global array of OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t and OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t is a plain struct containing a pthread_mutex_t; there are no function pointers or callbacks in those types that could cause an indirect call back into OS_MutSemDelete_Impl.\n\n- No other functions are invoked from OS_MutSemDelete_Impl that could be investigated for indirect recursion.\n\nIf the exact expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET were provided and it contained a function call, that expansion should be reviewed; based on the supplied definitions and typical usage (array indexing via token index), there is no recursion to investigate."
