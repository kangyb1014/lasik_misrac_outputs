True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes the address of a local token object to OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl(&token). If the implementation of OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl takes a parameter of type OS_object_token_t * (non-const) but does not modify the token, then the pointer parameter should be const-qualified (e.g. const OS_object_token_t *). In that case Rule 8.13 is violated. If, however, OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl legitimately modifies the token, then no violation occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not determinable from the call site alone. MISRA C 2023 R8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer parameter should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. The code shown merely passes &token; that by itself does not violate R8.13. The report would be correct only if OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl is declared/defined as taking OS_object_token_t * and in fact does not modify the token \u2014 in that case the function parameter should be changed to const OS_object_token_t * and R8.13 would be violated as reported. If OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl legitimately modifies the token, then no violation occurs. So the agent's scenario is a valid possibility, but the supplied code alone does not prove a violation. Inspect the prototype/definition of OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl to decide: if it does not modify the token, change its parameter to const; otherwise no change is needed."
