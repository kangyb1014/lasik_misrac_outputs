  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA C dead-code analysis:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The function takes a pointer to this type; its definition (layout) is required to determine whether the code inside the function can actually access and modify the intended bytes. If the type makes the conversion/cast invalid or the field never exists, the assignments could be dead or undefined.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and uses its members. The accessor definition (fields and their types) is necessary to determine which assignments are effectful (e.g., whether writing sin_port actually changes meaningful state) and whether any members are unused elsewhere (which affects whether the assignments are dead).\n\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t) / its size and type: The function casts &Addr->AddrData to an accessor pointer. The size/type/alignment of AddrData determines whether this cast is well-formed and whether the code actually updates reachable memory. If AddrData is too small or differently aligned, the code could be ineffective/undefined and therefore potentially dead.\n\n- Accessor->sa (type of this member, typically struct sockaddr) and its sa_family member: The switch uses sa_family to select behavior. You must know the possible values sa_family can hold (and how/where it is set) to decide if any switch cases are ever taken at runtime (i.e., whether a case is dead because sa_family can never have that value).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (sa_in) and member sin_port: The AF_INET case assigns to sin_port. To judge whether that assignment is meaningful and non-dead you need the definition of sockaddr_in and sin_port (type, size, side-effects if any), and to know whether other code reads this field.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sa_in6) and member sin6_port: Same reason as sockaddr_in: the AF_INET6 case writes sin6_port. Its definition and usage determine whether that assignment is effectful or dead.\n\n- AF_INET: The constant used in the switch. You must know its value and semantics to determine whether the AF_INET branch can be selected in practice.\n\n- AF_INET6: Same as AF_INET \u2014 needed to determine reachability of the IPv6 case.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (compile-time macro): The AF_INET6 case is inside #ifdef. Whether this macro is defined controls whether the code is present at all. For dead-code analysis you must know if that branch is compiled in (present) or compiled out (not present). (Note: compile-time-eliminated code is not present to be considered dead at runtime.)\n\n- htons (function or macro): The function performs sa_port = htons(PortNum) and stores that value. While htons is usually side-effect-free, you must confirm its definition (macro vs function) to ensure it has no side-effects that would make its execution relevant even if the assignment were otherwise unnecessary.\n\n- in_port_t typedef: The type of sa_port and the port fields matters to determine whether assignments are well-typed and whether any implicit conversions/side-effects occur.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS: The default case returns this value. To decide if the default branch or its removal would affect program behavior you need the meaning/usage of this return value (and whether callers rely on it).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The normal return value when a port is set. Understanding its semantics helps decide whether removing parts of the function (e.g., the default branch) would change observable behavior.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrSetPort (caller) and its call-sites / references: Dead code requires considering whether the routine is ever called. The immediate caller(s) and their call-sites determine reachability of OS_SocketAddrSetPort_Impl. If the caller(s) are themselves never referenced, the whole chain could be dead. To conclude the function is dead you must inspect callers and their usage across the project.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyst determine: (1) whether the code in each switch case can ever execute (based on sa_family values and compile-time macros), (2) whether the writes performed are observable by other code (field definitions and usage), (3) whether the function itself is reachable from the rest of the system (callers), and (4) whether any seemingly redundant operations have side-effects (htons) that would prevent them from being dead."
