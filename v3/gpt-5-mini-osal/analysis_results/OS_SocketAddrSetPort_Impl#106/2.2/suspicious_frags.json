  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are not suspicious for dead code because they perform required control flow or data operations that affect program behaviour: the switch dispatch on sa_family is necessary to select which sockaddr field to update; the breaks and final return are required to control function flow; the cast to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t and the use of Addr->AddrData access the underlying address storage and are not redundant; the assignment to the sockaddr fields (Accessor->sa_in.sin_port / sa_in6.sin6_port) are the observable effects of the function. Note also that conditional compilation (#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6) may remove the IPv6 case entirely at build time (not dead code in the compiled artifact), and unreachable code (per MISRA note 2) is distinct from dead code. Initialization vs assignment distinction (MISRA note 3) has been considered: the declarations themselves are not mere initializations and their subsequent uses are shown. Therefore only the listed fragments warrant further inspection for potential dead-code concerns."
