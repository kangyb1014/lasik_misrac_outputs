  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are compile-time or otherwise invariant. The only controlling statement is switch(Accessor->sa.sa_family), which depends on the runtime value stored in Addr->AddrData and therefore is not invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) whose controlling expressions could be constant; the #ifdef only affects which case labels are compiled in and does not make the switch expression invariant. The switch also includes a default branch to handle unexpected values. Therefore there are no code fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
