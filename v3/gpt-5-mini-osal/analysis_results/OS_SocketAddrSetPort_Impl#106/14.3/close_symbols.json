  "explanation": "- OS_SockAddr_t: The switch expression is computed from a field that is reached via Addr->AddrData. The exact layout and type of AddrData determine whether the sa_family value can vary at runtime or is effectively a compile-time/constant value. The definition is required to determine mutability and aliasing concerns.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The code casts &Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and reads Accessor->sa.sa_family. The accessor's definition (including any const/volatile qualifiers) is needed to know whether sa_family is an invariant (e.g., declared const) or can change at runtime.\n\n- struct sockaddr and the type of sa_family (sa_family_t): sa_family's declared type and qualifiers (and whether it is an enum, macro, or integer type) affect whether the controlling expression can be considered invariant. If sa_family is an enum constant or a macro, or has const qualifier, the switch controlling expression might be invariant \u2014 this must be checked from the type definition.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6: While these do not directly affect the controlling expression, their definitions confirm the union/overlay layout used by OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t and show whether reading/writing to sin_port/sin6_port could imply the family is fixed. Also their member qualifiers (if any) may affect mutability analysis.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: The switch compares sa_family to these constants. Their values and definitions are needed to determine whether the comparisons are meaningful and whether one or more case labels are actually different from each other or equal to the controlling expression's constant.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: This build-time macro controls whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled. If AF_INET6 case is omitted, the switch may have fewer reachable branches; knowing the build configuration is necessary to determine whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant in the compiled variant.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst decide if Accessor->sa.sa_family can vary at runtime (perceived as non-invariant) or if, due to types, qualifiers, or build configuration, the controlling expression is effectively invariant (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
