  "explanation": "The AF_INET6 case is wrapped in a preprocessor conditional. Depending on build configuration this entire branch may be compiled out (making related code unreachable in some builds) or compiled in (but still possibly never reached at runtime); it therefore should be investigated for unreachable-code issues across configurations. The default: return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS; branch should be inspected because if, by design or construction of Addr data, sa_family can only ever be AF_INET (and AF_INET6 when enabled), the default branch may be unreachable \u2014 or, conversely, it may be needed to signal invalid addresses. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: - Declarations of sa_port and Accessor are ordinary local variables and are reachable. - The assignment sa_port = htons(PortNum); and the cast/assignment Accessor = (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData; are executed before the switch and are not syntactically unreachable (they depend on runtime state rather than compile-time constants). - The AF_INET case (case AF_INET: Accessor->sa_in.sin_port = sa_port; break;) is a normal reachable branch for IPv4 addresses. - The final return OS_SUCCESS; is reachable when execution flows through a case (AF_INET or AF_INET6 when enabled). - The surrounding switch structure itself is not statically unreachable because it switches on a runtime field (Accessor->sa.sa_family). Therefore these other fragments are not candidates for unreachable-code violations under MISRA Rule 2.1, although they may require other checks (e.g., null-pointer or bounds checks) which are outside the scope of unreachable-code detection."
