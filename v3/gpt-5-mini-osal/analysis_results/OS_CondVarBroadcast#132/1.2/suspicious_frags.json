  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. I inspected the snippet for tokens and constructs that are explicit compiler extensions in common toolchains (examples: __attribute__, __asm / asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), extended designated initializers, non-standard storage-class specifiers, or other vendor-specific keywords) and none are present. The identifiers int32, osal_id_t, and OS_object_token_t are typedefs/types used by the codebase, not language extensions. The function signature, local declarations, function calls, comment style, and control flow are all standard C. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
