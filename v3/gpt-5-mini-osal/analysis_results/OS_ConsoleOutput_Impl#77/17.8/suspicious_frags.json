  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the shown code. The sole function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and is only dereferenced for read access (used as *token in OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET). There is no assignment to the pointer variable token itself, nor any statement that writes through token. The local variable console is assigned from the object table and its members (e.g. console->ReadPos) are modified \u2014 that is allowed because the rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter (and here console is a local pointer, not the parameter). The helper static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token) only reads token->obj_idx and does not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
