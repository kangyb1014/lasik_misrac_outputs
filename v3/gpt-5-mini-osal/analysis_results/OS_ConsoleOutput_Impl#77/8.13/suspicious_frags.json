  "explanation": "Fragments not selected: - The parameter declaration of OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl (const OS_object_token_t *token) already uses const and does not need investigation for Rule 8.13. - The local pointer variable declaration (OS_console_internal_record_t *console;) must remain non-const because the function updates console->ReadPos, so it is not a candidate for const-qualification. - The size/position variables (StartPos, EndPos, WriteSize) are integer types, not pointers, so Rule 8.13 does not apply. - Calls to OS_BSP_Lock_Impl() and OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl() and the write loop internals do not introduce pointer declarations that could be const-qualified here. - The OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl definition already takes a const char * parameter, so that function signature itself complies with 8.13; the interest is whether the source pointer (BufBase) should be const. The listed fragments are those that warrant inspection for possible missing const qualification (structure member type, table declaration, macro usage and the call site passing a non-const buffer pointer)."
