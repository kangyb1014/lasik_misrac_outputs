  "explanation": "I inspected the function and related symbols for direct uses of the Standard Library string functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). None of these functions \u2014 nor any other functions from <string.h> \u2014 appear in the provided code fragment or in the supplied related-symbol declaration. The only string-related call is dlerror() which returns a const char* and is passed to OS_DEBUG for printing; dlerror is not part of <string.h> and printing it does not itself invoke the listed <string.h> functions in this code. The table access via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the dlclose call operate on object records and handles, not on raw string-library calls. Therefore there are no direct candidates in this fragment that could violate Rule 21.17. Note: if the macros/functions OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or OS_DEBUG (or any other referenced implementation) internally expand to or call any of the listed <string.h> functions, those definitions should be inspected \u2014 but based solely on the provided code, there are no occurrences of the <string.h> functions to investigate."
