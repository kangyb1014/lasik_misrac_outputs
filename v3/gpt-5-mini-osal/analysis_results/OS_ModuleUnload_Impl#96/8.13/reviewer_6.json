True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe member impl->dl_handle is declared as void * but is used only as an opaque handle (returned from dlopen and only passed to dlclose). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *) whenever possible. The fragment dlclose(impl->dl_handle) therefore uses a non-const pointer when a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate, so the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleUnload_Impl:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The handle stored in impl->dl_handle is the opaque handle returned by dlopen and consumed by dlclose; the POSIX prototypes are dlopen(...) -> void * and dlclose(void *). Changing impl->dl_handle to const void * would not match the external API and would force casts (casting away const) when calling dlclose, which is worse and would itself violate other MISRA rules or require justified deviations. Rule 8.13 recommends const qualification where feasible, but it does not mandate adding const in cases where the pointer must interoperate with a non-const external API. Therefore the report that this fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
