True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe macro takes the address of its token argument (&(tok)). In OS_ModuleUnload_Impl the call is OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) where token is declared const OS_object_token_t *; &( *token ) therefore yields a pointer to a const OS_object_token_t. If the downstream helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (or any caller of the address produced by the macro) is declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t * (i.e. discards the const qualifier), this discards const qualification and causes a pointer to a non-const type to be used where a const-qualified pointer should be used. That scenario violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A correct remedy would be to ensure OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (and the macro usage) accept a pointer-to-const (const OS_object_token_t *) or to change the macro to take a pointer argument instead of taking the address of a possibly-const value.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleUnload_Impl:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is technically correct about the potential const-discard, but the report as stated (that the shown code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13) cannot be confirmed from the supplied code alone. Explanation:\n\n- In OS_ModuleUnload_Impl the parameter is declared const OS_object_token_t *token and the call uses OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token). The macro expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))] and therefore takes the address of (tok). When tok is *token this yields an expression of type const OS_object_token_t *.\n\n- Whether a Rule 8.13 violation actually occurs depends on the declaration of OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (or any other function/macro parameter that receives the address). If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to accept a non-const OS_object_token_t * (i.e. it discards the const qualifier), then a const-qualified pointer is implicitly converted to a non-const pointer and that is a discard of const qualification \u2014 which is contrary to the MISRA intent expressed in Rule 8.13 (and is also a constraint violation in C). In that case Agent A\u2019s reported violation is correct and the suggested remedies (make the function/macro take const OS_object_token_t * or change the macro to accept a pointer argument rather than taking the address of its operand) are appropriate.\n\n- If, however, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (and any intervening declarations) is already declared to take a const OS_object_token_t * (or otherwise preserve constness), then there is no const-discard and no Rule 8.13 violation in the shown code.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the prototype of OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (and any related macros/functions) \u2014 if it takes a non-const pointer, change it to accept const OS_object_token_t * (and update the macro if needed). This preserves const qualification and resolves the MISRA concern.\n"
