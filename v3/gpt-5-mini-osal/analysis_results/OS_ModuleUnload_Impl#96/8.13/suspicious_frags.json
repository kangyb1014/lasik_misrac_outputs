  "explanation": "I only flagged places that create, access or propagate non-const pointers that could require review for const-qualification (local pointer declaration/use, the struct field that holds the handle, the module table definition, and the table-access macro). Other fragments in the provided code do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already const-qualified and thus does not violate the rule; dlerror() is used only as a transient read-only error string (not stored into a non-const pointer); there are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning APIs used here that would be candidates for adding const qualification. The listed fragments are the relevant locations where const qualification might be missing or where constness could be inadvertently discarded and therefore should be investigated further."
