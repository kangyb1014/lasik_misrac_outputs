  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related symbols. None of the standard <string.h> functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the target code or the supplied related definitions. Specific checked fragments:\n\n- OS_CondVarWait_Impl body: only uses pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cleanup_pop and returns status codes \u2014 no string functions.\n- The call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is an array/object lookup in context; no string functions are present in the shown code. (If the macro\u2019s hidden definition elsewhere used a string function, that definition would need inspection, but it was not provided.)\n- OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex calls pthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 not a string function.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx \u2014 no string handling.\n- OS_impl_condvar_table is an array declaration \u2014 no string usage.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation under Rule 21.17. If you can provide the definition of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or any other omitted macros/inline functions used here, I can re-check those for hidden uses of <string.h> functions."
