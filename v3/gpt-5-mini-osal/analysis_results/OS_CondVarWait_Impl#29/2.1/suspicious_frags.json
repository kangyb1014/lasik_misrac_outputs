  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are provably unreachable in the provided code. Reasons:\n- There are no unconditional returns, goto, break, continue, or infinite loops that skip code so as to make subsequent statements unreachable. Both return paths (return OS_ERROR and return OS_SUCCESS) are reachable depending on the value of status returned by pthread_cond_wait.\n- The pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop pair is properly balanced in this function; the cleanup handler only affects cancellation semantics (it may run if the thread is canceled inside pthread_cond_wait) but does not make any subsequent statements in the function unreachable in the normal, non-cancellation case.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to take the address of the token expression (&(*token) in this call), which yields the original pointer and is thus valid; there is no unreachable code produced by the macro expansion.\n- The helper functions/types (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex, and the condvar table) and the constants (OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS) do not introduce unreachable code; their use here does not create any code path that can never be taken.\n\nGiven the provided definitions and this function, there are no obvious unreachable-code violations of MISRA C Rule 2.1 to report. If you want, I can additionally check for subtle platform-specific macro expansions of pthread_cleanup_push/pop that might produce unusual control flow on a particular implementation, but with standard POSIX semantics the code contains no unreachable fragments."
