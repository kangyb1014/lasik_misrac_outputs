  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarWait_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarWait_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     * note that because pthread_cond_wait is a cancellation point, this needs to\n     * employ the same protection that is in the binsem module.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex(void *mut) is registered as a pthread cleanup handler via pthread_cleanup_push in OS_CondVarWait_Impl and will be executed if the thread is canceled (or when pthread_cleanup_pop is called with true). Its call to pthread_mutex_unlock(mut) affects program behaviour in the cancellation path by ensuring the mutex is released. Removing this function (or its call) would change behaviour (potentially leaving the mutex locked), so it is not dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
