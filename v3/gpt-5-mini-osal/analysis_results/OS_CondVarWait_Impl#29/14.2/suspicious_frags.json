First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the target function OS_CondVarWait_Impl and the additional definitions provided. There are no for statements present in the supplied code fragments (no occurrence of the 'for' keyword). Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (requirements for well-formed for loops) cannot be violated within the shown code. \n\nNotes/reasoning: \n- The only loop-relevant construct in the function is a call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, but its definition was not provided in the snippets. If that macro expands to a for loop, or if any called function (for example any macros or functions referenced but not shown) contains a for loop, those definitions should be examined separately. \n- pthread_cleanup_push/pthread_cleanup_pop and the pthread_cond_wait call are not for loops and are not relevant to Rule 14.2.\n\nConclusion: No suspicious code fragments for Rule 14.2 exist in the supplied code. If you want, provide the definition of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the implementations of any called functions/macros so they can be checked for for-loops that might need investigation."
