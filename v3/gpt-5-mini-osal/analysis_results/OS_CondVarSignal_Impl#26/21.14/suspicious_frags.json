  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other comparison of null-terminated strings) appear in the provided code fragments. The function OS_CondVarSignal_Impl calls pthread_cond_signal and returns status values; it does not perform any string comparisons. The related macros and type definitions shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_condvar_table, OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t, and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) operate on indices, integers, and synchronization primitives (pthread_mutex_t/pthread_cond_t), not on char arrays or C-strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that would need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
