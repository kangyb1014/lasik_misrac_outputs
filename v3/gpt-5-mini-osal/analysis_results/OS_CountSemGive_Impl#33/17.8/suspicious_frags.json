  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the parameter token itself. Specifically:\n- There is no assignment to token (no occurrences of token = ..., no increments/decrements ++token/--token, no pointer arithmetic involving token).\n- The only use of token is as *token in the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro argument; that dereferences the pointer to obtain the referenced object value. Dereferencing and passing the referenced object by value does not modify the pointer parameter. Any modification performed inside the macro to the expression *token would modify the pointee (the object referred to), not the pointer itself; furthermore the function prototype declares the pointee as const, so attempting to modify it would be a const-violation at compile time (unless a cast is used elsewhere, which is not present here).\n- The rest of the function operates on the local variable impl and calls sem_post(&impl->id); this does not touch the token parameter.\nTherefore, there are no fragments that should be investigated for potential modification of the function parameter under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
