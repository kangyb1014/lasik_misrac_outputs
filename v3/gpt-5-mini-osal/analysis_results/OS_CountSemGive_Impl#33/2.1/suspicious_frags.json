  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function or the related definitions. Reasoning:\n- Control flow: sem_post(&impl->id) can return either a negative value (leading to the return OS_SEM_FAILURE;) or a non-negative value (execution falls through to return OS_SUCCESS;). Both return sites are reachable based on the runtime result of sem_post.\n- There are no statements after an unconditional return, no infinite loops, no conditional blocks that can never be true/false by construction, and no switch/case constructs with unreferenced cases in the shown code.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usage (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token)) expands to take the address of the dereferenced token (&(*token)), which is equivalent to the original token pointer and does not produce dead code.\n- The related definitions (array of records, struct with sem_t, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline) do not introduce unreachable code in this context.\nGiven the shown code and related symbols, there are no fragments that appear to be unreachable and thus none require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
