  "explanation": "To determine whether the pointer parameter in OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl is correctly const-qualified (MISRA: a pointer should point to const whenever possible) the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: the prototype/definition is required to see how the 'token' argument is declared in the callee (const OS_object_token_t * vs OS_object_token_t *), and to inspect whether that function casts away const or writes through the token pointer. If the callee requires a non-const pointer or performs casts, the const qualification in the caller may be inconsistent.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: the typedef/definition of this type is needed to know what the pointer actually points to (object vs scalar) and whether it contains mutable subobjects that would require non-const access. Also needed to detect any implicit conversions or qualifiers on members.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: this helper is called (transitively) by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl according to the call graph. Its prototype/definition is required to check whether it accepts/returns or modifies the token and whether it requires non-const access or performs casts that would force token to be non-const.\n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: likewise called by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl; its signature/implementation is required to verify whether it accepts a const token or needs a non-const pointer / performs casts, which affects whether the token can appropriately be const.\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: the prototype is required to confirm the second parameter type for &ts (const vs non-const). This shows whether passing &ts as a non-const pointer is necessary (the function likely writes ts) or could be const, which affects whether the local variable is being passed correctly relative to the rule.\n\n- struct timespec: the type definition is needed to confirm whether the object passed (&ts) or its members are intended to be modified by OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime; this supports the determination that passing a non-const pointer for ts is required (and thus not a MISRA violation).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyzer determine if 'token' is properly declared const in all uses and whether any callees cast away or require non-const access (which would indicate a potential MISRA violation), and whether the ts pointer usage is justified."
