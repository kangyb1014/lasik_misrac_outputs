  "explanation": "- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: Called directly by the target; its implementation must be inspected to see if it calls any <string.h> functions or performs buffer accesses on any pointers coming from the target (e.g. does it treat the timespec pointer or other globals as character buffers).\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: Called directly by the target with the token and a pointer to ts; its body must be examined for any use of string functions that could access data referenced by the token pointer or the timespec pointer passed from the target.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl (per call graph). If it uses string functions to parse or access fields inside OS_object_token_t, it could produce out-of-bounds accesses originating from the token passed by the target.\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Called by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl; include its implementation to detect any string.h usage or buffer accesses that might operate on data reachable from the target's parameters.\n- OS_object_token_t (type): The layout and member types/lengths of this token are required to determine whether any string operations in the callees could run past member bounds (e.g., named fields or embedded char arrays).\n- struct timespec (definition): The target passes &ts to callees; the exact size/layout is needed to determine whether any subsequent operations in callees could access beyond the ts object via string functions or casts.\n- uint32 / int32 (typedefs): The exact typedefs (sizes) are needed to understand parameter sizes and calling conventions; also helpful for tracing any computations that may affect buffer sizes or loop bounds in callees.\n\nInclude the full prototypes/implementations for the listed functions and the complete type definitions so the analyzer can search those bodies for any use of standard string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strncpy/strcpy/strlen/etc.) and verify that all pointer arguments are accessed within object bounds."
