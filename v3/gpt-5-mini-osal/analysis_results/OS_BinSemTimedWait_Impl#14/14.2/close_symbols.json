The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: Called directly by the target; its body may contain for-loops or modify objects that are used in loop-control expressions. Must inspect to determine whether any for loops there satisfy MISRA well-formedness and whether they modify objects referenced in their clauses.\n\nOS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: Returned value of the target is directly the return of this function. Its implementation may itself contain for-loops (or call functions that do) and may modify objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags; its body is needed to test MISRA conditions (clauses, side-effects, objects modified in body).\n\nOS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. Its behavior (loops, side-effects, modifications of objects) contributes to the effective behaviour of any for-loops inside OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl and thus must be examined.\n\nOS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Another callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. It may contain loops or modify objects that are used by surrounding for-loops; its body is required to assess whether any loops in the call chain violate the rule.\n\nOS_object_token_t (type): The target and called functions take pointers to this type. The structure definition is needed to know which objects (structure members) could be read or modified inside called functions and whether such members are used in for-loop clauses or modified in loop bodies.\n\nstruct timespec (type): The target computes and passes a timespec to callees; the definition is needed in case any for-loops use/modify its members (either in OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime or downstream), which affects MISRA analysis.\n\nNote: In addition to the above symbols, when examining the bodies of the listed functions the analyst must also pull in any global variables, macros or other functions referenced by those bodies (and their definitions) because the MISRA rule requires accounting for side-effects and modifications performed by called functions. Those additional symbols should be added once the implementations of the listed functions are inspected."
