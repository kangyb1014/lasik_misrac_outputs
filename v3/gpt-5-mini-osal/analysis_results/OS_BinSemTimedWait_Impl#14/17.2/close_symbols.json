  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion (MISRA: functions shall not call themselves), the analysis must inspect the implementations/call-graphs of the functions it invokes and the wrapper that calls it: \n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: direct callee of the target. Must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call back into OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl or OS_BinSemTimedWait, which would form a recursion cycle.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: direct callee of the target. Its body/callees must be examined for any path back to OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl or to other functions that eventually call the target.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: a callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. Its implementation must be inspected because it could be the link that leads back to the target (indirect recursion).\n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: another callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. Must be checked for any calls that could lead back to the target or its wrapper.\n\n- OS_BinSemTimedWait: the external wrapper/caller of OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl. If any callee of the target calls this wrapper (or any other function that then calls the wrapper), that would create an indirect cycle. The wrapper and its callees should be reviewed to rule out such a return path.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their source or complete call-graph edges) is sufficient to detect any direct or indirect path from OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl back to itself (or via the wrapper), which would violate the MISRA rule."
