  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule prohibiting compiler language extensions, the analyzer must inspect any symbols that could introduce extension constructs into the target function. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- int32: This typedef may be implemented using compiler-specific extension (e.g. __int32, __attribute__, or compiler-provided typedefs). Need its definition to ensure it is a standard C typedef and not an extension.\n\n- uint32: Same rationale as int32 \u2014 verify it is a standard typedef (e.g. from stdint.h) and does not use compiler-specific extensions or attributes.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The token type could be a typedef or struct that uses extensions (anonymous unions/structs, bit-field tricks, __attribute__ markers). Inspecting its definition ensures no language extensions are brought into the function via the parameter type.\n\n- struct timespec: Although typically from the standard time.h, the actual project/system definition must be checked to ensure it does not use nonstandard language extensions (platform headers sometimes use attributes or other extensions).\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime (declaration and definition): This callee could be a macro or inline function that expands to compiler-specific constructs (e.g. inline asm, __attribute__, typeof, statement-expressions). The prototype/definition is required to ensure the call site in the target function does not rely on extensions.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl (declaration and definition): Same as above \u2014 this callee might be a macro or have attributes on its declaration or implementation that introduce language extensions into the call expression used by the target function.\n\n- OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl (external prototype/declaration if present): If an external prototype or header declares this function with attributes or compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, that would be an extension affecting the function. The external declaration should be checked as well.\n\nIn short, inspect the typedefs used by parameters/return, the struct definition used locally, and the declarations/definitions of called functions to detect any use of compiler-specific language extensions that would make the target function violate the MISRA rule."
