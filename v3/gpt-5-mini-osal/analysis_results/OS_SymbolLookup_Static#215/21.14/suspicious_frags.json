  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The function compares strings using strcmp (strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) and strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName)), which does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (the rule forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). The code also performs pointer NULL checks (StaticSym->Name == NULL and ModuleName == NULL) rather than attempting to compare NULL via memcmp. The related typedef and macro definitions do not contain memcmp either. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14."
