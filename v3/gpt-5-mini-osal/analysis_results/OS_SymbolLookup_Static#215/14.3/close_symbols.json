Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide if the controlling expression while (StaticSym != NULL) is invariant you must know exactly how StaticSym is initialized and how it can change during the loop: \n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: this symbol supplies the initial value of StaticSym. If it can be NULL at start then the loop might not execute; if it is guaranteed non-NULL the pointer value may never become NULL by simple pointer increment. Also the declaration can carry qualifiers (volatile, const, placement in ROM/section) that affect whether external actors can change the pointer or the pointed-to data. Knowing the initializer and qualifiers is required to determine if the while condition can change or is effectively constant.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: the loop uses StaticSym->Name and ++StaticSym. The struct layout determines how pointer arithmetic (StaticSym++) advances through the table and whether the table is intended to be terminated by an entry whose Name == NULL (a sentinel) instead of by making the pointer NULL. The types/qualifiers of Name and Module (e.g. whether they are volatile) determine whether those members or the pointer can be modified asynchronously, which affects whether the controlling expression outcome can change. You must inspect the struct to see whether the loop relies on an interior sentinel (Name == NULL) rather than the pointer itself becoming NULL \u2014 this is central to whether the while condition is invariant.\n\n- strcmp prototype/semantics: the code calls strcmp(StaticSym->Name, ...). To be confident that strcmp cannot modify StaticSym, its members, or any relevant global state that would alter the loop control you need the standard declaration/semantics (i.e. that it is a pure read-only comparison). If strcmp had side-effects (non-standard), it could affect whether the controlling expression is invariant.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary information to determine whether the truth value of (StaticSym != NULL) can change during iteration (or only by break), and thus whether the controlling expression is invariant for MISRA C Rule analysis."
