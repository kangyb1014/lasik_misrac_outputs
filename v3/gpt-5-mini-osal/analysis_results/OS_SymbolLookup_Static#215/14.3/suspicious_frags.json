  "explanation": "Only the while loop controlling expression is flagged for investigation. MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions; here the loop condition depends on StaticSym being NULL/non-NULL while the actual end-of-list sentinel check is performed inside the loop (if (StaticSym->Name == NULL) break;). That pattern can produce an effectively invariant controlling expression if OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is non-NULL and pointer increments never produce a NULL pointer, so the loop condition may remain true independent of the intended sentinel. Other control expressions do not need investigation for this rule: the if (StaticSym->Name == NULL) test depends on the runtime contents of the table and can change between iterations; the if with strcmp (strcmp(...) == 0 && (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(...) == 0)) depends on runtime inputs and structure contents and is not an invariant constant expression; the increment ++StaticSym modifies the loop variable (so the controlling expression is not obviously constant without further context about the table), and there are no do-while or explicitly infinite-loop constructs that would be allowed by the rule exceptions. Therefore no other fragments are reported."
