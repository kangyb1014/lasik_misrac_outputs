  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the program points where reachability depends on external configuration or sentinel semantics and therefore should be investigated for possible unreachable code or dead paths. In particular, whether the loop body executes (or becomes infinite), whether the Name sentinel is present, and how the static table macro expands all affect reachability \u2014 these are captured by the fragments above. Other parts of the function (function signature, comments, the final \"return return_code;\" statement, the simple assignments inside the blocks once they are reached, and the use of strcmp/casts within the guarded blocks) do not by themselves introduce unreachable code: their execution or non-execution is determined by the control-flow points already listed. Therefore no additional code fragments beyond those listed need separate investigation for potential unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
