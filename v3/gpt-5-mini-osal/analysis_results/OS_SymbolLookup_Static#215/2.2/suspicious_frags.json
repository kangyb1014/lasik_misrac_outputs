  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could represent dead or redundant operations depending on compile-time configuration and how OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE is defined. Specific concerns: the loop condition while (StaticSym != NULL) together with a sentinel check on StaticSym->Name, the initial return_code default of OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, the sentinel-handling if (StaticSym->Name == NULL), the pointer-to-integer cast when assigning *SymbolAddress, and the callsites that rely on distinct return codes (staticsym_status handling). These places can produce executed operations whose removal or change (for example if the static table is always an array with/without sentinel, or always NULL) could alter control flow or make some branches effectively redundant or never taken.\n\nWhy other fragments are not reported: the remaining code performs observable operations necessary for correct behavior (propagating return codes, performing parameter checks via OS_CHECK_POINTER, invoking platform-specific lookup implementations, iterating module objects, returning results). Those parts are typical control-flow and error-handling code and are not evidently dead: they affect program behavior and their removal would change outcomes. Constants and simple wrappers that are not listed (e.g. OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR/OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED definitions, OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl return-value propagation, and the OS_ObjectId handling calls) have clear runtime effects and are therefore not flagged as potential dead code."
