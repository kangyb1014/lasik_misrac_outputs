  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "This fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 if the struct members StaticSym->Name or StaticSym->Module are declared as non-const pointers (e.g. \"char *Name\" / \"char *Module\"). In the code they are only read (passed to strcmp) and should therefore be declared as \"const char *Name\" and \"const char *Module\". If the struct members are already declared as \"const char *\", then there is no violation."
