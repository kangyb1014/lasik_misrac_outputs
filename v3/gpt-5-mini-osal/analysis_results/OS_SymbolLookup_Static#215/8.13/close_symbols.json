  "explanation": "- OS_static_symbol_record_t (struct definition): The struct definition reveals the types and const-qualification of its members (Name, Module, Address). To check MISRA guidance you must know whether Name/Module are declared as const char * (or plain char *) and whether Address is const-qualified. This determines if StaticSym should be a pointer-to-const and whether the code passes non-const pointers where const would be preferred.\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (declaration): This global/initializer gives the exact type of the table source (e.g., OS_static_symbol_record_t * vs const OS_static_symbol_record_t *). Knowing its declaration is required to decide whether StaticSym could/should be declared as pointer-to-const and whether any const qualification is being discarded.\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): strcmp has signature int strcmp(const char *, const char *). Confirming the prototype ensures that passing StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module (their declared types from the struct) is compatible with const parameters and whether those struct members should be const-qualified per MISRA.\n- cpuaddr (typedef): The underlying type of cpuaddr and the declared type of the Address field in the symbol record determine whether the cast and assignment *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address affect const-qualification. You must know cpuaddr to check for any const-qualification mismatches or improper discarding of const."
