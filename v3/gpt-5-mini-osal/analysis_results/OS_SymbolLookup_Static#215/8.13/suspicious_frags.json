  "explanation": "The function parameters SymbolName and ModuleName are already const-qualified, so they do not require further investigation. The output parameter SymbolAddress is intentionally non-const because it is written to (assigned a symbol address) and therefore should not be const. No other pointer objects appear in the function. The listed fragments all involve the StaticSym pointer or accesses through it; StaticSym (and/or the pointee type and its character-data members) should be reviewed to determine whether the pointer should point to a const-qualified OS_static_symbol_record_t (and whether its Name/Module members should be const char*) in order to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
