  "explanation": "OS_static_symbol_record_t: Needed to know the exact types of the fields Name, Module and Address (e.g. whether Name/Module are const char * and Address is a pointer or integral type). The MISRA rule requires proving strcmp will only access within the bounds of the objects pointed to by Name/Module, so the record layout and types are essential.\\n\\nOS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The function iterates this table. To show strcmp on StaticSym->Name/Module is safe, the contents and termination convention of this table must be known (e.g. entries are NUL-terminated strings and the table is an array terminated by an entry whose Name == NULL). The definition/initialization of this symbol shows how long each string is and that an entry with Name==NULL exists.\\n\\nstrcmp: The rule targets standard string.h functions. You must consider strcmp's semantics (it reads each operand up to and including the terminating '\\0' and requires non-NULL pointers). Understanding its behavior is required to determine whether the calls in the target function can access beyond object bounds or dereference NULL.\\n\\nOS_SymbolLookup and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup: These callers must be examined to determine the guarantees they provide about SymbolName and ModuleName when they call OS_SymbolLookup_Static (e.g. whether SymbolName can ever be NULL or point to a non-NUL-terminated buffer). If callers validate or guarantee non-NULL, fixed strings, or enforce lifetime/termination, that affects whether strcmp invocations are compliant.\\n\\ncpuaddr: The exact type of cpuaddr (integral width / aliasing rules) and the type of StaticSym->Address are needed to ensure the cast and assignment to *SymbolAddress do not cause invalid memory accesses or undefined behavior related to pointer/integer conversions (while not strictly a string.h function, it is part of the pointer usage in the function)."
