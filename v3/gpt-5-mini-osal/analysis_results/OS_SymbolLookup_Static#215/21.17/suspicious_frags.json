  "explanation": "Do not investigate other fragments because they do not call <string.h> functions or are already guarded: - The loop checks if (StaticSym->Name == NULL) before any use of StaticSym->Name, ensuring StaticSym->Name is non-NULL for the strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) call within the same iteration. - The callers shown (OS_SymbolLookup and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup) perform OS_CHECK_POINTER on SymbolName (and symbol_name) before invoking static lookup, ensuring SymbolName is non-NULL for those call sites. - The conditional (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0) short-circuits so strcmp(..., ModuleName) is only invoked when ModuleName is non-NULL. - Other code (pointer cast of Address, incrementing StaticSym, return code handling) does not use string.h functions and so is outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The flagged fragments are the only places where string-handling functions are called and may lead to out-of-bounds or null-pointer dereference (notably, StaticSym->Module is not checked for NULL before being passed to strcmp)."
