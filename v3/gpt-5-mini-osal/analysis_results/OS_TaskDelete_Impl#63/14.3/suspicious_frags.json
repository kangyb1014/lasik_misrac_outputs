  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The only conditional constructs are: 1) if (ret != 0) after ret = pthread_cancel(...), and 2) if (ret != 0) after ret = pthread_join(...). In both cases the controlling expression depends on the variable 'ret' which is assigned the non-constant return values of library calls (pthread_cancel / pthread_join) immediately before the tests, so these are not constant/invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant controlling expressions in the function. Macro usages (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) and inline functions (OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger) do not introduce constant controlling expressions in this code. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
