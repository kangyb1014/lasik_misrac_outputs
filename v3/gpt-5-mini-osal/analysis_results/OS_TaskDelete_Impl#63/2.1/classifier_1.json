  "scenario": "No violation: both the if (ret != 0) branch and the else branch are reachable depending on the value of ret. The if-block does not contain an unconditional return/exit/goto that would make subsequent code unreachable; the comment \"fall through\" is only explanatory. Even with OS_DEBUG defined as an empty macro the if-block becomes a (possibly empty) reachable block, not unreachable code."
