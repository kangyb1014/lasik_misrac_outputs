  "scenario": "The pointer 'impl' is declared as a pointer to a non-const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t, but within OS_TaskDelete_Impl it is only used to read impl->id (passed to pthread_cancel/pthread_join). Therefore it could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl). Assigning the address of the table element to a pointer-to-const is allowed, so the current non-const declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
