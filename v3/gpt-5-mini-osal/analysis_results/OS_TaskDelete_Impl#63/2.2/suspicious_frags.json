  "explanation": "The fragments not listed above were not identified as suspicious for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 because they perform observable side-effects or are required for control flow and therefore cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. In particular:\n- The calls to pthread_cancel and the surrounding checks (assignment to 'ret' and the conditional) invoke thread-cancellation behaviour and control flow that determine whether pthread_join is called; these are side-effecting operations and are not dead.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET usage and token/index operations are used to retrieve runtime data (impl, module, task), so removing them would change program behaviour.\n- The OS_TaskDelete and OS_ModuleUnload call sequences (object-get, finalize-delete, delete hooks) implement the overall delete/unload protocol and are required for correct operation.\n- Assignments to 'ret' are used to select different execution paths (error logging vs join) and thus affect control flow.\nTherefore those parts do not meet the definition of dead code and do not require further investigation under Rule 2.2. The listed fragments should be investigated because they are either unused/no-op logging hooks or operations whose results are not used (or the function unconditionally returns success), which could indicate code that can be removed without changing behaviour."
