  "explanation": "The remainder of the function does not modify the function parameter itself. There are no assignments to the parameter variable 'token' (no statements like 'token = ...'), and the only other operations are: reading fields via inline accessor functions that take a pointer to const (they do not modify the token), performing pthread_cancel/pthread_join on the retrieved impl->id (operating on the impl local), using local variables (impl, retval, ret), and returning a constant. The OS_DEBUG macro is a no-op (empty) in the provided configuration. Therefore, aside from the reported fragments which involve taking/using the token in macros or debug calls and should be checked for inadvertent modification of the parameter or of its address, there are no other places in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 17.8."
