  "explanation": "The listed fragments are potential candidates for dead-code investigation: the static-lookup path in OS_SymbolLookup (declaration/use of staticsym_status and the conditional call to OS_SymbolLookup_Static), the entire OS_SymbolLookup_Static function (which may be unused if no static table or feature is disabled), the pointer-check macro (its expansion may be a no-op or map to assertion/abort behavior and could be compiled out), and the UtAssert_Abort function (which may be unused or only referenced by macros). These should be checked to determine if they are ever executed at runtime and whether their removal would not change program behaviour.\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated for dead code:\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl: its control flow (global lookup then per-module iteration) is clearly reachable and the status/local_status variables are used to propagate results; the loop and iterator calls perform observable actions (module symbol lookups) and are not dead.\n- The assignments and returns in OS_SymbolLookup (other than the static-lookup block already flagged) are necessary to return the result from the implementation layer and are used by callers.\n- The use of OS_SUCCESS macro and related return-value checks are integral to control flow and not removable without changing behavior.\n- The iterator API calls (OS_ObjectIdIterateActive, OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy) are observable operations that drive module iteration and cannot be considered dead without deeper system knowledge.\n\nThe investigation should focus on the reported fragments to determine whether they are indeed executed in any build/configuration and, if not, whether they qualify as dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
