  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In OS_SymbolLookup_Static the local pointer StaticSym is declared as OS_static_symbol_record_t * but is only used for read-only access (reading Name/Module/Address and advancing the pointer). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Declaring StaticSym as const OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym would better express intent and satisfy the rule (pointer arithmetic and read access are allowed on a pointer-to-const). Changing the declaration is the appropriate remediation (or alternatively making the pointed-to members themselves const where appropriate), provided this does not conflict with the type of OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE. Therefore the reported violation is valid."
