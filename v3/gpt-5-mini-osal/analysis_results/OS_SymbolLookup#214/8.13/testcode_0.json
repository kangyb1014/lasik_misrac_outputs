  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local pointer 'StaticSym' is declared as a non-const OS_static_symbol_record_t * but is only used for read-only access (reading Name, Module, Address and advancing the pointer). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. 'const OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym' or have the members Name/Module be 'const char *'), so the current non-const declaration is a violation.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_SymbolLookup code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2143.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SymbolLookup as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SymbolLookup:\n```c\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    int32 staticsym_status;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolAddress);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * attempt to find the symbol in the symbol table\n     */\n    return_code = OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * If the OS call did not find the symbol or the loader is\n     * disabled, then check if a static symbol table is present\n     */\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL);\n\n        /*\n         * Only overwrite the return code if static lookup was successful.\n         * Otherwise keep the error code from the low level implementation.\n         */\n        if (staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            return_code = staticsym_status;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_SymbolLookup code.\n",
