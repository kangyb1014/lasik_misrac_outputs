  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of known compiler-specific language extensions or keywords in the visible code (no __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific constructs). The remaining code uses standard C constructs and standard typedefs (int32_t, uintptr_t) and standard library calls (strcmp). However, compiler extensions are often hidden inside macro definitions or in external symbols/configuration (linker-provided symbols, special handles, or BUGCHECK implementations). The fragments listed above are the places that can plausibly hide such extensions (macros or externally defined symbols/handles). Those definitions should be inspected to determine whether any compiler-specific extensions are used. Other lines in the provided code are plain standard C and do not need investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the shown content."
