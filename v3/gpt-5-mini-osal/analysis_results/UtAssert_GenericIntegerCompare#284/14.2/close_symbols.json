Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Summary: To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must (a) identify any for statements in the target function itself and (b) inspect the bodies of any functions called from inside any for loop bodies because the behaviour of called functions is part of the loop body. Even though the shown target function contains no for statement, the safe analysis requires the definitions of all functions and relevant macros/types used by the target to confirm that no for loops or loop counter modifications are hidden via called functions or macros. For each required symbol: \n\n- UtAssert_DoCompare (function definition)\n  Reason: It is called from the target; if its implementation contains any for loops or modifies objects that could act as loop counters in an enclosing for, that affects compliance. Must inspect its body.\n\n- UtAssert_GetValueText (function definition)\n  Reason: Called twice inside the target. Its body could contain for loops or modify globals that are used as loop counters/control flags; must inspect implementation.\n\n- UtAssert_GetOpText (function definition)\n  Reason: Called from the target; its implementation could contain for loops or side effects relevant to loop semantics.\n\n- UtAssertEx (function definition)\n  Reason: The final return calls UtAssertEx with results of other calls. If UtAssertEx is a macro or function containing for loops or that modifies objects that would be used as loop counters in surrounding code, it matters for MISRA analysis.\n\n- snprintf (declaration/implementation)\n  Reason: Called to format TagStr. In some environments snprintf may be a macro or inline wrapper; include its declaration/implementation to ensure it does not hide a for loop or side effects relevant to loop counters.\n\n- isspace (declaration/implementation/macro)\n  Reason: Used inside the while condition. In some C libraries isspace may be a macro that expands to expressions; include its definition to ensure no hidden for loops or side effects.\n\n- strchr (declaration/implementation)\n  Reason: Used to detect '*' in Typename. If implemented as a macro or inline routine that contains for loops or side effects, it could affect compliance.\n\n- strncmp (declaration/implementation)\n  Reason: Used to strip UTASSERT_ prefix. If implemented as a macro or in a way that contains for loops/side effects, it must be checked.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_t (typedef/enum)\n  Reason: The RadixType value is tested/assigned; include its definition and its enumerators to know which values (e.g., UtAssert_Radix_DEFAULT) are used and whether they may be macros or expand to other constructs.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_DEFAULT (constant)\n  Reason: Used in the RadixType test. Need its value/definition to confirm there are no macro expansions that hide loops/side effects.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_HEX (constant)\n  Reason: Assigned to RadixType; include to check for macro complexity.\n\n- UT_IntCheck_t (typedef)\n  Reason: Type of ActualValue/RefValue; required to inspect any aliasing or definitions that might be macros or refer to objects modified elsewhere (could affect analysis of loop counters if those objects were used in a for loop).\n\n- UtAssert_Compare_t (typedef)\n  Reason: Type of CompareType; include to ensure no macro/function\u2011like definitions hide loops or modify objects used in loops.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE (macro/constant)\n  Reason: Passed to UtAssertEx. If this macro expands to code (rather than a simple constant) it might contain statements (including for loops) that affect compliance.\n\nNotes: I focused on functions/macros/types that appear in the target function call/expression graph (including standard library calls that can be macros in some environments). For MISRA Rule analysis you principally need the implementations of any function or macro that could contain a for statement or that could modify objects used as loop counters/control flags; the items above cover the direct callees, the wrapper UtAssertEx, and used library functions and relevant type/macro definitions. If further callers or indirectly referenced macros appear inside these symbols, their definitions should be obtained recursively."
