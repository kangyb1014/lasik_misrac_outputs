  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the given code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: function definition, local variables, typedef-based types (int32, osal_id_t, OS_SockAddr_t), calls to other functions, comparisons against symbolic constants, and return statements. None of the common compiler-specific extensions are present (no __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, inline assembly, Microsoft-specific __declspec, GCC nested functions, or other documented vendor extensions). Typedef names (int32, osal_id_t, OS_SockAddr_t) and application-specific macros/constants are not language extensions but normal user-defined types/macros, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for use of language extensions."
