  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Items inspected and reasons they do not require investigation: \n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or pragmas (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __inline__ spelled as compiler-specific, or nested functions) are present.\n- The use of open(), O_CREAT, O_NONBLOCK, strerror(), and errno are POSIX API calls/macros \u2014 these are platform/OS APIs, not C language compiler extensions, so they do not fall under MISRA C Rule 1.2 (which targets compiler language extensions).\n- The boolean member (bool selectable) is standard C99/_Bool (via stdbool.h) and not a vendor extension in typical C implementations.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its usage (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) are standard preprocessor and pointer operations; the slightly unusual passing of *token into the macro is legal C and not a compiler extension.\n- The static inline helper (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) uses \u2018inline\u2019, which is standard since C99 and not a compiler-specific extension in typical modern C environments.\n- Constant and macro usage (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_READ_ONLY, etc.) are ordinary C macros and integer expressions.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that appear to use language compiler extensions that would trigger investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
