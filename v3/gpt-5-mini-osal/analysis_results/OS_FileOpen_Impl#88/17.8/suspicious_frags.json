  "explanation": "No code fragments in this function appear to modify any function parameter itself (which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8). Evidence:\n- Parameters: const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode.\n- There are no assignments to token or local_path (no statements like token = ... or local_path = ...). The only use of token is dereferencing (*token) when passed into the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro; that reads the value and does not modify the pointer parameter itself. Dereferencing to read the token value is permitted; modifying the object addressed by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule (though here the pointee is const, so modification would violate const-correctness but no such modification occurs).\n- The integral parameters flags and access_mode are only read (used in switch and bit tests); they are not reassigned.\n- The code modifies impl->fd and impl->selectable, which are fields of an internal record obtained via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET \u2014 these are not function parameters, so they are outside the scope of Rule 17.8.\n- Calls such as open(local_path, ...) pass the pointer as an argument but do not modify the function parameter itself.\nGiven these points, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in the provided function. If you want, you can inspect the definition of the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to confirm it does not perform any unexpected modifications, but based on its usage here (*token) it is being used only for reading an index/value and not altering the parameter pointer."
