  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided code and selected fragments where reachability is unclear or depends on external/earlier checks or unknown constants and thus warrant investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code):\n- The switch/default in OS_FileOpen_Impl vs. the caller validation in OS_OpenCreate: the caller-side validation of access_mode may render the switch's default branch unreachable in common call paths; conversely, if other call sites exist that do not validate access_mode, the default is reachable. This relationship should be checked.\n- The OS_READ_ONLY case and the accompanying comment (\"For creating a file, OS_READ_ONLY does not make sense\") indicate a semantic mismatch that could correspond to unreachable or logically dead behavior when called with create flags; this should be reviewed in context of callers and flag combinations.\n- The assignment to impl->selectable depends on whether O_NONBLOCK can ever be present in os_perm; whether O_NONBLOCK is set can be determined by OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS or other inputs, so the branch/assignment's relevance should be checked.\n- The OR with OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS may inject flags (e.g., O_NONBLOCK) from a constant; if that constant is zero or otherwise fixed, some checks may be dead/constant-folded. This should be examined.\n\nAll other statements in the snippets (the call to open(), the error check on impl->fd, the flag checks for CREATE/TRUNCATE, the os_mode initialization, and the successful return) are reachable in normal error/success paths and do not appear to be unreachable code needing investigation for MISRA 2.1 based on the provided material."
