  "explanation": "I did not find code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this function. Rationale for not flagging other fragments: \n\n- token parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so the pointed-to type is already const-qualified. The helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const pointer and only reads the object index.\n- local_path is declared as const char * and is used read-only by open(), so it is already const-qualified.\n- impl is declared as OS_impl_file_internal_record_t * and is used to modify impl->fd and impl->selectable; therefore the pointee cannot be const-qualified.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table is an array of mutable file records; the function intentionally obtains a modifiable pointer into that table to store the file descriptor and selectable flag, so making the table or the pointer-to-element const would be incorrect.\n- The call to strerror(errno) returns a pointer to a string from the C library; while the return type is char *, it is an external API and cannot be changed here. The code does not attempt to modify the returned string.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro invocation uses *token which, via the macro expansion, effectively yields the original pointer; no temporary non-const pointer-to-data is being created that could/should be const-qualified.\n\nGiven the above, there are no obvious locations in this function where a pointer should have been declared to point to a const-qualified type but is not."
