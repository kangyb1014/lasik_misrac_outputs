  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide if UT_SetDeferredRetcode contains dead code\n\n- UtAssert_Failed\n  - The Count<=0 branch calls this. To know whether that branch has observable effect (log, abort, side-effect) or is a no-op in some builds you must inspect UtAssert_Failed implementation.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext\n  - Appears in the static call graph and is part of the assert machinery. Its behavior/context information may affect whether UtAssert_Failed produces observable effects; include it when reasoning about assert side-effects.\n\n- UtAssert_Abort\n  - UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue may call assertion/abort paths (call graph shows UtAssert_Abort). If the function can abort execution, removal of the call would change program behaviour. You must inspect abort semantics.\n\n- UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue\n  - The else-branch delegates all real work to this function. If this function is a no-op under some configurations or has side-effects (mutates global stub table, registers a return code, etc.), that determines whether removing UT_SetDeferredRetcode (or the else-branch) would change behaviour.\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry\n  - Shown as a callee of UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue. Its semantics (e.g., returning NULL, creating entries, modifying global state) are required to understand whether ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue actually has observable effects.\n\n- UT_StubEntry (stub table data structure)\n  - The concrete structure modified by UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue/UT_GetStubEntry must be inspected to see what state changes occur (and whether they affect later execution). This tells you if the else-branch is semantically meaningful.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t (type)\n  - The key parameter identifies which stub/entry is modified. Understanding its semantics (range, special values) is needed to determine whether some values of FuncKey lead to no-op behavior (potentially dead code for certain keys).\n\n- UT_IntReturn_t (type)\n  - The Retcode value passed by reference: its representation/valid ranges may influence whether the stored return value has effect. Also needed to see if sizeof/aliasing affect behaviour.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER (enum/constant)\n  - This argument tells UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue the genre of the value. If its value makes the configure call a no-op for that genre, the else-branch could be dead; include it to verify behaviour.\n\n- Call sites / callers of UT_SetDeferredRetcode (program-wide references)\n  - To decide if UT_SetDeferredRetcode itself (or parts of it) are dead you must know whether it is ever called. The provided static graph shows no callers; you must inspect the whole-program symbol table, linkage (static/global), registration points, or call sites (including via pointers) to determine reachability/usage.\n\n- Build-time configuration macros that affect assertion/stub behavior (e.g. NDEBUG or project-specific UT_* assert/disable flags)\n  - Assertions and stub machinery are often compiled out or changed by build flags. Knowing which macros are set changes whether UtAssert_Failed/UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue have runtime effect and therefore whether the branches/code are dead.\n\nIn short: to determine if either branch (or the whole function) is dead you must examine the assert implementation and build configuration, the configure-return-value implementation and the stub table types/semantics, and the actual call sites of UT_SetDeferredRetcode. Each listed symbol provides the information needed to decide if removing the code would change program behaviour."
