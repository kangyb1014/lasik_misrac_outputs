The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "UtAssert_Failed: This function/macro is invoked directly in the error branch of UT_SetDeferredRetcode. Its implementation (or macro expansion) may contain for-loops; per the MISRA rule the behavior of any for-loop called from the target must be examined to determine compliance.\n\nUtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph as a direct callee; it may be invoked by UtAssert_Failed or by UT_SetDeferredRetcode (via a macro). Its body must be inspected for any for-loops or functions it calls that contain for-loops.\n\nUT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue: Called in the normal branch of UT_SetDeferredRetcode. Any for-loops in this function (or in functions it calls) execute as part of UT_SetDeferredRetcode and therefore must be checked for well-formedness.\n\nUT_GetStubEntry: A callee of UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue. Its implementation must be inspected for for-loops because they are indirectly executed from UT_SetDeferredRetcode.\n\nUtAssert_Abort: Also a callee of UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue (and possibly used by assert macros). Its implementation must be checked for for-loops since those would be part of the target function's executed behavior.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule requires examining the behaviour of any functions called within the for loop body. Although UT_SetDeferredRetcode contains no for-loop itself, any for-loops present in the listed callees (or their callees) would be executed in the context of UT_SetDeferredRetcode and therefore must be analyzed. If deeper call chains exist beyond the listed symbols, their implementations should also be included until all potential for-loops reachable from these symbols have been inspected."
