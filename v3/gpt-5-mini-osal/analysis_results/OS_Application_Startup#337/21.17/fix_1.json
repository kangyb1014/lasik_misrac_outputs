  "explanation": "The linker error was due to an undefined symbol OS_timecb_table. I added a definition: void *OS_timecb_table = NULL; so the symbol is resolved at link time. I also included the necessary headers (stdio.h, time.h, stddef.h) and added prototypes for the external UT framework functions used by OS_Application_Startup so the file compiles cleanly. The original logic and call sequence are preserved; the probe logging still records the pointer and sizeof information without dereferencing it."
