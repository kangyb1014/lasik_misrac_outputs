  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine if the target function contains unreachable code:\n\n- malloc: The function calls malloc. To decide reachability of statements after the call we must know the actual declaration/definition/attributes of malloc (e.g. whether it is a macro or a function annotated noreturn, or replaced by a call that never returns). If malloc cannot return, the following statements and the return would be unreachable.\n\n- memset: The function calls memset. Similar to malloc, if memset is a macro or annotated as noreturn, then code after it would be unreachable. Its prototype/definition is needed to determine whether the call returns normally.\n\n- memcpy: The function calls memcpy. As with memset, its declaration/definition (or replacement via macro) is needed to know if control returns to the next statement.\n\n- UtListNode_t: The function returns a pointer to UtListNode_t and writes to its fields (Data, DataSize, Next, Prev). The type definition is needed to ensure those member accesses compile and are not optimized away or transformed into unreachable code by the compiler/analysis (for example, if the type is an empty/zero-sized type or uses attributes that change semantics).\n\n- uint32: DataSize has type uint32. The typedef is needed to establish its signedness/width for reasoning about expressions (e.g. sizeof computations, potential integer under/overflow) that could affect control flow or cause compiler optimizations that remove code as unreachable.\n\n- size_t: malloc and the sizeof expressions use size_t semantics. The definition of size_t is needed for accurate analysis of the allocation size expression and to detect integer overflows/underflows that might render code paths unreachable.\n\n- UtList_Add: The static call graph shows UtList_NewNode is called by UtList_Add. To decide whether UtList_NewNode itself is reachable in the project (a requirement of MISRA's unreachable-code check), the caller(s) must be analyzed; UtList_Add's definition is required to see whether it is ever invoked from program entry points.\n\n- UtList_GetHead and UtList_Insert_Before: These symbols appear in the caller list for UtList_Add. Their definitions may affect whether UtList_Add is used (and therefore whether UtList_NewNode is reachable). They are needed for a complete reachability analysis upward from the target function.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon: The call graph shows UtList_Add is called by UtTest_AddCommon; to determine whether the chain of calls from program entry leads to UtList_NewNode, this symbol (and its callers) must be examined.\n\n- main: Determining whether any of the calling chains that lead to UtList_NewNode are actually reachable from the program entry point (main) is necessary to decide if UtList_NewNode is unreachable in the project. The entry point (main) and its call graph are required for a whole-program reachability check.\n\nNote: The primary risk of unreachable code inside this function is if any called routine (malloc/memset/memcpy) is actually non-returning or if the function is never reachable from main. The listed symbols are the minimal additional declarations/definitions required to make that determination."
