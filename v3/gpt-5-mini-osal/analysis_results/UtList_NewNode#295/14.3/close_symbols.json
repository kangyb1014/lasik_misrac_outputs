  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: The function uses UtListNode_t fields (Data, DataSize, Next, Prev). The structure definition is needed to check if any of those fields are implemented via macros or contain inline/embedded control constructs (e.g. macro-expanded initializers or accessor macros) that could introduce invariant controlling expressions.\n- uint32: The DataSize parameter type is typedef'ed as uint32. The typedef could be a macro/constant alias that affects expression evaluation or be defined in a way that hides compile-time invariants. Knowing its exact definition rules out hidden invariant controlling expressions involving integer promotions/constant expressions.\n- malloc: Although malloc is normally a library function, some projects #define malloc to a wrapper macro or inline function that could contain control constructs (loops/conditionals). To be sure there are no invariant controlling expressions introduced by the allocation call, the exact declaration/macro must be known.\n- memset and memcpy: Same rationale as malloc \u2014 these are commonly library functions but can be macro-wrapped or replaced by inlined code. If they are macros that expand to control constructs, they could introduce invariant controlling expressions. Confirming their actual declarations/definitions ensures the target function itself does not include invariant controlling expressions.\n\nNote: The union NodeAllocator is defined locally in the function, and there are no explicit control statements (if/for/while/switch/do) in the function body. The listed external symbols are the only ones that might be macro-expanded or defined such that they introduce control expressions; confirming their definitions is sufficient to conclude whether the function violates the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions."
