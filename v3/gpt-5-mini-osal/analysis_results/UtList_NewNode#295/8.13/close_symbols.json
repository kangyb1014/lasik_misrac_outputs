  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (struct/typedef): The function assigns to and returns &AllocNode->Node. You must know the exact declaration of UtListNode_t and the type of its Data member to determine whether that member (and any pointer stored there) is or should be const-qualified. If UtListNode_t::Data is already a const-qualified pointer the MISRA issue may not apply; if it is non-const it shows a potential violation or required justification.\n\n- memcpy (prototype): The MISRA rule hinges on whether the Data parameter is read-only inside this function. The standard memcpy prototype (void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)) documents that the source is const-qualified; confirming the actual memcpy signature used in the project demonstrates that the function only reads from Data (so Data could/should be declared const void *).\n\n- UtList_Add (prototype): UtList_NewNode is called by UtList_Add. To decide whether changing the parameter type to const void * is permissible (and whether the pointer should be const-qualified \"whenever possible\") you must inspect the caller prototype/usage to see whether callers pass mutable pointers or expect to modify the buffer through that parameter. If callers treat the pointer as non-const, changing the type may be incompatible.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon (prototype): UtList_Add itself is called by UtTest_AddCommon (per the call graph). To fully assess the propagation of constness through call sites, you need to inspect higher-level callers to see what argument types/objects are actually passed (const vs non-const) and whether changing NewNode\u2019s parameter would force casts or break APIs.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): The function signature uses uint32; knowing its exact typedef (size and signedness) is necessary for a complete type check and to ensure there are no macros/typedefs that affect pointer qualification rules in this codebase.\n\n- size_t (typedef): Needed because memcpy/malloc prototypes use size_t; confirming the project definition of size_t may be required when inspecting the memcpy prototype and ensuring correct prototype matching.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the Data parameter is only read (so should be const-qualified), whether the struct field types permit const qualification, and whether changing the pointer to point to a const-qualified type would be safe across callers (no ABI/signature break or required casts)."
