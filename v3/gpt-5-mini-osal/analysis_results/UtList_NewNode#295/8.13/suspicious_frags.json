  "suspicious_frags": [
    "AllocNode->Node.Data     = &AllocNode[1];",

    "memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not indicate potential violations of Rule 8.13: the AllocNode declaration and malloc call allocate memory (the pointer is meant to refer to mutable storage), memset modifies the allocated storage (so the pointer must not be const), Next/Prev assignments and the returned UtListNode_t * are intended to provide a mutable list structure, and the memcpy destination is intentionally a non-const target. Therefore these parts do not need investigation under the rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible; the only candidates for possible const-qualification are the input Data pointer and places where that input is stored/used (the three fragments listed)."
