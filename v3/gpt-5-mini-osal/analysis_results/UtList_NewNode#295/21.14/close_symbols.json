  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: the node struct definition (fields and types of Data, DataSize, Next, Prev). Needed to know whether Data is stored/treated as a char* / null-terminated string or as opaque binary data.\n- uint32: typedef for the DataSize parameter. Needed to interpret DataSize semantics (e.g. whether it is a byte-count that might include a NUL terminator).\n- malloc: prototype/semantics to confirm allocation size and layout (to reason whether stored Data might be treated as a C string). Not related to memcmp directly but required to reason about lifetime and buffer sizing.\n- memset: prototype/semantics to confirm it zeroes only the union header (used here) and does not influence string termination semantics of the copied data.\n- memcpy: prototype/semantics to confirm data is copied byte-wise and to reason if a NUL terminator is expected/preserved when copying DataSize bytes.\n- memcmp: the standard comparison function named in the MISRA rule. Required to scan callers/callees (and other code) to see if memcmp is ever used to compare the Data buffers produced by UtList_NewNode (i.e. to check for violation: memcmp used on null-terminated strings stored via this node).\n- UtList_Add: direct caller of UtList_NewNode. Needed to see what it passes as Data/DataSize (e.g. string literal, strlen+1) and whether it later compares node data with memcmp.\n- UtList_GetHead and UtList_Insert_Before: functions called by UtList_Add. They may manipulate nodes or their Data; include them to trace whether any of their code uses memcmp on node->Data or otherwise treats Data as a null-terminated string.\n- UtTest_AddCommon: higher-level caller of UtList_Add (from call graph). Needed to trace original sources of Data (test inputs) to determine if Data originates as null-terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether data passed into UtList_NewNode is or can be a null-terminated string and whether memcmp is (later) used to compare such strings, which is the MISRA rule concern."
