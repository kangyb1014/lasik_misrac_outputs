Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig:\n```c\nUT_StubTableEntry_t *UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubEntryPtr;\n\n    StubEntryPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED);\n    if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        /*\n         * The counter on a deferred retval config indicates the number of times it should\n         * be skipped/not used.

  "scenario": "The assignment invokes UT_GetStubEntry and its result is subsequently tested and used (the code decrements StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter when non-NULL and later falls back to alternative entries). Removing this call would change program behaviour (and the function may have side effects), so the operation is not dead code."
