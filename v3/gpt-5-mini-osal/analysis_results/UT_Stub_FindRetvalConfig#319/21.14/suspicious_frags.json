  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The functions shown (UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig and UT_GetStubEntry) perform only integer arithmetic, pointer checks, array indexing and direct equality comparisons on UT_EntryKey_t (typedef'd to an integer type cpuaddr) and EntryType enums. There are no char arrays, char pointers, or any string operations or calls to string.h functions in the fragments shown, so there are no places where memcmp could be used to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 21.14 in the provided code."
