  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are syntactically or semantically invariant at compile time. The control points present are:\n\n- if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)  // after StubEntryPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(...)\n  - The expression depends on the runtime return value of UT_GetStubEntry and therefore is not a compile-time constant.\n\n- if (StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter > 0)\n  - The Counter field is explicitly decremented immediately prior (--StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter), so its value is data-dependent and not invariant.\n\n- if (StubEntryPtr == NULL)  // the fallback path after possibly setting StubEntryPtr to NULL above\n  - This depends on prior runtime logic (the previous searches and possible NULL assignment), so it is not a constant expression.\n\n- if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)  // inside the fallback constant-config branch\n  - Again depends on the return from UT_GetStubEntry and is not a compile-time constant.\n\nThere are no loops that create infinite loops nor do-while constructs with constant boolean controlling expressions. Hence none of the controlling expressions require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
