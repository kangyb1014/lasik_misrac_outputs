  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided code fragments (OS_BinSemFlush_Impl, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the OS_impl_bin_sem_table declaration, and OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex). None of these contain calls to any of the <string.h> functions referenced by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The code only uses pthread and clock APIs and simple pointer/array access; there are no string-handling operations that could result in out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for Rule 21.17."
