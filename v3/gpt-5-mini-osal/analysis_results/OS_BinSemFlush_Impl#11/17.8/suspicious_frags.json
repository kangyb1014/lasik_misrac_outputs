  "explanation": "No code fragment appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. In OS_BinSemFlush_Impl the function parameter is const OS_object_token_t *token and it is not assigned to or otherwise modified; the use OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) only dereferences token for indexing/reading and the macro ultimately calls OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&tok) which takes the address for reading the index \u2014 no assignment to the parameter or to token itself occurs. The only mutation in the function is ++sem->flush_request and calls that operate on the semaphore object (pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock) \u2014 these modify the semaphore record retrieved from the global table, not the function parameter variable. Similarly, OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(pthread_mutex_t *mut) does not assign to its pointer parameter (it passes mut to pthread APIs which modify the pointed-to object, which is allowed). Therefore there are no fragments that modify a function parameter (the pointer variable itself) that would require investigation under Rule 17.8."
