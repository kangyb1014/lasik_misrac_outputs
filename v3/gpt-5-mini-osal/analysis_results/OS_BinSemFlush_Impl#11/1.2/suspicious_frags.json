  "explanation": "I did not find any compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins are used (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __declspec, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expression, or other vendor extensions).\n- The use of \"static inline\" for OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is standard C (C99 and later), not a compiler-specific extension.\n- The pthread and clock_* APIs (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_cond_t, pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock, pthread_mutex_timedlock, clock_gettime, etc.) are POSIX library calls, not compiler language extensions; the MISRA Rule 1.2 criterion given asks to report only compiler-documented language extensions.\n- The use of volatile sig_atomic_t is a standard C type and qualifier.\n- Macros (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) and typedefs (int32, OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t) are standard C constructs; the macro performs address-of and indexing, which are standard operators.\n- There are no compiler pragmas or attributes, no use of implementation-specific integer suffixes or non-standard token concatenation, and no inline assembly.\n\nGiven the rule\u2019s requirement to report only explicit compiler language extensions, there are no suspicious fragments to report in this code sample."
