  "explanation": "No control statements with invariant controlling expressions were found in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- OS_BinSemFlush_Impl: The only conditional is\n  if (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(&sem->id) != OS_SUCCESS)\n  which depends on the runtime result of OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex and is not a compile-time invariant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements in this function.\n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: The conditionals\n  if (clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &timeout) != 0)\n  and\n  if (pthread_mutex_timedlock(mut, &timeout) != 0)\n  both depend on runtime return values and are not invariant.\n\n- Other items (macros OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_bin_sem_table, OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS, the volatile sig_atomic_t members) are not control-flow constructs and do not introduce invariant controlling expressions.\n\nBecause there are no loops or other control constructs whose controlling expressions are constant/compile-time invariant, there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
