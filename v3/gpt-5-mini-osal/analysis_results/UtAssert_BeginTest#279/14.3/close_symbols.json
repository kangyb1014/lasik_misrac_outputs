  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA C Rule \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" you must examine any control expressions that could appear in code that is called or expanded from this function and any globals/macros whose definitions affect control flow or constantness. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock\n  - Could be a macro or inline wrapper that contains loops or conditional statements. Its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not introduce an invariant controlling expression when invoked here.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - Same reason as UT_BSP_Lock: may be a macro/inline function with control expressions that need analysis.\n\n- UT_BSP_StartTestSegment\n  - Called at the end of the function; may contain control flow (loops/conditionals) or expand to other functions/macros. Its body must be checked for invariant controlling expressions.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - UT_BSP_StartTestSegment (per call graph) calls UT_BSP_DoText; include it because control expressions in that downstream routine could cause a MISRA violation attributable to code invoked by this function.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl\n  - Static call graph shows UT_BSP_Lock delegates to this. If UT_BSP_Lock is a thin wrapper, the actual control flow may be here; inspect for invariant controlling expressions.\n\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl\n  - Same as OS_BSP_Lock_Impl for UT_BSP_Unlock.\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters\n  - Global that is memset here. Its type/layout could include volatile qualifiers or bitfields that affect behavior; if any macros operate on it and introduce control flow, those must be checked. Also needed to confirm memset usage does not hide loops/macros.\n\n- CurrentSegment\n  - Array whose size is used in sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1 for strncpy and indexing. If CurrentSegment is a macro or has special attributes, its definition must be checked to rule out any hidden control expressions.\n\n- UT_TotalCounters\n  - Global whose TestSegmentCount field is read. If TestSegmentCount is defined via a macro or computed via constant expression, that could be an invariant used in controlling expressions elsewhere; its definition and type must be inspected.\n\n- uint32\n  - Type definition is needed to know integer range/representation; if any control expressions in called code compare or rely on this type, its definition is relevant for determining whether an expression is effectively invariant.\n\n- memset\n  - Standard library call; include to confirm it is not a macro in this codebase (some platforms redefine it) and to ensure no macro expansion introduces control flow.\n\n- strncpy\n  - Same as memset: verify it is the library function and not a macro/inline with control flow that could contain invariant controlling expressions.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no loop or conditional controlling expressions. The above symbols are required to ensure that none of the called functions/macros or referenced globals (including transitive callees shown in the call graph) introduce invariant controlling expressions when the target function is analyzed in context."
