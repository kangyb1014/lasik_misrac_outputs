Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtAssert_BeginTest:\n```c\nvoid UtAssert_BeginTest(const char *SegmentName)\n{\n    uint32 TestSegmentCount;\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n\n    memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters));\n    strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1);\n    CurrentSegment[sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1] = 0;\n    TestSegmentCount                           = 1 + UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount;\n\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n\n    UT_BSP_StartTestSegment(TestSegmentCount, SegmentName);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtAssert_BeginTest:\nUtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_SegmentCounters = {0}\n...\nUtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_TotalCounters   = {0}\n...\nstatic char            CurrentSegment[64]\n...\nvoid OS_BSP_Lock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Temporarily Disable/Defer thread cancellation.\n         * Note that OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl() calls write() which is a cancellation point.\n         * So if this calling task is canceled, it risks leaving the BSP locked.\n         */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Restore previous cancellability state */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL);\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\npthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the pthread_setcancelstate call disables thread cancellation and stores the previous cancellability state into OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState. OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl later restores that saved state. Removing this call would change program behaviour (thread cancellability and the risk of leaving the BSP locked), so the operation is not dead code."
