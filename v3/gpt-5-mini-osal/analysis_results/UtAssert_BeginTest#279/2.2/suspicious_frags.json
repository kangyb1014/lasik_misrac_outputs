  "explanation": "I limited the selection to executed operations in the provided code that could plausibly be no-ops, redundant, or have no effect on program behaviour and thus warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2. I did not include the following items because they are not candidates for dead-code investigation here: - Global/object definitions and initializers (e.g. \"UtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_SegmentCounters = {0}\", \"UtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_TotalCounters = {0}\", \"static char CurrentSegment[64]\") \u2014 these are initializations, and Note 3 to the rule explicitly distinguishes initialization from assignment operations. - Function signatures, braces, and comments \u2014 these are not executable operations. - Unseen code outside the provided snippets \u2014 cannot be judged from the fragments given. The listed fragments include all executed statements and API calls in the supplied code that could be redundant (for example, repeated zeroing, computations that may yield a constant if the referenced globals are never updated, lock/unlock sequences that might have no effect, and error-handling/logging branches); these should be investigated to determine whether their removal would change program behaviour."
