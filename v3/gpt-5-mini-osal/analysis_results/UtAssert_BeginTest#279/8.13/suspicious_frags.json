  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const-qualified pointers where appropriate or require non-const pointers due to modification. Specifically:\n- The function parameter is declared const: void UtAssert_BeginTest(const char *SegmentName) \u2014 conforms to the rule.\n- strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1); uses SegmentName as the source; the standard strncpy prototype takes a const char * for the source, so no const-discarding issue.\n- CurrentSegment is written to (including the explicit null-termination and as strncpy destination) so it must be a non-const object and therefore cannot be const-qualified.\n- memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters)); writes to the object via a void * destination \u2014 this is a write operation and cannot/should not be const-qualified.\n- UT_BSP_Lock(), UT_BSP_Unlock(), and the TestSegmentCount arithmetic do not involve pointer const-qualification concerns.\nThe only call that could potentially discard const (and thus should be investigated) is the call to UT_BSP_StartTestSegment with SegmentName, because its prototype is not shown here and might take a non-const char * parameter."
