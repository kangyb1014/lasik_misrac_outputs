Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided functions and selected fragments that may represent operations whose removal could be behavior-preserving under some configurations/inputs, so they warrant investigation for potential dead code. Other statements and constructs were not selected because they are required for correct control flow or are initialization/loop mechanics that cannot be removed without changing behavior: declarations and type definitions, the call to UT_GetStubEntry itself, the primary lookup/compare (if (StubPtr->EntryType == TestMode && StubPtr->FuncKey == SearchKey) { break; }), the assignment StubPtr = &UT_StubTable[Idx]; and the conditional branches that depend on dynamic values (e.g. selection of SearchLimit/SearchKey based on TestMode) are all functional and cannot be considered dead without additional evidence. Also the calls that propagate status or perform copies (UT_Stub_GetInt32StatusCode, UT_Stub_CopyToLocal) are observable operations affecting behavior. The fragments reported are those I judged worth further investigation to determine if they are genuinely dead under the project's invariants or configuration."
