  "scenario": "The local pointer 'StubPtr' is declared as 'UT_StubTableEntry_t *' but is only used for reading the object (Count = StubPtr->Data.Rc.Count;). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. Declaring it as 'const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr' (and leaving the call to UT_GetStubEntry unchanged, since a non-const-to-const pointer assignment is allowed) would avoid this violation."
