  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_GetDataBuffer:\n```c\nvoid UT_GetDataBuffer(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, void **DataBuffer, size_t *MaxSize, size_t *Position)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    void *               ResultDataBuffer;\n    size_t               ResultMaxSize;\n    size_t               ResultPosition;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_DATA_BUFFER);\n\n    if (StubPtr == NULL)\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = NULL;\n        ResultMaxSize    = 0;\n        ResultPosition   = 0;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr;\n        ResultMaxSize    = StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize;\n        ResultPosition   = StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position;\n    }\n\n    if (DataBuffer != NULL)\n    {\n        *DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer;\n    }\n    if (MaxSize != NULL)\n    {\n        *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize;\n    }\n    if (Position != NULL)\n    {\n        *Position = ResultPosition;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (Position != NULL)\n    {\n        *Position = ResultPosition;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the conditional assignment writes the caller-provided location only when Position != NULL, so removing it would change behaviour for callers that pass a non-NULL pointer (or when Position points to volatile/hardware). This is therefore not dead code as written. A specific violation scenario would be if, across the entire project, every call either passed a non-NULL Position whose target always already contained the same value as ResultPosition (and the target is not volatile or a hardware register) so the write is executed but has no observable effect; in that case the assignment would be executed yet removable without changing behaviour and would violate Rule 2.2."
