  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected UT_GetDataBuffer and the related definitions provided (UT_GetStubEntry, UT_StubTableEntry_t and UT_EntryKey_t). I found no uses of known compiler language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (for example: inline assembly (__asm__/asm), GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ constructs, typeof, statement expressions, anonymous/unnamed structs/unions as extensions, nonstandard keywords, language-specific linkage specifiers, Microsoft-specific declspecs, or other vendor-specific keywords). The identifiers uint32 and cpuaddr appear as platform typedefs (not language extensions) and UT_EntryKey_t is a typedef alias; typedefs themselves are standard C. The omitted sections indicated by '...' are not actual code in the snippet and therefore were not evaluated. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
