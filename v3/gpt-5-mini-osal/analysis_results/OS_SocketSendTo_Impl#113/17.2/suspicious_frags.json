  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not contain function calls that could produce direct or indirect recursion and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: variable declarations and simple assignments (e.g. declarations of os_result, addrlen, sa, impl), the pointer cast sa = (const struct sockaddr *)&RemoteAddr->AddrData, the switch on sa->sa_family and the addrlen assignments (these are simple control-flow and assignments, no function invocation), the comparison of addrlen to RemoteAddr->ActualLength and the immediate return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, and the final return of os_result. The provided static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is not referenced by OS_SocketSendTo_Impl as shown, so it cannot introduce recursion into this function in the present code. The listed fragments are the only expressions in the function that invoke macros or functions and therefore are the relevant places to inspect for potential direct or indirect self-calls."
