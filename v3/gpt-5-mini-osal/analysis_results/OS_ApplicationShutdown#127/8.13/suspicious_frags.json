  "explanation": "No pointer types are used in the provided code fragment. Specific notes:\n- The parameter flag is an integer typedef (uint8) passed by value \u2014 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types, so this is not applicable.\n- The comparison (flag == true) operates on integer/boolean values, not pointers.\n- The assignment OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState = OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER; targets a struct/member that is used as a scalar value here (no pointer dereference or pointer assignment in this snippet).\n- The call OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() passes no arguments in this fragment (no pointer arguments are visible). If that function or the referenced globals contain pointer-typed members, those are outside the shown code and must be reviewed in their own definitions; within this snippet there are no pointer usages to inspect for Rule 8.13 compliance.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in the provided snippet that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
