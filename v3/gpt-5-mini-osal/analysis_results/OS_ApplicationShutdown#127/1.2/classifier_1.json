  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a plain function call to OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() and does not use any compiler language extensions. The surrounding code uses standard C constructs (typedefs, designated initializers, and POSIX API calls) but none of these are compiler-specific language extensions as required to trigger Rule 1.2."
