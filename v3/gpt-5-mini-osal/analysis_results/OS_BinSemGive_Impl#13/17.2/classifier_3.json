  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET access merely retrieves the table entry for the token (it typically expands to index arithmetic or calls a small inline helper such as OS_ObjectIndexFromToken which just returns token->obj_idx). None of the shown symbols (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex) call OS_BinSemGive_Impl, so there is no direct or indirect self-call."
