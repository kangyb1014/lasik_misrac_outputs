  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement calls the POSIX API function pthread_mutex_unlock(&(sem->id)). This calls an external library routine, not OS_BinSemGive_Impl, and there is no call chain shown that would lead back to OS_BinSemGive_Impl (neither direct nor indirect recursion via OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex or pthread_mutex_timedlock). No evidence of the function calling itself exists, so Rule 17.2 is not violated."
