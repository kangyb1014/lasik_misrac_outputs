  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not present obvious opportunities to use const-qualified pointer types:\n- The local pointer variable 'OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem' is used to modify the semaphore (sem->current_value = 1; unlocking/signaling its members), so it must be a pointer to a non-const object.\n- The pthread API calls (pthread_cond_signal(&(sem->cv)), pthread_mutex_unlock(&(sem->id)), pthread_mutex_timedlock(mut), etc.) require non-const pointers because the synchronization primitives are modified by those functions; therefore these pointers cannot be declared to point to const-qualified types.\n- The global table 'OS_impl_bin_sem_table' is an array of mutable semaphore records; it cannot be const if the program updates entries elsewhere.\n- The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified and thus conforms with the rule.\n\nThe two reported fragments are the places where constness could be inadvertently discarded or where the macro forces taking the address of a (possibly const) token expression. In particular, the macro takes the address of its 'tok' parameter (&(tok)) and the call passes '*token' (a const-qualified object), so the interaction between the macro and the token argument should be inspected to ensure no const qualifier is being removed or violated (for example by OS_ObjectIndexFromToken's prototype or the macro expansion)."
