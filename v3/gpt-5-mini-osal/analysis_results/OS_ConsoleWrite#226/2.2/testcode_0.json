  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIn OS_Console_CopyOut the variable return_code is assigned OS_ERROR immediately before entering a while(true) loop that always sets return_code (to OS_SUCCESS when the end of string is reached, or OS_QUEUE_FULL when the buffer is full) before any break/return. There is no path that uses the initial value of return_code, and the function always returns a value assigned inside the loop. Therefore the statement `return_code = OS_ERROR;` is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 it is redundant (dead) code.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_ConsoleWrite code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2262.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ConsoleWrite as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ConsoleWrite:\n```c\nint32 OS_ConsoleWrite(osal_id_t console_id, const char *Str)\n{\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n    OS_console_internal_record_t *console;\n    size_t                        PendingWritePos;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONSOLE, console_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        console = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_console_table, token);\n\n        /*\n         * The entire string should be put to the ring buffer,\n         * or none of it.
