  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided target function or the related symbols. The function OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl performs only an index lookup and copies a numeric value (sem->current_value) into sem_prop->value \u2014 no string operations or comparisons occur. The helper macro and inline function (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) do not perform any string comparisons either. The only character array shown (OS_bin_sem_prop_t.name) is not accessed in the displayed code, so there is no instance of memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings in the supplied fragments. Therefore, there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14."
