  "explanation": "The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified and therefore does not need investigation. The parameter 'OS_bin_sem_prop_t *sem_prop' is an output parameter that is written to (sem_prop->value = ...), so it must be a pointer to a modifiable object and cannot be const. The global table OS_impl_bin_sem_table represents mutable semaphore state and thus is not expected to be const-qualified. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET returns the address of an element in that mutable table; while the local pointer could be made to point to a const-qualified type in this read-only context, the macro and table themselves are intentionally non-const. No other pointer usages appear in the provided code that could reasonably be made const without changing the intended mutability (e.g. output parameters or global mutable state)."
