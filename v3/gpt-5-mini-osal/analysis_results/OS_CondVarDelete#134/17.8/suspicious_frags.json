  "explanation": "No code fragment in the supplied function modifies the function parameter var_id. var_id is a scalar (osal_id_t typedef to uint32) and is only passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById, so it cannot be altered by that call per C language call-by-value semantics. The function only assigns to local variables (token and return_code) and passes the address of the local token to other routines (OS_CondVarDelete_Impl and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete). Passing &token may allow those callees to modify the object referred to by token, but that is allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). There are no assignments to var_id, no taking of its address, and no pointer parameters that alias var_id in this function, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
