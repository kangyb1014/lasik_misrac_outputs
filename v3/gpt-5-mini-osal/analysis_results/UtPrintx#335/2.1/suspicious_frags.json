  "explanation": "No unreachable-code constructs are present in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no return, goto, break, continue, or longjmp constructs that would make subsequent statements syntactically unreachable.\n- There are no constant conditional expressions (e.g., if (0)) or compile-time false preprocessor conditions that remove reachability of following statements.\n- The while and for loops use runtime conditions (i < Length and j < 16 && i < Length) and the loop-control variable i is advanced inside the inner loop, so the loop bodies are potentially reachable for appropriate inputs; skipping the loop when Length == 0 is a runtime behavior, not static unreachable code.\n- All statements in the function can be executed when the function is invoked with suitable runtime values; there is no statically dead code fragment to flag for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1.\n\nTherefore no code fragments need to be investigated for unreachable-code concerns in this snippet."
