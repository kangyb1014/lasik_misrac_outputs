  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Byte_ptr is declared as const uint8 * so &Byte_ptr[i] has type pointer to const-qualified object; taking its address and casting to unsigned long does not change the fact that the pointer points to a const-qualified type. A violation would occur if Byte_ptr were declared as uint8 * (non-const) when it could/should be const."
