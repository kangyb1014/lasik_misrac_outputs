  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n- snprintf: Called directly by UtPrintx to format the address prefix. Must be inspected to ensure its implementation (or any wrapper in this codebase) does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- sprintf: Called in the byte-formatting loop. Its implementation or any local wrapper could use memcmp; include it in the analysis to rule out misuse of memcmp on C strings.\n- strlen: Used to compute OutPtr offset. strlen itself does not compare strings with memcmp, but an alternative/wrapper implementation might; include to be sure no memcmp-on-NT-string occurs.\n- UT_BSP_DoText: The only direct non-stdlib callee from UtPrintx. Any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings inside this routine would be relevant since UtPrintx calls it to emit the text.\n- UT_BSP_Lock: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText (from the provided call graph). Include because memcmp misuse might appear in the UT_BSP_DoText call chain.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText; could contain memcmp usage comparing strings passed from UtPrintx.\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText; may perform string operations and possibly call memcmp.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText; include for completeness of the UT_BSP_DoText call chain.\n- UT_BSP_Unlock: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText; include because it is in the call chain.\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Indirect callee of UT_BSP_DoText; include for completeness.\n- memcmp: The symbol that the MISRA rule targets. Include to detect any uses in the functions above and to inspect call sites to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nIn summary: include the standard library string/format functions used by UtPrintx (snprintf, sprintf, strlen), the UT_BSP_DoText function that UtPrintx invokes and its direct callees from the static call graph, and memcmp itself so the next analyst can search implementations and call chains for any occurrence of memcmp being used to compare null-terminated (C) strings."
