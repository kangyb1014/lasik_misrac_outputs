  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for analyzing language-extension use:\n\n- uint32: The typedef behind uint32 must be known to determine whether it is a standard typedef (e.g. from a standard header) or a project/compiler-provided alias (potential extension). MISRA analysis must know if non\u2011standard typedefs or vendor extensions are used.\n\n- uint8: Same reason as uint32 \u2013 need the actual typedef/definition to determine whether it is a standard fixed-width type or a nonstandard/compiler-specific symbol.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText (declaration/definition): The function used to output the formatted string could be a macro or implemented with compiler extensions (inline assembly, nonstandard attributes, variadic-macro shims, builtin hooks). The declaration/definition is required to see whether any language extensions are introduced through that symbol.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO (macro/enum definition): This identifier is used as an argument to UT_BSP_DoText; it could be a macro that expands to compiler-specific constructs or attributes. Its definition is needed to detect extension usage.\n\n- snprintf (prototype / stdio.h): Need the standard prototype to ensure the code is using the standard C library API and not a compiler-specific variant (e.g. _snprintf, __builtin_snprintf). A missing/altered prototype could hide extension usage.\n\n- sprintf (prototype / stdio.h): Same as snprintf \u2014 check whether sprintf is the standard function or replaced by a nonstandard/extended variant on the target toolchain.\n\n- strlen (prototype / string.h): The code calls strlen; its declaration determines whether a standard function is used or a compiler/OS-specific replacement that might be an extension.\n\n- Compiler name and version / compiler documentation on language extensions: MISRA forbids compiler language extensions that are documented as extensions. To decide whether any construct is an extension you must know the exact compiler and consult its documented list of language extensions (for example, nonstandard builtins, format specifier behaviors, or implicit declarations).\n\n- Target ABI / data model (sizes of char,int,long,void*): The code casts &Byte_ptr[i] to (unsigned long) and prints it with \"%16lx\". Whether this is portable/standard or relies on an extension depends on the ABI (e.g. LP64 vs ILP32). The ABI determines if pointer-to-integer casts or using %lx to print pointers is implementation-defined or requires an extension; this is necessary to judge MISRA compliance for language-extension usage.\n\n- Any platform-specific attribute or macro definitions used in the above declarations (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec): Some declarations may hide compiler-specific attributes or macros that constitute language extensions; those definitions must be inspected to determine if the code depends on documented compiler extensions.\n\nThese symbols/environment details are the minimal set needed so the next analyst can determine whether the target function relies on any documented compiler language extensions (for example nonstandard typedefs, nonstandard library replacements, pointer-to-integer/format-specifier behavior tied to a particular ABI, or macros/attributes that are compiler extensions)."
