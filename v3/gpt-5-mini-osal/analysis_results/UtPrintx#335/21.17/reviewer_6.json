True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nUT_BSP_DoText calls strlen(OutputMessage). In the shown caller UtPrintx the OutputMessage is OutputLine[80] which is filled using snprintf and repeated sprintf calls. Each sprintf uses the format \"%02X  \" which writes 4 printable characters plus a terminating '\\0', but the code advances OutPtr by only 3 bytes (OutPtr += 3). This mismatched pointer arithmetic and use of overlapping sprintf calls (and the fixed header using \"%16lx: \" which can consume many characters) can lead to incorrect placement of the terminating '\\0' or buffer overruns. As a result strlen(OutputMessage) can read past the bounds of OutputLine and thus may access memory beyond the referenced object.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtPrintx:\nvoid UT_BSP_DoText(uint8 MessageType, const char *OutputMessage)\n{\n    char   Buffer[16];\n    size_t MsgLen;\n    uint32 TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL;\n    uint32 MsgEnabled   = BSP_UT_Global.CurrVerbosity >> MessageType;\n\n    if (MsgEnabled & 1)\n    {\n        UT_BSP_Lock();\n\n        /* Determine if the message type warrants special treatment (color/highlight/etc). */\n        switch (MessageType)\n        {\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_ABORT:\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE:\n                TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_RED;\n                break;\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MIR:\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_WARN:\n                TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_RED | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_GREEN;\n                break;\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_TSF:\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_TTF:\n                TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_RED | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_BLUE;\n                break;\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_BEGIN:\n                OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(\"\\n\", 1); /* add a bit of extra whitespace between tests */\n                break;\n            case UTASSERT_CASETYPE_PASS:\n                TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT | OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_GREEN;\n                break;\n            default:\n                break;\n        }\n\n        if (MsgEnabled <= 1)\n        {\n            TermModeBits = OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL;\n        }\n\n        snprintf(Buffer, sizeof(Buffer), \"[%5s]\", UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev(MessageType));\n\n        if (TermModeBits != OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl(TermModeBits);\n        }\n\n        OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(Buffer, strlen(Buffer));\n\n        if (TermModeBits != OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl(OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL);\n        }\n\n        OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(\" \", 1);\n        MsgLen = strlen(OutputMessage);\n        OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(OutputMessage, MsgLen);\n        if (MsgLen == 0 || OutputMessage[MsgLen - 1] != '\\n')\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(\"\\n\", 1);\n        }\n\n        UT_BSP_Unlock();\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If any ABORT (major failure) message is thrown,\n     * then call a BSP-provided routine to stop the test and possibly dump a core\n     */\n    if (MessageType == UTASSERT_CASETYPE_ABORT)\n    {\n        OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl();\n    }\n}\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n...\ntypedef uint8_t   uint8\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim \u2014 that strlen(OutputMessage) (in UT_BSP_DoText) can read past OutputLine because UtPrintx\u2019s use of sprintf/OutPtr += 3 leaves the buffer unterminated or overrun \u2014 is not correct for the normal/expected target platforms and the shown formats. Explanation and reasoning:\n\n- After the initial snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), \"%16lx: \", ...) the buffer is null-terminated and the header length L is fixed by the format. On typical platforms (unsigned long up to 64-bit) \"%16lx: \" produces 16 characters for the hex field plus \": \" \u2192 L = 18 (indices 0..17 filled, null at index 18).\n\n- Each sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", Byte_ptr[i]) prints 4 printable characters (two hex digits + two spaces) and a terminating '\\0' (5 bytes written). Because the code advances OutPtr by 3 after each call, the writes intentionally overlap by one byte; the observable string length increases by 4 on the first byte and then by 3 for each subsequent byte. For a full 16-byte line the final null terminator will be at index L + 49 (for L = 18 this is index 67), so the final string length is 67 \u2014 well inside OutputLine[80]. Thus, for the usual sizes where L is 18 the final buffer is null-terminated inside bounds and strlen(OutputMessage) will not read past the array.\n\n- Therefore, under the usual assumptions (unsigned long no larger than 64 bits and the format specifiers given), strlen will not access out-of-bounds memory and Rule 21.17 is not violated by the shown interaction.\n\nCaveats / remarks:\n- The code is fragile and has clear problems: using sprintf (unbounded) instead of a bounded function, computing the next OutPtr by a hard-coded +3 instead of using the return value of the sprintf/snprintf (number of characters written), and relying on overlapping writes are all poor practice and can lead to overflows on unusual implementations (e.g. if the header produced by \"%16lx: \" were longer than expected because unsigned long is larger than assumed). Such issues could lead to actual out-of-bounds accesses on some platforms or future changes.\n\n- Best practice (and how to fix) would be to use snprintf for the per-byte appends, check/propagate the return values, and advance OutPtr by the actual number of characters written (and guard against remaining buffer size). That would remove any doubt with respect to Rule 21.17.\n\nConclusion: the specific reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this code (as shown, on normal platforms) is not correct, although the code is unsafe and should be rewritten to avoid reliance on overlapping sprintf behavior and to use bounded writes."
