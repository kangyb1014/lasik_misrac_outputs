  "explanation": "To decide whether code inside UtPrintx is dead (i.e. its execution can be removed without changing program behaviour) we must know which operations have externally observable side\u2011effects and which do not. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: the function called with OutputLine; its presence or absence is the primary observable effect of the loop. If UT_BSP_DoText is a no\u2011op the whole formatted output may be dead; if it performs I/O, locking, timing or other side effects then the code is not dead.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: these are callees (or helpers) used inside UT_BSP_DoText (per the static call graph). Their implementations may perform I/O, synchronization, system state changes or other observable effects (including time/ordering effects described in the MISRA note). They must be inspected to determine whether the call chain from UtPrintx produces behaviour that prevents removal.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO: the constant/enum/macro passed to UT_BSP_DoText. Its value can alter UT_BSP_DoText behaviour (different formatting, routing, or conditional no\u2011ops) and therefore influences whether the call is observable.\n\n- snprintf, sprintf, strlen: standard library/formatted I/O functions used to build OutputLine. While these normally only modify local buffers and return values, they read memory (Byte_ptr) and write OutputLine; if their implementation has additional side effects on the target platform (or if their calls invoke traps or errno changes that are observable), that matters for dead\u2011code determination. Confirming their semantics on the target platform is necessary to establish that the formatting work has no external effect beyond the UT_BSP_DoText call.\n\n- uint32, uint8: typedefs (width/signedness) used for loop bounds and indexing. The exact sizes matter to reason about loop termination, possible integer wrap/overflow, and whether branches are ever taken (which affects reachability of code). MISRA dead\u2011code analysis requires confirming the loop actually executes as written for relevant inputs.\n\n- platform_pointer_size, platform_unsigned_long_size: platform properties (sizeof(void*), sizeof(unsigned long) and related pointer-to-integer conversion behavior). The code prints (unsigned long)&Byte_ptr[i] using %lx; if pointer-to-unsigned-long conversion is implementation\u2011defined or causes truncation/UB on this platform, this could affect behaviour (e.g. generate different output or runtime faults). Also pointer size interacts with how the formatted output is produced; platform I/O behaviour and representation can be observable.\n\nIn sum: to judge whether the loop body (formatting + UT_BSP_DoText call) is dead code you must examine UT_BSP_DoText and its callees for observable effects, confirm the constant argument used, check the standard library formatting functions' semantics on the target, and verify type/ABI/platform details that affect loop behaviour and I/O. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to make that determination."
