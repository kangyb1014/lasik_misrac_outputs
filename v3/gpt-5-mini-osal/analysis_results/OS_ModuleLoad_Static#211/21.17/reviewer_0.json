True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE is a fixed-length array without a guaranteed sentinel element (an element whose Name == NULL) within the array bounds, the ++StaticSym increment can advance the pointer past the array end. A subsequent evaluation of StaticSym->Module followed by strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) would then dereference memory beyond the bounds of the array or of the Module string pointer, causing an out-of-bounds access by the string function. Also, the loop condition while (StaticSym != NULL) does not prevent overrunning a non-sentinel array because incrementing an array pointer does not produce a NULL pointer, so the code relies on a sentinel. Thus, the fragment can lead to a Rule 21.17 violation when the sentinel is absent or not within bounds.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleLoad_Static:\ntypedef const struct\n{\n    const char *Name;\n    void (*Address)(void);\n    const char *Module;\n} OS_static_symbol_record_t\n...\n#define OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The loop as written relies on a sentinel element (an entry with Name == NULL) being present within the bounds of the OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE. The while (StaticSym != NULL) condition does not prevent overrunning a fixed-size array: incrementing an array pointer will not produce a NULL pointer, so if the sentinel is absent the code will advance the pointer past the array. At that point dereferencing StaticSym to evaluate StaticSym->Module (and later calling strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName)) can access memory outside the bounds of the array or produce an invalid Module pointer; passing such an out\u2011of\u2011bounds or invalid pointer to strcmp can cause the string function to read beyond the bounds of the referenced object, which is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids. To comply, the code must ensure a valid sentinel within bounds or use an explicit element count or an end pointer check before dereferencing and calling string functions."
