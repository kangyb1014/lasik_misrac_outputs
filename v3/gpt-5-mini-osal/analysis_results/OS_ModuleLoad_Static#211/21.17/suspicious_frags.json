  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> function in this function is the strcmp call; there are no other calls to memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn/etc. in the provided code. The rest of the function consists of simple declarations, a sentinel check (StaticSym->Name == NULL), and control-flow/return logic which do not themselves invoke or manipulate stdlib string functions and therefore do not directly create additional string-access risks beyond those related to the reported fragments. The provided typedef and macro definitions do not call any string functions either. Investigate the listed fragments to determine whether pointer parameters passed to the string function can ever be NULL or point outside the referenced object bounds (including cases where the static table sentinel may be missing or the caller provides a non-terminated or NULL ModuleName)."
