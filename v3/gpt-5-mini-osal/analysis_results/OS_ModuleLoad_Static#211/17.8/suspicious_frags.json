  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter ModuleName. ModuleName is declared as const char * and is only used as an argument to strcmp (read-only). There are no assignments to ModuleName (no ModuleName = ..., no ++ModuleName, no decrement or other modification). The only pointer increment (++StaticSym) applies to a local variable (StaticSym), not to a function parameter. The struct fields referenced (StaticSym->Module, StaticSym->Name) are pointer members but are only read or compared; there are no writes to them in this function. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
