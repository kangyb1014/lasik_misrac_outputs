  "explanation": "I selected the typedef, the table macro, and all places in the function that access or advance the pointer to the static symbol table because Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers point to const-qualified types. The typedef is notable because it embeds a top-level const in the type alias (typedef const struct { ... } OS_static_symbol_record_t), which can obscure whether variables of that typedef and the actual static table object have the required const qualification; the macro that names the table (OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) must be checked to ensure the underlying object has matching const qualification. The assignment to StaticSym and subsequent dereferences, comparisons and pointer increment are the use-sites that need to be verified against the actual declaration of the table and its element types. Other fragments in the code do not need investigation for this rule: the function parameter ModuleName is already const-qualified, the struct members Name and Module are declared as const char*, and strcmp accepts const char* arguments; the function pointer Address is a pointer-to-function where const-qualification of the pointed-to function type is not applicable in the same sense as object pointer qualification. Therefore only the listed fragments require further inspection to confirm compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
