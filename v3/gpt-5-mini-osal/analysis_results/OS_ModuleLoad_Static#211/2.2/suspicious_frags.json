  "explanation": "I limited suspicious fragments to the loop and its termination/advancement logic and the Module-name match, because these are the code areas most likely to contain executed-but-redundant operations in this function. Rationale for not reporting other fragments:\n\n- The initial assignment of return_code and StaticSym (int32 return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND; OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE;) is required for correct return semantics and to set up the traversal; removing them would change behaviour.\n- The NULL-guard around Module in the strcmp call is necessary to avoid undefined behaviour; the strcmp call itself is conditional and not dead unless the Module field is always NULL, which cannot be assumed from the provided code.\n- The ++StaticSym; is reported because pointer advancement together with the loop condition and the Name sentinel can create situations where one of those checks is redundant; that interaction should be investigated. (The rest of the function relies on correct traversal and the distinction between a NULL table pointer vs. a sentinel Name==NULL.)\n- In the surrounding OS_ModuleLoad code, uses of filename_status, object allocation/finalization, and setting module_type are all control-essential and have observable effects; they are not dead code.\n\nInvestigate the listed fragments to determine whether the while-condition, the Name sentinel check, pointer increment, and the Module/match branch are redundant in some configurations (e.g. when the static symbol table is represented differently or is always non-NULL), which could constitute dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
