  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. None of the function parameters are assigned to or otherwise modified in this function body: \n- FuncKey is only used as an argument to other functions (no assignment or mutation). \n- FunctionName is a const char * parameter (the const qualifier prevents modification of the pointed-to characters and the pointer itself is not assigned). \n- DefaultHandler is only read and forwarded; it is not assigned to or altered. \n- VaList is forwarded to UT_DefaultStubImplWithArgs but not assigned to or modified in this function.\n\nNote on va_list: Although some implementations define va_list as an array type (which is adjusted to a pointer when used as a parameter), this function does not perform any assignment to VaList itself. Any potential modification of the va_list object by callees is outside the scope of this function and would need to be inspected in those callee implementations, not here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
