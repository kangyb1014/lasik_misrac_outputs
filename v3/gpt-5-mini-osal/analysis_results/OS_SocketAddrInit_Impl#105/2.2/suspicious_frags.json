  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 because they perform operations that clearly affect program behaviour: the assignments in the OS_SocketDomain_INET and (when enabled) OS_SocketDomain_INET6 cases set the family and addrlen values that are later used to populate the address and decide success; the addrlen check and subsequent return are used to detect unsupported domains; memset(Addr, 0, ...) initializes the address structure and is not a candidate for dead code; the Accessor assignment and the final Accessor->sa.sa_family write are used to set the resulting socket address family; the case break statements in the non-default cases control switch flow and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. The default case\u2019s addrlen = 0 is necessary to ensure the subsequent check causes an error return, so it is not flagged above."
