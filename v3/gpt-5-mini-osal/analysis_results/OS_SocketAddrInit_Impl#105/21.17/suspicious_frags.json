  "explanation": "The only standard library string.h call in this function is the memset call, which must be checked to ensure Addr actually points to an object at least sizeof(OS_SockAddr_t) bytes long and is not NULL. The subsequent lines that take the address of Addr->AddrData, cast it to an accessor type, and then write into Accessor->sa.sa_family and set Addr->ActualLength are included because they may relate to or reveal out-of-bounds issues caused by the earlier memset or by mismatched/insufficient storage for Addr->AddrData (i.e. they are the memory accesses that could be out-of-bounds). Other fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not call any of the string.h functions nor perform memory copies/writes via pointer parameters: variable declarations and simple scalar assignments (sa_family, addrlen), the switch/case logic that sets sa_family and addrlen (these only compute sizes using sizeof on well-known socket structures), the conditional check if (addrlen == 0), and the return statements. These are ordinary control-flow and local computations that do not by themselves cause accesses beyond object bounds under the scope of Rule 21.17."
