  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n- The function parameter Addr is written to (memset(Addr, ...); Addr->ActualLength = ...), so it must be a pointer to a non-const object; making it a pointer-to-const would be incorrect.\n- The Accessor pointer is assigned from &Addr->AddrData and is used to modify Accessor->sa.sa_family; it therefore must refer to a mutable object and cannot be const-qualified.\n- There are no other pointer variables in the function that are only read; all pointer usage in this function involves modification of the pointed-to object (or passing to memset which expects a void*). Thus there are no places where a pointer could be changed to point to a const-qualified type without altering intended behavior.\n- The cast (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData is a type conversion but does not imply that the resulting pointer should be const; it is used to write into the address storage.\nGiven the observable code and its use of the pointers to perform modifications, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate under Rule 8.13."
