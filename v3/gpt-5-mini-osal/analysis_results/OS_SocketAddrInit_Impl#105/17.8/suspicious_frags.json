  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned in this function. Specifically:\n- Addr is only dereferenced and its pointee is modified (memset(Addr, ...), Addr->ActualLength = ..., Accessor->sa.sa_family = ...). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8; what is prohibited is assigning to the pointer parameter itself (e.g., Addr = ...), which does not occur here.\n- Accessor is a local pointer variable that is assigned from &Addr->AddrData; this assignment does not modify the parameter Addr itself.\n- Domain is only read in the switch (switch (Domain)) and never assigned to, so the parameter is not modified.\n- The OSAL_SIZE_C macro is a cast and does not modify any parameter.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation for this rule."
