  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for analyzing unreachable code in OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl:\n\n- OS_SocketDomain_t: The switch expression type. You must know its definition (enum or typedef) and the set of possible values to decide whether some switch labels/default can ever be selected.\n\n- OS_SocketDomain_INET: The first case label. Needed to know the concrete value(s) and whether callers or the type make this case reachable.\n\n- OS_SocketDomain_INET6: The IPv6 case label. Required to determine if that case can be selected at runtime (and therefore whether the associated block is reachable).\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: Controls whether the IPv6 case is compiled in. If this macro is not defined then the IPv6 case is absent (so that source text is not part of the translation unit) and may affect whether any code is actually unreachable. You must know its definition in the build configuration.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The function zeros and updates fields of this structure. Knowing its layout (presence and type of AddrData and ActualLength fields) is necessary to confirm that assignments are meaningful and to reason about side-effects, but primarily to ensure no hidden constraints force particular Domain values.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The accessor type used to write into Addr->AddrData; its definition (including the sa member and sa_family field) is needed to ensure those writes are valid and to check for any invariants that might restrict Domain values.\n\n- sa_family_t: The type assigned to Accessor->sa.sa_family. Understanding its width/range may be relevant for determining if certain assignments are no-ops or constrained in a way that makes code unreachable.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: Values assigned in the Inet/Inet6 cases. Knowing these constants confirms that addrlen is set to a non-zero value in those cases (affecting whether the subsequent if (addrlen == 0) branch is reachable).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6: Their sizeof() results are used to set addrlen. You need to know these sizes to confirm addrlen is non-zero in the corresponding cases (so the early return for addrlen == 0 cannot be triggered for a valid case).\n\n- OSAL_SIZE_C: Macro used when setting Addr->ActualLength. Its semantics may affect whether the assignment is a no-op or triggers compile-time conditions that influence reachability analysis.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and OS_SUCCESS: Return codes used by the function. Required to determine which return statements are executed under which conditions (to mark blocks as reachable/unreachable).\n\n- OS_SocketAddrInit and OS_SocketAccept: The callers (from the static call graph). To decide if any switch branch (including default) is unreachable in the whole project, inspect how these callers invoke OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl and what Domain values they pass. If all callers only ever pass one enumerator, other cases may be unreachable.\n\nIn summary: to decide whether any branch or path in OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl is unreachable you must know (a) the compiled-in switch labels (OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6), (b) the domain enumerators and their possible values, (c) the callers and what values they pass, and (d) the constants/types used to set addrlen and sa_family so you can determine whether the early-return path (addrlen == 0) or other branches can actually occur."
