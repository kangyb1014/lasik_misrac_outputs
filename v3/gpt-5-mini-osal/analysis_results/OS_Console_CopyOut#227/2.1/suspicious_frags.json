  "explanation": "I found no statically unreachable code fragments in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- The while (true) loop contains two explicit exit points (the if (*pmsg == 0) branch and the if (WriteOffset == console->ReadPos) branch). Each exit sets return_code prior to break, so the break targets are reachable depending on runtime data. \n- The final return return_code; is reachable after the loop exits via one of those breaks. There is no code after that return that would be unreachable. \n- All statements in the function can be reached along some execution path (initializations, buffer write and wrap, pointer increment, break branches). The initialization return_code = OS_ERROR is potentially overwritten before any return, but that is not unreachable code (it is simply a possibly redundant assignment).\n\nIf you want investigation of runtime-related issues (for example: Str being NULL, a missing string terminator causing an infinite loop at runtime, or buffer size/ReadPos invariants), those are runtime/validation concerns but do not create statically unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1; indicate if you want me to flag those separately."
