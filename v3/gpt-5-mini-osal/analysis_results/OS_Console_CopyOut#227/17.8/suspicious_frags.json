  "explanation": "No function parameter pointer is modified in this function. The parameters are: console (OS_console_internal_record_t *), Str (const char *), and NextWritePos (size_t *). The code does not assign to any of these parameter variables themselves \u2014 there are no statements like console = ..., Str = ..., or NextWritePos = ....\n\nOnly the objects pointed to by pointer parameters are modified, which is allowed by the rule: console->BufBase[WriteOffset] = *pmsg; and *NextWritePos = WriteOffset; The initial read WriteOffset = *NextWritePos; only reads the pointed object. The local pointer pmsg is assigned from Str and incremented (++pmsg); because pmsg is a local variable (not a parameter), modifying it does not violate Rule 17.8.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
