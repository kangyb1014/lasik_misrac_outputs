  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_Console_CopyOut modifies any function parameter itself (which would violate the MISRA rule) the analyser must know the exact types and qualifiers of the objects the parameters refer to:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t (complete struct definition): needed to determine what kind of object 'console' points to and whether accesses like console->BufBase[...] and console->ReadPos are modifications of the object pointed to (allowed) or actually reassignments of the parameter (disallowed). The struct layout also clarifies whether fields are themselves pointers, const, or have other qualifiers that affect mutability.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufBase: the type and const-qualification of BufBase (e.g., char * vs const char *) determine whether writing console->BufBase[WriteOffset] modifies a mutable object (permitted) or attempts to modify an object declared const (which could be a different MISRA concern).\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufSize: needed to confirm the type used in the bounds test (WriteOffset >= console->BufSize) and to ensure this access is a read of the pointed object's member (allowed) and not a hidden modification of the parameter itself.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::ReadPos: required to confirm that comparing WriteOffset == console->ReadPos and not assigning to console (the parameter) is only reading the pointed object's member (allowed), and to understand the semantics of that member.\n\n- size_t (typedef / header): to verify the type of NextWritePos and WriteOffset and confirm that the assignment *NextWritePos = WriteOffset modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (allowed) rather than reassigning the pointer itself (disallowed).\n\n- int32 (typedef): included for completeness to understand the return type but mainly to ensure no hidden qualifiers affect parameter handling.\n\n- definition of 'true': to rule out any surprising macro that could have side effects (e.g., if 'true' were defined oddly in the project headers). In ordinary code 'true' is a boolean literal with no side effects; this check removes the unlikely possibility that while(true) is hiding a parameter modification.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the function reassigns any incoming pointer parameters (console, Str, NextWritePos) themselves, versus only modifying the objects they point to (which is allowed by the cited MISRA rule)."
