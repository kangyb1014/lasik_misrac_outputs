  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the MISRA rule (memcmp on null-terminated strings):\n\n- memcmp: The specific Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule. The analyzer must search for any direct uses of memcmp in this translation unit or via macros/wrappers to decide if memcmp is comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- <string.h>: Header that declares memcmp (and potential macros/wrapper definitions). Needed to detect macro redefinitions or header-level aliases that could hide uses of memcmp.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t: Full struct/type definition is required to understand the types and semantics of the console buffer fields used by OS_Console_CopyOut. Whether the buffer is a C-style null-terminated string or a ring buffer matters for determining if a memcmp would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufBase: The type and interpretation of BufBase (e.g., char * vs. uint8_t *) determines whether comparisons against this buffer are string comparisons. If BufBase is not a null-terminated C string, memcmp use on it may not violate the rule.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufSize: Knowing BufSize shows the buffer is bounded and used as a ring (wrap-around logic). This helps establish that the code treats the buffer as a circular byte buffer rather than a null-terminated string.\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::ReadPos: ReadPos combined with WriteOffset/BufSize indicates ring-buffer semantics; needed to reason whether any string-termination assumptions exist that would make memcmp misuse possible.\n\n- OS_ConsoleWrite: The immediate caller of OS_Console_CopyOut (per the call graph). The analyzer should inspect this caller to ensure memcmp isn't used in combination with OS_Console_CopyOut in a way that results in comparing null-terminated strings across the call boundary or that memcmp usage is hidden in wrapper code.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_QUEUE_FULL: Return-code constants used by the function. Included so the analyzer can fully resolve semantics of return values while scanning related code paths (not directly required for the memcmp rule, but useful for a complete local analysis).\n\n- size_t and int32: Type definitions used in the function signature and local variables. Knowing these types is necessary to parse and understand pointer/length semantics when reasoning about string vs. byte-buffer operations.\n\nNotes: The primary required symbol to check the MISRA rule is memcmp (and any aliases/macros). The console struct and its members are required to determine whether the buffer is a null-terminated string (where memcmp use would be disallowed) or a circular byte buffer (where memcmp use would not be a null-terminated-string comparison). Inspecting OS_ConsoleWrite and included headers helps find indirect or hidden usages of memcmp that the target function analysis must consider."
