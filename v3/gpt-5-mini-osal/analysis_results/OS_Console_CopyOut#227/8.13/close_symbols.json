  "explanation": "- OS_console_internal_record_t (complete struct definition): needed to see which members are pointers and whether the struct or its members are already const-qualified. The MISRA pointer-to-const check depends on the actual member types and qualifiers in the struct.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufBase (declaration/type of BufBase): required to determine whether BufBase is a writable pointer (e.g., char * or uint8_t *) or a pointer-to-const (e.g., const char *). The function writes into BufBase[], so this is the primary symbol to check for any pointer-to-const violation.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::BufSize (declaration/type): although not a pointer, its type is needed to understand indexing/wrap arithmetic and to confirm whether any pointer-like typedefs are involved; it also helps judge whether the buffer semantics require non-const access.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t::ReadPos (declaration/type): to determine its type and whether comparisons/use with WriteOffset imply any pointer-to-const considerations (and to confirm whether its declaration would force BufBase to be mutable).\n- typedefs used by the struct members (e.g., uint8/uint8_t/char/size_t/uint32 etc.): resolving these typedefs is necessary to know the exact pointer element types and const-qualification (for example, whether BufBase is declared as const uint8_t * or uint8_t *). Without the resolved typedefs you cannot conclude whether the function should have used const-qualified pointers."
