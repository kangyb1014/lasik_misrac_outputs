  "explanation": "No code fragments in OS_SetSocketDefaultFlags_Impl are provably unreachable. Explanation: \n- The conditional branches depend on the runtime return value of fcntl; both the (os_flags == -1) branch and the else branch (and the nested F_SETFL error handling) can be executed depending on the result of the system calls, so neither branch is statically unreachable. \n- The final statement impl->selectable = true; is executed unconditionally at the end of the function and is therefore reachable. \n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array lookup using the token index; although misuse of the token could cause undefined behavior at runtime, that does not make any code statically unreachable. \n- The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty; its removals are compile-time elisions of debugging calls, not unreachable code paths left behind. \nGiven the above, there are no code fragments here that should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
