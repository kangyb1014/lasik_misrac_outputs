  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no identifiers or keywords that are compiler extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, __volatile__, asm, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or compiler-specific keywords).\n- The macros shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_DEBUG) use only standard C macro facilities; the variadic macro form (OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) is a standard C99 feature, not a compiler extension.\n- The use of bool/true/false corresponds to standard C99's stdbool.h, not a compiler extension.\n- Use of POSIX APIs and symbols (fcntl, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, strerror, errno) are platform/library interfaces, not language/compiler extensions required to be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2.\n- The macro expansion that takes the address of its parameter (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) using &(tok)) is valid standard C usage when the caller provides an lvalue; it is not a language extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that, based on the supplied code and symbol definitions, should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
