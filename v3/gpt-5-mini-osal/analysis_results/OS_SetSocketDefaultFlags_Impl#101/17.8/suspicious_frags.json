  "explanation": "I found no fragments that modify the function parameter or the pointer itself. Details:\n- The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token; the code only dereferences it to obtain a value (*token) for OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and does not assign to *token or to token itself.\n- There is no statement reassigning token or writing through token; only reads occur from the token.\n- The subsequent operations (fcntl calls, errno/strerror, OS_DEBUG) do not modify the parameter.\n- The assignment impl->selectable = true modifies the file-record pointed to by impl (obtained from the global table), not the function parameter or the object pointed to by token; modifying objects reachable via other means is allowed under the rule.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
