  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where applicable or involve objects that must be modifiable. Specifically: the function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t * (so the incoming token pointer is const-qualified); the calls to fcntl use integer values and do not involve pointer-to-data that could be const-qualified; impl->selectable is explicitly assigned (so the referenced record must be mutable and impl cannot be const); the global OS_impl_filehandle_table is declared as a mutable array of records (so returning a non-const pointer to its elements can be necessary); strerror(errno) returns a char * from the C library and is used only for diagnostic output; OS_DEBUG is a no-op macro here. Therefore these parts do not present additional concerns under Rule 8.13."
