  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe parameter 'void *data' is not const-qualified even though OS_NotifyEvent merely forwards it to EventHandler and does not modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be declared as 'const void *data' (and the EventHandler prototype adjusted accordingly) unless mutation of the pointed-to object is required.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_NotifyEvent code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1313.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_NotifyEvent as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NotifyEvent:\n```c\nint32 OS_NotifyEvent(OS_Event_t event, osal_id_t object_id, void *data)\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL)\n    {\n        status = OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler(event, object_id, data);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_NotifyEvent code.\n",
