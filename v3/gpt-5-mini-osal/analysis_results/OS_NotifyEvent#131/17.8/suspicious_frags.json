  "explanation": "No parameter is modified in OS_NotifyEvent. The function body contains no assignments to the parameters (no statements like event = ..., object_id = ..., or data = ...), no use of increment/decrement on them, and no reassignment of the pointer parameter data. The only use of the parameters is to pass them by value to the function pointer EventHandler; passing arguments does not modify the caller's parameters. The object referred to by the pointer parameter (data) might be modified by the callee (EventHandler), which is permitted by Rule 17.8; that would be a concern for the EventHandler implementation itself, not for OS_NotifyEvent. The global initialization of EventHandler to NULL is unrelated to modification of function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
