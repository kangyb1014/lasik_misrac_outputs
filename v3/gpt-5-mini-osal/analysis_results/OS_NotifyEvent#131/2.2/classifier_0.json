  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NotifyEvent:\n```c\nint32 OS_NotifyEvent(OS_Event_t event, osal_id_t object_id, void *data)\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL)\n    {\n        status = OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler(event, object_id, data);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nelse\n{\n    status = OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The else branch assigns status = OS_SUCCESS when OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler == NULL, providing a defined return value. Removing this assignment would change behavior (status would be uninitialized and returning it would be undefined behavior), so the operation is not dead code. (If EventHandler were statically guaranteed non\u2011NULL, the branch would be unreachable \u2014 unreachable code is distinct from dead code per the rule.)"
