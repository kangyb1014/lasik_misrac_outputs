Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code. If you do not find any suspicious code fragments, return an empty list for suspicious_frags\n- explanation: The explanation of why other code fragments should NOT be investigated.\nIt is very important to not miss any suspicious code fragments, so please give a sufficient explanation why other code fragments should not be investigated.\nDO NOT give any explanation for the selected suspicious code fragments.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NotifyEvent:\n```c\nint32 OS_NotifyEvent(OS_Event_t event, osal_id_t object_id, void *data)\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL)\n    {\n        status = OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler(event, object_id, data);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease find suspicious code fragments in the code and report them. Other agents can not investigate other fragments that you do not report, so it is very important to find all suspicious fragments without missing any.

  "explanation": "The function is small and the only executed operations that could plausibly be redundant (dead) are the local variable declaration, the two assignments to status, and the return of that variable. Structural elements such as the function signature, parameter list, and braces are necessary for correct compilation and are not candidates for dead code. There are no unreachable constructs (no immediate returns, conditional compilation hiding code, or code after a guaranteed infinite loop) in this snippet, so no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.2."
