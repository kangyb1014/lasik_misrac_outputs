  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the controlling expression (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL) depends on the runtime value of the function-pointer variable OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler, so it is not invariant. (It would only violate Rule 14.3 if EventHandler were a compile-time or otherwise invariant constant, e.g. #define EventHandler NULL or a const object that never changes.)"
