  "explanation": "No language extensions are evident in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs: a normal function definition, a local variable declaration, a void* parameter, NULL, a function-pointer call via a struct member, and a standard return. The types shown (int32, OS_Event_t, osal_id_t) appear to be typedefs or user-defined types rather than compiler-specific built-ins; their presence alone does not indicate a language extension. There are no compiler-extended keywords or features (for example no inline assembly, no GCC/Clang attributes, no typeof, no statement expressions, no __extension__ markers, no nonstandard storage-class specifiers, and no other vendor-specific syntax) in the fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that, based on the text shown, should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
