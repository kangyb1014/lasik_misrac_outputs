  "explanation": "The function body contains only local variable declarations, comparisons, arithmetic operations, assignments, and a return statement. There are no function-call expressions (no identifier followed by parentheses that would indicate a call), no function-pointer dereferences, and no calls to other functions that could form an indirect recursion chain. The identifiers used (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY, POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax/Min) are object or constant references, not calls. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that could violate Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect calls to itself)."
