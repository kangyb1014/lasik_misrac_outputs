  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (MISRA rule: pointers should be const-qualified when possible):\n\n- osal_priority_t\n  - Need the typedef/underlying type to determine whether InputPri is an integer type or a pointer type. If it were (mistakenly) a pointer type, the const-qualification rule could apply; if it is an integer type then the pointer rule is not applicable.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY\n  - The macro value and type (integer constant) are required to understand the arithmetic and any implicit type conversions. Also confirm it is not a pointer or expression that yields a pointer type.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - The declaration of this global object is required to determine its type and any qualifiers (e.g., whether it is declared const or a pointer). The MISRA pointer-const rule could be implicated if POSIX_GlobalVars itself is a pointer type or if it refers to pointer members.\n\n- type/definition of POSIX_GlobalVars (the struct/typedef that declares .PriLimits)\n  - The full struct/typedef definition is needed to inspect the types of its members and to see whether the object or its members are pointers that should be const-qualified.\n\n- type/definition of PriLimits (the struct/typedef that declares PriorityMax and PriorityMin)\n  - PriLimits' definition reveals the exact types of PriorityMax and PriorityMin (e.g., int, uint8_t, pointers). If either is a pointer type, the const-qualification requirement must be checked. Also needed to see any const qualifiers already present.\n\n- PriorityMax and PriorityMin\n  - The declarations and types of these members are required to confirm they are scalar integer types (most likely) and not pointer types. If they are pointers (or reference types), MISRA-C const-pointer rules would apply; if they are integers, then the specific MISRA pointer rule is irrelevant for this function.\n\nSummary: OS_PriorityRemap itself uses no explicit pointer variables, so to decide whether the MISRA pointer-const rule is relevant we must inspect the types/definitions of the identifiers it references (osal_priority_t, POSIX_GlobalVars and its PriLimits/PriorityMax/PriorityMin, and the OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY macro) to determine if any pointer types are involved or if const-qualification is missing on referenced pointer objects."
