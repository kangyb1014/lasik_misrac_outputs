  "explanation": "- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: The function uses this identifier in a controlling expression (InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY) and in arithmetic. Need its definition/value to determine whether the comparison is against a compile-time constant and whether that makes the controlling expression invariant (e.g., if it equals 0 or 1).\\n- osal_priority_t: The parameter type of InputPri. Its typedef (signed/unsigned, width, possible range or enum values) is required to know the domain of values that the controlling expressions may actually evaluate to and whether comparisons can be invariant.\\n- OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl: A direct caller of OS_PriorityRemap. Need its prototype/implementation to see what value it passes for InputPri (constant, derived, or variable) when it invokes OS_PriorityRemap; this affects whether the if/else-if tests are invariant in actual usage.\\n- OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl: Another direct caller. Its prototype/implementation shows how the priority argument is obtained/passed (constant, from user input, or from an object) which is necessary to determine if the controlling expressions can be invariant at call sites.\\n- OS_TaskCreate_Impl, OS_ConsoleCreate_Impl, OS_TimeBaseCreate_Impl: These call OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl. Including these callers lets the analyzer trace further back to see what concrete priority values or constants propagate into OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl and ultimately into OS_PriorityRemap (important to decide if the conditionals are effectively invariant across real call paths).\\n- OS_TaskSetPriority: The public wrapper (caller of OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl). Its signature/behavior may constrain the priority values passed to the implementation and thus affect whether the controlling expressions in OS_PriorityRemap are ever variable.\\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global struct instance referenced in the function. Needed to determine whether PriLimits members are compile-time constants, run-time variables, or fixed at initialization (not directly a controlling expression here but relevant to overall behavior and to rule exceptions if some expressions are effectively constant).\\n- PriLimits.PriorityMax and PriLimits.PriorityMin: The exact definitions/values (and whether they are constant after init) are required to understand ranges used in arithmetic and to check whether any implied comparisons could be invariant or reduce the conditional branches to constants in practice.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule concerns invariant controlling expressions. The most critical symbols for that determination are OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY, osal_priority_t, and the caller sites that supply InputPri (to see if they always pass constants). The POSIX_GlobalVars/PriLimits entries are included because their constancy can affect whether branch behavior is effectively invariant in the deployed code."
