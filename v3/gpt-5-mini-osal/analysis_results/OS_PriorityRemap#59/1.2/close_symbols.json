  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_PriorityRemap uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of the types and macros it uses (these could themselves use extensions). Specifically:\n\n- osal_priority_t: This typedef/enum may be defined with compiler-specific extensions (e.g. extended integer types, __attribute__, __extension__ or non-standard underlying type). You need its declaration to check for such extensions.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: This macro might be defined using compiler extensions (complex macros, statement expressions, or builtins). Its value and definition are required to see if any extension is used and to confirm the arithmetic/logic is standard.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global object might be declared with attributes or in a special section (e.g. __attribute__((section(...))), volatile/atomic extensions, or via macros). Its declaration is needed to detect any use of language/compiler extensions.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits: The type of the PriLimits member (its struct/union type) must be examined to ensure it does not use extensions (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, anonymous structs/unions if considered an extension in some compilers, attribute annotations, etc.).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax and PriorityMin: The member declarations (types and any annotations) must be checked because they could be declared with extension-related attributes or non-standard types that would make use of language extensions in the function.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions (the header(s) that define them and the exact macro definitions) is sufficient to verify whether any language extensions are present in the code used by OS_PriorityRemap."
