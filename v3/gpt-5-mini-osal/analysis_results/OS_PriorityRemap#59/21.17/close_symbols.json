  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_PriorityRemap could violate the MISRA rule about bounds on <string.h> functions you must confirm that the remap function itself (or any macros it uses) do not invoke any string.h routine or produce values that would later be used as sizes/indices for string operations. The listed symbols are needed for that analysis: \n\n- osal_priority_t: the underlying integral type, width and signedness are needed to check for integer conversions/overflows in the arithmetic. Hidden signed/unsigned behavior could create negative or very large values that, if later used with string functions, could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: the macro/constant value determines branches and arithmetic (e.g. (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 1), / (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 2)). Its exact value is required to check for division-by-zero, range of OutputPri, and whether any intermediate arithmetic could overflow.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: the global variable must be inspected to ensure it is not a macro that expands to code calling string functions and to locate its type/definition.\n\n- struct/type of POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits (and members PriorityMax, PriorityMin and their types): the numeric ranges and types of PriorityMax/PriorityMin are required to determine the result range of OutputPri and to ensure no implicit promotions/casts produce out-of-range results. If these members were defined via expressions or macros that invoked string.h functions, that would also be relevant.\n\n- OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl and OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl (callers): include the callers to see how InputPri is produced and whether any caller performs string operations or passes pointers derived from this function's result into string APIs. Inspecting callers confirms there is no indirect usage of string.h routines tied to values produced here.\n\nNo string.h functions are present directly in OS_PriorityRemap; the above symbols let an analyst confirm there are no hidden macro expansions or caller-side usages that would create a string.h bounds violation originating from this function."
