  "explanation": "The provided function contains only integer arithmetic and comparisons on priority values and uses no C standard library calls. There are no occurrences of memcmp (or other string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp), no char* or array-of-char variables, and no handling of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the project, it is not present in the supplied code and would need to be reviewed separately.)"
