  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The parameter InputPri (typedef uint8_t) is only read: it is compared (==, >=), and cast to int for arithmetic ((int)InputPri). There are no assignments to InputPri, no increment/decrement operations, no address-of (&) or pointer indirection involving InputPri, and it is not passed by reference. The function uses only local variable OutputPri and global POSIX_GlobalVars; modifying globals is unrelated to Rule 17.8, which concerns modifying function parameters. Therefore no code in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
