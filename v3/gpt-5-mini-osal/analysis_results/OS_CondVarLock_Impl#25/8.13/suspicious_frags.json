  "explanation": "The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and the helper 'static inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)' are already const-qualified and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13. The call to pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut) requires a modifiable mutex object (non-const), so the mutex member and any pointer to it must be non-const by design. The selected fragments cover places where non-const pointers are introduced or obtained (the local pointer variable, the macro that computes a pointer into the object table, the object table definition, and the record type); these should be inspected to determine whether any of those pointers could or should instead point to const-qualified types. Other code in the snippet does not present additional pointer declarations or uses that would be candidates for const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
