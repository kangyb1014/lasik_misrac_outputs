  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies the parameter token itself. The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, and there are no assignments to token or pointer arithmetic involving token. The only use of the parameter is as *token in the call impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token); \u2014 dereferencing the pointer to access the object is allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified; only the pointer shall not be modified). The call to pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut) operates on impl, a local pointer obtained from the table lookup, and does not alter token. The subsequent status checks and return statements do not modify the parameter either. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
