  "explanation": "I examined all controlling constructs in the presented function and related snippets. The only conditional is `if (status != 0)`, where `status` is assigned from `pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut)` immediately before \u2014 this is not an invariant controlling expression. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or constant controlling expressions in the function body. The macro expansion for OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET becomes an array index using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token)) which reduces to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token); that index expression is not a controlling expression and depends on the runtime token value. The inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken reads `token->obj_idx` (a runtime value) and is not a constant controlling expression. No do-while with an integer constant expression or intentionally infinite loop patterns are present. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
