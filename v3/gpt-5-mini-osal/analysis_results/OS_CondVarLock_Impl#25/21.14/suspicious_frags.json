  "explanation": "I examined the entire provided function. There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp or any other C standard-library string comparison functions. The code only uses pthread_mutex_lock, an OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to index the implementation table, and simple pointer/assignment and return operations. None of these operations perform or imply comparison of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro that expands outside this snippet, its expansion would need separate review, but the shown code contains no memcmp usage.)"
