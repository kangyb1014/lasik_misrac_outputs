  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. OS_CondVarLock_Impl only performs two operations: (1) retrieves a table entry via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro (which expands to an index lookup using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))); and (2) calls pthread_mutex_lock. The inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken merely returns token->obj_idx and contains no calls. The only other related function shown, OS_CondVarLock, calls OS_CondVarLock_Impl (one-way) and there are no function pointers or callbacks in the provided code that could produce an indirect call back into OS_CondVarLock_Impl or OS_CondVarLock. pthread_mutex_lock is an external POSIX routine and does not call into these application functions. Therefore there is no direct or indirect self-call in the provided fragments and nothing requiring further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
