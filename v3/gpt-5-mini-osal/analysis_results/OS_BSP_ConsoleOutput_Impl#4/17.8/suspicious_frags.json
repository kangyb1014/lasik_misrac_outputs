  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters. The function prototype and the use of the parameters as inputs (for example passing them to write()) only read the parameters, which is permitted. The local variable declaration (ssize_t WriteLen;) and the subsequent assignment from the write() result operate on a local object, not on parameters. The conditional check (if (WriteLen <= 0)) and the break statement do not modify any parameter. Also, modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter would be allowed by the rule, but this code does not perform such an operation. Therefore only fragments that change the parameter variables themselves warrant further investigation."
