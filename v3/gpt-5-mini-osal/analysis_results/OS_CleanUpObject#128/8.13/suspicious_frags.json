  "explanation": "The above fragments are the only places in the function that declare, convert, or dereference pointer types and therefore are relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). The rest of the function consists of a switch on a non-pointer type (osal_id_t) and calls to various delete/close APIs that take object_id (an integer typedef) \u2014 these do not declare or manipulate pointer types and thus are not relevant to checking const-qualification of pointers. The provided typedefs (uint32, osal_id_t) are integer types, so they do not introduce additional pointer-related concerns."
