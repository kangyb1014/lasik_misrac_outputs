  "explanation": "I did not find any explicit compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/other-compiler-specific keywords or builtins such as __attribute__, __asm, __volatile__ (as an extension), __builtin_*, __typeof__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), or other recognized compiler extensions.\n- The static union initializer = {0} is standard C (it initializes the first member) and returning &ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE as a void pointer uses the standard implicit conversion from object pointer to void*.\n- All storage-class specifiers, type specifiers and syntax used (const, static, union, for-loop, if/else, pointer assignments, function calls) conform to standard C syntax.\n- The use of identifier uint32 appears to be a typedef/alias (not a language extension). Whether that typedef follows project/type-standard rules is outside Rule 1.2 (it is not a compiler language extension by itself).\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for potential use of compiler language extensions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
