  "explanation": "No executed operations in UT_Hook_GetArgPtr appear to be removable without affecting program behaviour, so there are no clear instances of dead code to investigate for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. Reasoning: \n\n- All local variables are used: 'i' is used to iterate, 'Result' holds the return value, and 'MetaPtr' is assigned/used inside the loop. Removing any of these assignments/uses would change behaviour.\n- The loop (for i = 0; i < ContextPtr->ArgCount; ++i) is the principal search mechanism; it is executed under runtime conditions (ArgCount) and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- The Name NULL check and strcmp are necessary to avoid undefined behaviour and to perform the name match; removing them would change behaviour or create faults.\n- The Size check (MetaPtr->Size == 0 || MetaPtr->Size == ExpectedTypeSize) and the Type branches (DIRECT vs INDIRECT) select the correct pointer to return; these branches are functional and not redundant.\n- The break after finding a match terminates the search early; removing it would change behaviour/performance.\n- The fallback error reporting (UtAssert_Failed) and abort (UtAssert_Abort) are executed only on mismatch and are required to signal an error condition; they cannot be removed without changing error handling behaviour. The subsequent assignment of Result = &ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE when the expected type fits is a functional fallback used by callers; removing it would change behaviour. If ExpectedTypeSize is too large, the code deliberately aborts instead of returning NULL \u2014 again, a behavioural choice.\n- The static union ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE is used as the storage target for the fallback pointer; its initialization and existence are functional (providing a valid address and zeroed storage). Although some union members are not directly referenced by name in the function, the union provides appropriately typed storage for various possible requested pointer interpretations; removing the union or its initialization would change behaviour.\n\nGiven these points, no statements inside this function constitute dead code as defined (executed but removable without effect). If inspection is to be extended beyond this function (for example, to other unused data or functions elsewhere in the project), that would require a broader, project-level analysis which is beyond the provided function body and related symbols."
