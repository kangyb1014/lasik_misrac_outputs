  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any of the function parameters, so nothing needs to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning:\n\n- Parameters are: ContextPtr (const UT_StubContext_t *), Name (const char *), ExpectedTypeSize (size_t).\n- There are no assignments to any parameter (no statements like ContextPtr = ..., Name = ..., or ExpectedTypeSize = ...). The loop and logic only read from ContextPtr and Name and compare ExpectedTypeSize; reading or comparing a parameter does not violate the rule.\n- Taking the address of a member (e.g., &ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i]) or using ContextPtr->Meta[i] is a read of the pointed-to object; it does not modify the pointer parameter itself. (The rule allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but in any case this code only reads those objects.)\n- The static ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE is assigned to Result by taking its address; that does not modify any parameter.\n- The assertion and abort calls use the parameters for diagnostics but do not alter them.\n\nTherefore there are no suspicious fragments with respect to Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
