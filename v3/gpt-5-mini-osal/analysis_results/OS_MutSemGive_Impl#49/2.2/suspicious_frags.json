  "explanation": "No code fragments that are executed appear to be dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Reasoning for not flagging other fragments:\n\n- The mutex unlock operation (pthread_mutex_unlock(&(impl->id))) is an observable side-effect that affects program behaviour (synchronization); removing it would change behaviour, so it is not dead.\n- The lookup impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_mutex_table, *token) yields the mutex object used to perform the unlock; removing this would break the unlock call, so it is not dead.\n- The status variable and its check (if (status != 0) { return OS_SEM_FAILURE; }) affect the function return value and thus observable behaviour; not dead.\n- The caller path that obtains the token (OS_ObjectIdGetById), logs a warning (OS_DEBUG), clears last_owner (mutex->last_owner = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED), and calls OS_MutSemGive_Impl are all observable: the logging call may affect timing and diagnostics (per MISRA note 1 timing can matter), the last_owner assignment changes program state, and the call into the implementation performs the unlock. None of these can be removed without changing behaviour.\n- The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro are used to index the object table; they are required for obtaining the correct mutex record and are not dead.\n\nGiven the presented code and definitions, there are no executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; therefore no suspicious dead-code fragments are reported."
