  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C memcmp rule analysis:\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t\n  Needed to understand the layout of the wrapper (which fields exist and their types). In particular, to know the exact types of timer_callback_func and opaque_arg so you can trace how arguments are passed to callbacks and whether any string pointers are stored in or derived from opaque_arg.\n\n- OS_SimpleCallback_t\n  The typedef that defines the function-pointer signature for timer callbacks. Knowing the parameter types (e.g. whether the callback takes char*/const char* or other pointer types) is required to determine whether any callback could receive or compare null-terminated strings and therefore might call memcmp incorrectly.\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t.timer_callback_func\n  The actual function-pointer member invoked by OS_Timer_NoArgCallback. You must inspect what functions may be assigned to this member and their implementations to see if they call memcmp on null-terminated strings. The target function itself only invokes this pointer; any violation would be in the pointed-to functions reachable via this member.\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t.opaque_arg\n  This field is assigned from the void *arg parameter. To determine whether string pointers (null-terminated strings) are being passed via opaque_arg to callbacks (and then compared with memcmp), you must know how opaque_arg is used and cast by callbacks.\n\n- osal_id_t\n  The type of the objid parameter passed to the callback. Knowing its exact type/signature is necessary to resolve which callback implementations can legally be called and whether any implementations accept additional pointer arguments (strings) indirectly.\n\n- All functions that create/register/init OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t instances (places that assign timer_callback_func)\n  To find actual functions that can be invoked by OS_Timer_NoArgCallback you must locate the code that sets timer_callback_func (timer creation/registration). Those symbols/locations show which callbacks are possible targets and must be inspected for memcmp usage.\n\n- All functions that can be stored in OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t.timer_callback_func (registered callback implementations)\n  The MISRA memcmp rule applies to code that compares null-terminated strings. Since OS_Timer_NoArgCallback dispatches to callbacks via a function pointer, you must examine each potential callback implementation reachable from that pointer to see whether any use memcmp to compare C-strings.\n\n- All wrapper/trampoline timer-callback functions (other variants like arg-accepting or arg-wrapping callbacks)\n  There may be other helper wrappers which adapt argument-less callbacks or pass opaque_arg to real callbacks. These wrappers may perform casts or calls that convert opaque_arg into string pointers or call memcmp; they must be inspected.\n\n- memcmp (standard library symbol) and all call sites in the codebase that invoke memcmp\n  To determine whether the codebase (and specifically any callbacks reachable from timer_callback_func) violates the MISRA rule you need to find every use of memcmp and inspect the operands to see if it is being used to compare null-terminated strings. List and inspect all memcmp call sites reachable from the timer callback registration / invocation paths.\n\nNotes on scope: OS_Timer_NoArgCallback itself does not call memcmp. The only way it could be relevant to the memcmp MISRA rule is via callbacks it invokes (directly or via wrappers) or via uses of opaque_arg that become string pointers. The symbols above let the next analyst (or tool) resolve which callback functions are possible targets and then inspect those implementations and any memcmp call sites for violations."
