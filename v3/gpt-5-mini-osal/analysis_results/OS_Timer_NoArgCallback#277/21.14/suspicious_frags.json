  "explanation": "The target function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback and the related definitions contain no use of the C standard library function memcmp, nor any other string-comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, etc.). The code only manipulates a union containing a function pointer and a void* and invokes that function pointer; there are no char* or null-terminated string operations present. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp-based string comparisons exist, they would be located outside the supplied code and would need to be identified in those other files for review."
