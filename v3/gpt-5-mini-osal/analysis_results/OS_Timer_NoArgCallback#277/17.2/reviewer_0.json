This is an indirect self-call and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback:\ntypedef union\n{\n    OS_TimerCallback_t timer_callback_func;\n    void *             opaque_arg;\n} OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t\n...\nOS_common_record_t *base\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s scenario describes a possible runtime path (if someone stores a pointer to OS_Timer_NoArgCallback into the void *arg, the function pointer extracted from the union would be OS_Timer_NoArgCallback and the call would recurse). However, MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.2 prohibits actual self-calls (direct or indirect) in the program; it does not automatically condemn every indirect call site as a violation. Whether a violation exists depends on whether, in the complete program, there is a reachable call path that causes OS_Timer_NoArgCallback to be invoked through that function-pointer argument. The single function as shown does an indirect call via a function pointer; that is not by itself a guaranteed violation of 17.2. A conservative static analyser might flag a potential (possible) recursion because the target is not statically known, but you cannot conclude a definite MISRA 17.2 breach from this snippet alone. To be compliant you must ensure (by design/review or static analysis of the whole program) that the arg passed here can never contain a pointer to OS_Timer_NoArgCallback (or otherwise prevent such recursion)."
