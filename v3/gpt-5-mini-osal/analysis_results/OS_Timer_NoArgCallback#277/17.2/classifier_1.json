  "scenario": "The typedef union itself does not perform any function calls, so it does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Rule 17.2 forbids functions calling themselves (directly or indirectly); a union declaration cannot cause that. However, a violation could occur at call sites: if the function pointer stored in OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t resolved to OS_Timer_NoArgCallback and that pointer were invoked (e.g. Conv.timer_callback_func = OS_Timer_NoArgCallback; (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid);), that would be an indirect call to the same function and would violate Rule 17.2."
