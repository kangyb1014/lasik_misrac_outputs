  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment Conv.opaque_arg = arg; is executed and the next statement dereferences Conv.timer_callback_func, so the code is reachable. There is no unreachable code introduced by this fragment. (Note: this may still be undefined/unsafe if Conv.timer_callback_func is uninitialized or NULL, but that is not an unreachable-code issue.)"
