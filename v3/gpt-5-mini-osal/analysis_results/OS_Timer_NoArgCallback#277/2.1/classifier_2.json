  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment as shown (a static function signature) by itself does not create unreachable code. However, a specific violation would occur if this static function is never referenced/called in the entire project (for example, all call sites are removed or conditionally compiled out via #if/#endif), making the function body effectively dead/unreachable. In that case OS_Timer_NoArgCallback would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
