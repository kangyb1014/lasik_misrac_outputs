  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code analysis:\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t: The target function constructs a local Conv of this type and accesses its members. You must see the struct definition to know the exact member types, whether timer_callback_func is optional/nullable, and whether opaque_arg/other members are used elsewhere \u2014 this affects whether the call is an observable operation.\n\n- OS_SimpleCallback_t (or the actual typedef used for the member): The comment references this typedef; the concrete typedef reveals the intended function-signature/semantics of the callback. Knowing the signature helps determine whether the call produces observable effects (side-effects, I/O, state changes) and whether the call is well-formed or undefined behavior.\n\n- timer_callback_func (the function-pointer member/type): You need the precise function-pointer type (e.g. void (*)(osal_id_t)) to check whether the invocation is valid, whether conversions from void* are UB/implementation-defined, and to enumerate possible targets. Also needed to check whether the pointer can legally be NULL and whether the code should guard against that.\n\n- osal_id_t: The callback is invoked with an osal_id_t argument. Its definition is required to understand whether passing the value is observable (e.g. if it encodes resources, indices, or special sentinel values) and to inspect any conversion or truncation issues that could make the call a no-op.\n\n- All functions/places that initialize or assign OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t.timer_callback_func (timer-creation/registration APIs): To decide if the operation (the callback call) is dead, you must know whether timer_callback_func is ever set to a non-functional value or is never set at all. The initialization/assignment sites show whether the callback pointer is actually provided and under what conditions \u2014 if it is never assigned or always assigned to a trivial/no-op function, the call may be dead.\n\n- All call sites that register or invoke OS_Timer_NoArgCallback (timer registration/dispatch code): OS_Timer_NoArgCallback is static; you must establish whether it is ever executed. Every registration point or dispatch path that can cause this function to be invoked (timer scheduler, ISR registration, dispatch tables) is needed to determine reachability and whether the invocation is actually triggered at runtime. Although unreachable code is not 'dead' per MISRA notes, determining if the operation (the indirect call) is executed requires these sites.\n\n- Definitions/bodies (and prototypes) of every function that may be stored in timer_callback_func: MISRA's dead-code rule depends on whether removing an operation changes observable behaviour. The operation here is a call to the function pointer; you must inspect all candidate target functions to see if they have observable side-effects. If every possible target is a no-op or their removal has no effect, the call could be dead. Conversely, if any target has side-effects, the call is not dead.\n\n- Any code that can set timer_callback_func to NULL or otherwise disable the callback (initializers, conditional assignments, config macros): If the pointer can be nulled or disabled by configuration, the call could be a no-op in some builds or configurations. You must find such code or configuration symbols to determine whether the call is effectively dead in any supported configuration.\n\nNotes: The above list focuses on symbols that determine (1) whether OS_Timer_NoArgCallback is ever invoked and (2) whether the indirect call it performs has observable effects. Both are required to decide if the operation constitutes dead code under MISRA (i.e., executed but removable without changing behaviour)."
