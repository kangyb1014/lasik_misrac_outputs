  "explanation": "Other lines in the snippet do not introduce pointer declarations or perform pointer-to-pointer assignments that would be subject to Rule 8.13, so they do not need investigation in this context. Specifically:\n- The local declaration \"OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t Conv;\" is an object declaration, not a pointer declaration.\n- The call \"(*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid);\" invokes a function pointer but does not pass or assign any pointer-to-object that could be const-qualified within this snippet.\n- The comment block contains explanatory text only.\nNote: the definition of OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t is not present in this snippet; if that type contains pointer members, those definitions should be inspected separately, but they are not part of the provided code fragment and therefore are not included here."
