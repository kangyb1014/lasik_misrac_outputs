  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must determine whether memcmp is used directly in this function or is pulled in indirectly via macros/definitions referenced by this function. Explanations:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: The global variable referenced in the expression could be a macro or an accessor that expands to code; inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand/forward to a function that uses memcmp.\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: The member access might be implemented via macros or inline accessors; examine the member definition (and any accessor macros) to confirm no hidden calls to memcmp.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: These identifiers may be macros (or inline expressions) \u2014 examine their definitions to ensure they do not expand to code that invokes memcmp.\n- INT_MAX: Although ordinarily a constant, check its definition inclusion to ensure no unexpected macro side-effects in this translation unit.\n- uint32, uint64, int32: The typedefs or macros that supply these types should be checked to ensure they are plain typedefs/macros and do not hide function-like behavior that could call memcmp (rare but necessary for a sound static check).\n- memcmp: The symbol itself must be present/checked so the analyzer can detect any direct calls from this function or from macros expanded here.\n- <string.h> (or the translation unit that declares/defines memcmp): Include/headers and local replacements/overrides need inspection to detect any local implementation or macro that compares strings using memcmp.\n- any macros used to define OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR/OS_SharedGlobalVars: A generic entry to ensure all related macro definitions in headers are examined for hidden use of memcmp.\n\nTogether these symbols let a follow-up analyzer determine whether OS_Milli2Ticks contains, or expands to, any use of memcmp (directly or indirectly) that could be used to compare null-terminated strings, which would violate the MISRA rule."
