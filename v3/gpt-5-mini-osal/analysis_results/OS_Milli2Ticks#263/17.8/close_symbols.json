  "explanation": "To determine whether the function parameters are being modified (per the MISRA rule), the analyzer must be able to rule out any hidden side-effects or atypical definitions coming from externally defined symbols and must know the exact types involved.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: The global used in the computation could be a macro or an object with accessor semantics (or overloaded via macros) that might have side effects; its declaration/definition is needed to ensure that reading its member cannot modify the function parameters.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: The member's type (and whether it is a macro, function-like macro, or volatile) must be known to ensure the expression that computes num_of_ticks has no side-effect that could modify the parameter 'ticks' or 'milli_seconds'.\n\n- INT_MAX: The comparison against INT_MAX affects whether *ticks is assigned; INT_MAX's definition (and relation to 'int' width) is needed to reason about the branch behavior, but also to ensure INT_MAX is not a macro that expands to code with side-effects.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: These return-code symbols must be inspected to confirm they are simple constants (enum or macro) and not macros that expand to expressions with side-effects that might modify parameters.\n\n- uint64, uint32, int32: The typedefs/definitions are required to understand the sizes/representations used in the casts and intermediate arithmetic so you can determine whether any unusual type semantics or operator-overloads (via macros/typedefs) could lead to modification of a parameter.\n\n- int: The definition/width of 'int' is needed to interpret the cast to (int) and the INT_MAX check, to ensure the assignment to *ticks is indeed a modification of the pointed-to object (which is allowed) and not some disguised modification of the pointer itself.\n\nWith these symbols known, you can verify: (1) there are no macro expansions or side-effecting definitions that rebind or assign to the parameter 'ticks' itself, and (2) all assignments in the function are to *ticks (the pointed object) and to local variables, not to the pointer parameter variable."
