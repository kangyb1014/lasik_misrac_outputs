  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for Rule 17.2 were identified. The function body contains only arithmetic, casts, assignments, and a conditional; there are no direct function calls, no calls via function pointers, and no function-like macros being invoked. The usage OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond is a direct structure/member access (not a function call), and INT_MAX, OS_SUCCESS, and OS_ERROR are symbolic constants/macros, not function invocations. Therefore there is no code here that could cause the function to call itself either directly or indirectly."
