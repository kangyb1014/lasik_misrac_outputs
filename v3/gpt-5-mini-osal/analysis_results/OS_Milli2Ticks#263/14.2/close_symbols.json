The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "uint32/uint64/int32: The MISRA for\u2011loop rule reasons about loop counters and their types (signed/unsigned, width). Knowing these typedefs is required when assessing whether a loop counter/modified object uses an appropriate integer type or could overflow or be otherwise misused.\n\nOS_SharedGlobalVars and member TicksPerSecond (type): The rule forbids use of objects in the for condition that are modified in the loop body. If this global or its member were used as a loop counter or in a loop condition (in this function or in any called function), you must know its declaration/type and whether it is modifiable or has side effects.\n\nINT_MAX: Used by the function to compare numeric ranges. While not directly a loop symbol, its value and type matter when reasoning about integer ranges, casts and potential interactions if a loop counter used the same limits.\n\nOS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR: Result macros/enumerators are part of the function flow. They do not create loops, but including them lets an analyzer understand return paths and whether control\u2011flow (and thus any loops in called code) is reachable.\n\nticks (int * parameter): The pointer target is an object that could be modified. The MISRA rule prohibits loop counters being modified in the loop body; if *ticks were used as a loop counter elsewhere (or passed into a called function that implements a for loop), its declaration/type and aliasing properties must be known.\n\nNote: This function contains no for statement and calls no other functions. Therefore, to establish whether this function itself violates the MISRA for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness rule, no additional symbols are strictly required. The listed symbols are provided because an analysis that considers called functions or shared/global objects (which could contain/affect for loops) will need their declarations and types to fully assess compliance."
