True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe fragment passes &token (type OS_object_token_t *) to OS_DirRewind_Impl. If the prototype of OS_DirRewind_Impl is non-const, e.g. int32 OS_DirRewind_Impl(OS_object_token_t *token), and the function does not modify the pointed-to object, then a pointer to a non-const type is used when a const-qualified pointer could be used \u2014 this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. To fix, declare the parameter as const OS_object_token_t *token (and update the implementation accordingly). If, however, OS_DirRewind_Impl legitimately modifies *token (i.e. its API requires a mutable pointer), then no violation occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not determinable from the fragment alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 that is a requirement on the function's parameter declaration/definition, not on this call site by itself. If OS_DirRewind_Impl is declared/defined as taking a mutable pointer (OS_object_token_t *token) but does not actually modify *token, then that declaration violates Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const OS_object_token_t *token (and the prototype/definition updated accordingly). If, however, OS_DirRewind_Impl legitimately modifies the token (or its API requires a mutable pointer), then there is no Rule 8.13 violation. Because the prototype/implementation of OS_DirRewind_Impl is not provided, you cannot conclude a violation from the shown call. Recommendation: inspect the OS_DirRewind_Impl prototype/implementation \u2014 if it does not modify the object, change its parameter to const and update all prototypes/definitions; otherwise no change is needed."
