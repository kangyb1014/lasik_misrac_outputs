  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointers to non-const-qualified types. In this function the only uses of pointer values are the two occasions where the address of the local variable 'token' is taken and passed to other functions. Other lines (function signature, local variable declaration, assignments, and return statement) do not take or pass pointers to non-const data and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation for this rule."
