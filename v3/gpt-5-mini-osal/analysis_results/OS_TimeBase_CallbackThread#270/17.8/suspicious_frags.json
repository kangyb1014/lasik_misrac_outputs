  "explanation": "The only function parameter is \"osal_id_t timebase_id\". A complete scan of the function shows no assignments to timebase_id, no increments/decrements of it, and it is never passed by address. All uses of timebase_id are reads/arguments (examples: OS_TaskRegister_Impl(timebase_id); (*syncfunc)(timebase_id); OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., timebase_id, &token); OS_ObjectIdEqual(timebase_id, record->active_id)). No other parameters exist on this function that could be modified. Local pointer variables (e.g., &token, &cb_token) are passed to helper routines, but these are local objects and not function parameters of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread; modifying the objects they point to is allowed per the rule. The callback invocation passes an ID value (OS_ObjectIdFromToken(&cb_token)), not the function parameter, so it does not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
