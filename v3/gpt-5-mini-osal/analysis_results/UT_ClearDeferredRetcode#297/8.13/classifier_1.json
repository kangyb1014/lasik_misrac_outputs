  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: StubPtr is used as a mutable pointer (it is assigned from UT_GetStubEntry and then passed to UT_ClearStubEntry, which by name and usage is expected to modify the pointed object), so it must not be const-qualified. If the code did not need to modify the pointed-to object, then it should be declared as const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr to comply with Rule 8.13."
