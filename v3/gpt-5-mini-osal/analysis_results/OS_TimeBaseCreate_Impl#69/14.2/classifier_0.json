  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TimeBaseCreate_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TimeBaseCreate_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32                               return_code;\n    int                                 status;\n    int                                 i;\n    osal_index_t                        idx;\n    struct sigevent                     evp;\n    struct timespec                     ts;\n    OS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t *local;\n    OS_timebase_internal_record_t *     timebase;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t            arg;\n\n    local    = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_timebase_table, *token);\n    timebase = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_timebase_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     * Spawn a dedicated time base handler thread\n     *\n     * This alleviates the need to handle expiration in the context of a signal handler -\n     * The handler thread can call a BSP synchronized delay implementation as well as the\n     * application callback function.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop uses a single loop counter (idx) initialized in the first clause, the second clause (idx < OS_MAX_TIMEBASES) has no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter and a constant, and the third clause (++idx) modifies only the loop counter. The loop body does not modify idx, and no objects modified in the body are referenced in the loop header, so Rule 14.2 is satisfied."
