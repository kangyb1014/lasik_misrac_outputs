  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl:\n```c\nstatic int32 OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl(int *os_maxfd, fd_set *os_set, const OS_FdSet *OSAL_set)\n{\n    size_t       offset;\n    size_t       bit;\n    osal_index_t id;\n    uint8        objids;\n    int          osfd;\n    int32        status;\n\n    status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    for (offset = 0; offset < sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids); ++offset)\n    {\n        objids = OSAL_set->object_ids[offset];\n        bit    = 0;\n        while (objids != 0)\n        {\n            id = OSAL_INDEX_C((offset * 8) + bit);\n            if ((objids & 0x01) != 0 && id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES)\n            {\n                osfd = OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd;\n                if (osfd >= 0)\n                {\n                    if (osfd >= FD_SETSIZE || !OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].selectable)\n                    {\n                        /* out of range of select() implementation */\n                        status = OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED;\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        FD_SET(osfd, os_set);\n                        if (osfd > *os_maxfd)\n                        {\n                            *os_maxfd = osfd;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            ++bit;\n            objids >>= 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl:\nsize_t      length = strlen(string)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (osfd >= 0)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The test if (osfd >= 0) is guarding use of a runtime value (osfd = OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd) that can legitimately be negative for unused/invalid handles. There is no evidence that osfd is constant, so the branch is executable and its removal would change program behaviour (e.g. attempting to use invalid file descriptors). (A violation would occur only if it were provable that osfd is always >= 0 or always < 0, making the conditional and its body dead code.)"
