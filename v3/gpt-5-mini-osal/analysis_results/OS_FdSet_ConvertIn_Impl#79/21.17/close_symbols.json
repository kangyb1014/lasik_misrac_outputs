  "explanation": "For a correct analysis of potential out-of-bounds memory accesses (and to verify that no string.h functions are indirectly invoked in ways that could violate the rule), the next agent must see the following symbols:\n\n- OS_FdSet / OSAL_set->object_ids: The function iterates using sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) and indexes object_ids. You must know the exact type and compile-time length of object_ids to determine whether the offset loop can read out-of-bounds.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: This macro (or function) maps (offset*8 + bit) into an osal_index_t id. Its definition is required to verify that the computed id is what the code expects and that the id bound check (id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) correctly prevents out-of-range indexing.\n\n- osal_index_t: The width and signedness of this type affect comparisons and indexing semantics; you must ensure no integer conversion/overflow can make the id test ineffective and cause an out-of-range access.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The code uses this constant in the bounds check for indexing OS_impl_filehandle_table. Its value is needed to verify the adequacy of the check and whether it matches the actual table size.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (array) and its length / element type: The code indexes this table with id. To confirm there is no out-of-bounds access you must know the declared number of elements and the structure used for elements.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd and .selectable fields: The code reads .fd and .selectable and uses them in further checks (>=0, >=FD_SETSIZE, selectable). You need their types and semantics to ensure the checks correctly prevent invalid accesses and to see if reading these fields could itself read past the table.\n\n- fd_set type: FD_SET operates on the fd_set object. You must know the internal representation (array of longs/ints/bytes, size) to determine whether FD_SET(osfd, os_set) can write beyond the bounds of the object pointed to by os_set.\n\n- FD_SET macro implementation: FD_SET may be a macro that manipulates bits inside fd_set; its exact implementation is required to ensure it does not call any string.h functions (memcpy/memset/etc.) or perform accesses beyond the fd_set object for the provided osfd value.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE: The code compares osfd >= FD_SETSIZE to guard FD_SET. You must verify that FD_SETSIZE matches the capacity of fd_set and that the check is sufficient to prevent FD_SET from writing out-of-bounds.\n\n- uint8 typedef: The type of objids affects bit operations and shifting; knowing its width confirms the behavior of objids >>= 1 and the loop termination and ensures no undefined behavior that might mask an out-of-bounds access.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyst confirm that all indexing and bit-manipulation operations are properly bounded and that no hidden use of string.h functions (e.g., inside FD_SET or other macros) can cause accesses beyond the referenced objects."
