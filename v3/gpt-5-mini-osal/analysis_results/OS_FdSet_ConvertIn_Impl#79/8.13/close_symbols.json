  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters in OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl should be const-qualified (MISRA: pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible), the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- fd_set (typedef/definition): The type of the os_set parameter. Knowing the exact type is required to determine whether os_set is modified by operations in the function and whether it could legally be declared const. Without the fd_set definition you cannot reason about member access or semantics of set-manipulation macros.\n\n- FD_SET (macro/function): This is invoked as FD_SET(osfd, os_set) inside the function. You must inspect its definition/signature to confirm that it modifies the fd_set pointed to by os_set (i.e., it takes a non-const pointer or performs writes). If FD_SET modifies os_set, then os_set cannot be const-qualified. If FD_SET were a non-modifying accessor (unlikely), os_set might be eligible to be const.\n\n- OS_FdSet (typedef/struct): The function takes a const OS_FdSet *OSAL_set and indexes OSAL_set->object_ids and uses sizeof on that member. To confirm that OSAL_set is correctly const-qualified (i.e., no writes to the pointed-to data occur) you must see the struct layout and type of object_ids to ensure the code only reads from it. This also clarifies whether accesses are by value or via any pointer that might be modified.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (declaration and element type): The function reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable. While these accesses are reads, the analyzer should see whether the table is declared const or mutable and whether accessing it involves any pointer dereference that might require const qualification. Knowing the element type (structure fields) also helps determine whether any pointer fields are involved that the function might modify or could be const-qualified.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine the mutability of the pointer parameters used in this function: os_maxfd (clearly written via *os_maxfd, so cannot be const), os_set (requires FD_SET/fd_set inspection to see if it is modified), and OSAL_set (already const in the prototype; verify accesses are only reads by checking OS_FdSet)."
