Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' analysis:\n\n- OS_FdSet (definition, particularly object_ids): The outer for-loop uses sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) as the loop bound. To decide whether the controlling expression is invariant (compile-time constant) or depends on runtime state, the analyzer must know the declared type and compile-time length of object_ids (array vs pointer, element type). This determines whether sizeof(...) is a compile-time constant and how the loop bound behaves.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro or function): The id value used in conditional expressions is produced via OSAL_INDEX_C((offset * 8) + bit). The analyzer must know what this macro/function does (e.g. cast, mapping, bounds checking) to determine whether id changes with offset/bit or could be an invariant expression.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef / range): The type and value range of id affect comparisons such as id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES and array indexing of OS_impl_filehandle_table[id]. The signedness/width also affects whether comparisons are invariant or can change during iteration.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): Used in the controlling conditional (id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES). The analyzer needs this constant to determine if that part of the expression is a compile-time constant or can vary as id varies.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (definition and element type; fields 'fd' and 'selectable'): Several conditions read OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable. To decide whether expressions like osfd >= 0, osfd >= FD_SETSIZE or !selectable are invariant, the analyzer needs the table element type and whether fd/selectable are compile-time constants, modifiable, or volatile. Also needed to understand indexing validity and whether table contents can vary with id.\n\n- uint8 (typedef / width and signedness): The inner while loop tests (objids != 0) and performs objids >>= 1. The width and unsigned semantics determine that right shifts will eventually produce zero (i.e. the loop is not infinite) and whether the controlling expression can be invariant; the analyzer must know the exact type to decide this.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE (macro): Appears in the conditional osfd >= FD_SETSIZE. The analyzer needs its value to reason whether that comparison could be true/false and whether that part of the controlling expression is a fixed compile-time constant.\n\n- FD_SET (macro): Although not itself a controlling expression, FD_SET mutates os_set and is used in the block guarded by the condition. Knowledge of FD_SET is helpful to understand side-effects and whether any control variables could be modified by macros (unlikely, but necessary to rule out hidden invariance/side-effects that affect controlling expressions).\n\n(These symbols provide the type, width, macro expansion and global data layout information required to decide whether the loop and conditional controlling expressions in OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl are invariant or genuinely depend on changing state.)"
