  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already const (const OS_object_token_t *token) so its declaration is correct; OS_ObjectIdFromToken is declared to take a const pointer (static inline osal_id_t OS_ObjectIdFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)) so it is const-correct; OS_ObjectIdToInteger operates on an id value (no pointer qualification issue); the call to pthread_detach uses a pthread_t member (not a pointer) and strerror returns a char* from the C library (its usage here does not involve taking or discarding const qualifiers from user-provided pointers); the debug print and return statements do not introduce pointer const-qualification issues. The listed fragments are the places where non-const pointers or pointers-to-objects returned as non-const could be made const (or may be discarding const), so they should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
