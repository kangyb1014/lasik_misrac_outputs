  "explanation": "OS_Application_Startup has no parameters (neither value nor pointer parameters), so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated inside this function. The only identifier modified is the local variable 'Status', which is not a parameter and is permitted to be assigned. The cast (int)Status is a value conversion in the call to BSP_DEBUG and does not modify any parameter of OS_Application_Startup. Calls to other functions (OS_API_Init, BSP_DEBUG, OS_ApplicationExit) could involve parameters inside their own definitions, but those are outside the scope of this function and are not present in the provided code fragment; therefore they cannot be flagged here under Rule 17.8."
