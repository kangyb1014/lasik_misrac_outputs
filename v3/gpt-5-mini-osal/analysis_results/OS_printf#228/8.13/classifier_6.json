  "scenario": "In the shown code Str is declared as const char * and is passed to OS_Console_CopyOut. There is no evidence in the fragment that a non-const pointer type is used, so the rule is not violated here. (If, however, OS_Console_CopyOut were declared to take a non-const char * parameter, that would be a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should be const-qualified when the function does not modify the pointed-to data.)"
