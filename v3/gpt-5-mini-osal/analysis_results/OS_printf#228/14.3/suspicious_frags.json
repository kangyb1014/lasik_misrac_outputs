  "explanation": "There are no explicit loop constructs (for, while, do-while) in the presented code that could directly violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3, so ordinary if/else conditionals and other expressions in this function are not relevant to the rule. The only places that could hide invariant controlling expressions are macro expansions; therefore the macro invocations listed above should be inspected to see if they expand to loops with invariant controlling expressions (e.g. while(1), do { ... } while(0), etc.). All other statements (if/else conditions, assignments, function calls such as va_start/va_end, vsnprintf, OS_ConsoleWrite, and the comparisons against OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER or OS_BUFFER_SIZE) are not loop controlling expressions and do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
