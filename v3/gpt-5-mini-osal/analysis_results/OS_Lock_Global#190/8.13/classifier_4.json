  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code fragment only reads fields via the existing OS_object_token_t *token parameter and passes them as integer values to OS_DEBUG. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when possible; here token cannot be made const for the function overall because other code in OS_Lock_Global modifies token (e.g. token->lock_key). There are no new pointer variables that should be const in this fragment, and the string literal passed to OS_DEBUG is the usual format argument (compatible with const char *). Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
