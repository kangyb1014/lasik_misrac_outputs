  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The function contains only if/else conditionals (no while/for/do-while loops) and each conditional depends on runtime-varying values:\n\n- Outer if: (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE) \u2014 depends on token fields passed at runtime.\n- if (!OS_ObjectIdIsValid(self_task_id)) \u2014 self_task_id is obtained from OS_TaskGetId_Impl() (thread-specific) so the result can vary at runtime.\n- if (objtype->owner_key.key_value != 0) \u2014 depends on mutable objtype state (owner_key).\n\nConstants/macros referenced (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE, OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED) are used in expressions combined with runtime values; they do not make the controlling expressions invariant. There are no do-while loops with constant controlling expressions and no infinite-loop constructs that would fall under the allowed exceptions. Therefore, there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
