  "explanation": "For deciding whether any operation in OS_Lock_Global is dead (removal would not affect program behaviour) the analysis must know all data, constants, and external behaviours that determine execution paths and observable side effects:\n\n- OS_objtype_state: the global array indexed by token->obj_type. Needed to know liveness of writes to objtype->transaction_count and objtype->owner_key and whether those fields are ever read elsewhere.\n- OS_objtype_state_t: structure layout (fields transaction_count, owner_key, etc.). Required to determine which assignments in OS_Lock_Global affect program state.\n- OS_object_token_t: token layout (obj_type, lock_mode, lock_key). Required to know whether writing token->lock_key is observable and whether token is used elsewhere.\n- osal_id_t: type of self_task_id; needed to reason about value ranges and comparisons affecting control flow and key computation.\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: constant used in the initial condition. Needed to determine whether the if-condition can ever be true for given obj_type values.\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: constant used in the initial condition. Needed to determine whether the if-condition can ever be true for given lock_mode values.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE: constant used in computing token->lock_key.key_value. Needed to assess whether the assignment produces a nonzero/meaningful value and whether it has observable effect.\n- OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED: special id assigned when caller has no valid OS id. Needed to know whether this value can collide with real ids or change subsequent behaviour.\n- type of lock_key/owner_key (structure with .key_value): the concrete type is required to know field widths and whether copying owner_key has side effects or is observable elsewhere.\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl: implementation and possible return set. Needed to determine how often the branch of assigning OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED is taken and whether the key computation varies by caller.\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: predicate semantics; needed to know exact conditions under which self_task_id is considered invalid and triggers reservation.\n- OS_ObjectIdToInteger: mapping semantics from id to integer; required to reason about the computed key_value (value range, uniqueness) and debug output content.\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl: implementation / side effects of the lower-level lock. If locking is a no-op or always fails, the subsequent bookkeeping might be dead; conversely, if it is required to provide mutual exclusion for later code, then the bookkeeping is meaningful.\n- OS_Unlock_Global: paired unlock behaviour. Needed to know whether owner_key and transaction_count manipulated here are subsequently consulted/unwound (i.e., whether the bookkeeping affects unlock operations).\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry: callers/contexts in which OS_Lock_Global is used. Required to determine whether the bookkeeping performed here (transaction_count, owner_key, token->lock_key) is ever relied upon by the call sites; if all callers ignore these fields then the operations could be dead.\n- OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken: other object-id helper functions invoked by callers (seen in call graph). They may read owner_key/transaction_count/token->lock_key; include to find all readers of the state written by OS_Lock_Global.\n- OS_DEBUG: debug output routine. Printing is an observable side effect \u2014 removal could change behaviour (timing/IO). Need to know whether OS_DEBUG has side effects beyond logging (e.g., fault injection or blocking) to decide if those calls are dead.\n\nIn short: to judge whether the condition testing, key/computed-value assignments, transaction_count increment, owner_key check/assignment, and debug prints are dead, the analyzer must see the definitions, types, constants, and all other code that reads or depends on these fields or values (lock/unlock implementations and the transaction/iterator callers)."
