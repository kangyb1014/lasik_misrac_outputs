  "scenario": "No violation: the if-condition depends on runtime values (token->obj_type and token->lock_mode), so the statements inside the block are reachable when the condition is true. There is no code that is provably unreachable (no always-false/always-true compile-time condition, nor code after an unconditional return/goto in the fragment)."
