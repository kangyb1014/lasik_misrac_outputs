  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in this function: there are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar string-handling routines. The code only reads/writes integer and structure fields (e.g. token->lock_key, objtype->owner_key) and performs integer operations; the struct assignment objtype->owner_key = token->lock_key is a whole-object copy, not a string operation. While this function calls other helpers (OS_ObjectIdIsValid, OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_Lock_Global_Impl, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_DEBUG), any use of string.h inside those functions would need to be reviewed in their own definitions \u2014 there are no direct string-handling calls or character-buffer manipulations here to trigger Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
