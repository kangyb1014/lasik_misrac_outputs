  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_PthreadTaskEntry modifies its parameter arg (MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified) we must confirm that the code only copies the pointer value and does not modify the parameter object itself or create an alias allowing modification. The union/typedef OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (and the precise types of its members opaque_arg and id) are required to see whether assigning local_arg.opaque_arg = arg performs a copy of the pointer value or something else (for example if opaque_arg were a pointer-to-pointer). The exact type of id is needed to understand what is passed to OS_TaskEntryPoint (is it an integer value derived from the pointer, or a pointer type that could alias arg). The OS_TaskEntryPoint prototype/implementation is required to ensure that passing local_arg.id does not somehow modify the original parameter (for example by taking the address of a caller object or expecting a pointer-to-pointer), and to see whether any callee could mutate the parameter object via aliasing. Together these symbols let an analyst determine if arg itself is ever assigned to or modified, or only copied and used by callees."
