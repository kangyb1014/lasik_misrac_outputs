  "explanation": "- OS_TaskEntryPoint: This is the direct callee invoked with local_arg.id; you must inspect its implementation to see whether memcmp is used there to compare strings (and how the argument is interpreted).  \n- OS_TaskPrepare: A callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint (per the static graph); it may contain calls to memcmp or further string-comparison logic that would constitute a MISRA violation.  \n- OS_TaskExit: Another callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint that might perform comparisons using memcmp; its code must be checked.  \n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The union/struct definition is required to determine the actual type and meaning of the id member (e.g. char * vs integer). Knowing id\u2019s type and how opaque_arg is aliasing it is essential to determine whether a pointer passed into OS_TaskEntryPoint can be a null-terminated string and thus whether memcmp would be used on such a string.  \n- memcmp: The standard-library function itself (declaration/uses) must be located in the call chain so you can identify any calls to memcmp and inspect their argument types/values to determine whether it is being applied to null-terminated strings (the specific MISRA C prohibition)."
