  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, nested functions, statement-expressions, or pragma extensions).\n- The union OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t and its use (writing opaque_arg and reading id) are standard C constructs; while reading an inactive union member or converting between pointers and integer types may be implementation-defined or hazardous for portability, they are not explicitly compiler extensions as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 reporting criteria.\n- The comment \"/* cppcheck-suppress ... */\" is a static-analysis tool directive, not a compiler extension.\n\nBecause the rule requires reporting only explicit compiler/documented language extensions, there are no fragments to report. If policy also requires flagging implementation-defined or undefined behaviors (e.g. type-punning through a union or pointer\u2194integer conversions), those would be separate MISRA concerns but are not compiler extensions per the rule text."
