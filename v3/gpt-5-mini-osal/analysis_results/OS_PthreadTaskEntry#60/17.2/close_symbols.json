  "explanation": "- OS_TaskEntryPoint: This is the direct callee from OS_PthreadTaskEntry. You must examine its definition/call graph to see whether it calls back to OS_PthreadTaskEntry (direct recursion) or calls other functions that may form a cycle (indirect recursion).\n- OS_TaskPrepare: Listed as a callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint in the static call graph. Its body or call graph must be inspected to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls OS_PthreadTaskEntry or any function that leads back to OS_PthreadTaskEntry.\n- OS_TaskExit: Also listed as a callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint. Its implementation or call graph must be checked for calls that could create a recursive cycle back to OS_PthreadTaskEntry.\n- (all transitive callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint / OS_TaskPrepare / OS_TaskExit): To prove absence (or presence) of indirect recursion you need the complete transitive closure of callees starting from OS_TaskEntryPoint. Any function reachable from OS_TaskEntryPoint could, through a chain of calls, call OS_PthreadTaskEntry and thereby create indirect recursion; therefore their definitions or call relationships are required."
