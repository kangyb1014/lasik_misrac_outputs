  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (definition): The function stores the incoming void *arg into local_arg.opaque_arg and later reads local_arg.id. You must see the exact type and const-qualification of the opaque_arg and id members (and any typedefs they use) to determine whether assigning arg discards or requires a const qualifier (e.g. opaque_arg declared as void * vs const void *, or id as an integer/pointer type). Without the wrapper definition you cannot tell whether the pointer ought to be const or whether a const qualifier is lost.\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint (declaration/definition): OS_PthreadTaskEntry passes local_arg.id to OS_TaskEntryPoint. Its parameter type and const-qualification determine whether the original arg value must be non-const (or is propagated as const). You need the prototype (or implementation) to see if a non-const pointer is required, or if a const pointer could be used.\n- OS_TaskPrepare (declaration/definition) and OS_TaskExit (declaration/definition): OS_TaskEntryPoint calls these functions (they appear in the static call graph). If the pointer/ID is forwarded into either of these routines, their parameter types and behavior (whether they modify the pointed-to data) are required to decide whether the pointer should be const-qualified. In summary, to decide MISRA const-pointer conformance you must inspect the wrapper's member types and the full call chain (OS_TaskEntryPoint and functions it forwards the value to) to see if any callee requires or mutates a non-const pointer."
