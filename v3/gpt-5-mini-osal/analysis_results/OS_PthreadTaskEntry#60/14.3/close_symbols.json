  "explanation": "OS_TaskEntryPoint: The target function only calls OS_TaskEntryPoint and contains no controlling expressions itself. To decide whether the overall behavior constitutes an allowed invariant (for example an intentional infinite loop) or whether any invariant controlling expressions are present in the effective execution of the thread, the callee\u2019s implementation must be inspected. If OS_TaskEntryPoint contains loops with invariant controlling expressions, MISRA allows that only when used to create an intentional infinite loop (exception 1). Also check for attributes (e.g. noreturn) documented on its declaration, since that affects whether a return path exists.\n\nOS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The local variable local_arg is of this type and local_arg.id is passed to OS_TaskEntryPoint. The exact type/layout (union vs struct, member types) is required to understand what is being passed (e.g. integer constant, pointer, boolean-like value) and whether that value could cause any controlling expressions in callees to be invariant.\n\nOS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit: These are direct callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint according to the call graph. Any invariant controlling expressions that arise as part of the task entry logic might be located in these functions. To fully determine whether any invariant controlling expressions are present and whether they meet the MISRA exception for intentional infinite loops, their bodies must be examined as well.\n\n(If OS_TaskEntryPoint/OS_TaskPrepare/OS_TaskExit use macros or named constants inside controlling expressions, those macro/constant definitions will also be needed when they are encountered.)"
