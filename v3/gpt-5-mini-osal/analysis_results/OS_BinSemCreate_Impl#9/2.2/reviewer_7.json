The debug invocation OS_DEBUG(\"Error: pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol failed: %s\\n\", strerror(ret)); therefore expands to nothing and has no runtime effect (strerror is not evaluated).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With #define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) the OS_DEBUG(...) invocation in the function preprocesses to nothing (leaving an empty/null statement) and the strerror(ret) argument is not evaluated. The statement therefore has no runtime effect in this build; removing it would not change program behaviour. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), this is dead code in the given build configuration. (If OS_DEBUG were defined to perform logging, then the call would not be dead.)"
