  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or constructs are present (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, _Pragma with vendor-specific behavior, or other vendor intrinsics).\n- The pthread-style signature (void *arg returning void *) is standard POSIX/C usage, not a compiler extension.\n- The cppcheck suppression comment (/* cppcheck-suppress ... */) is a static-analysis tool directive, not a compiler language extension.\n- The union (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t) usage to store a void * and then read a different member is plain C (not a compiler extension). While union-based type-punning can have portability or implementation-defined semantic concerns, it is not a compiler-specific language extension that would trigger Rule 1.2 reporting.\n- No nonstandard pragmas, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific constructs are present in the shown code or related definitions.\n\nBecause the rule requires reporting only explicit compiler language extensions documented as such by the compiler, there are no fragments to report from the supplied code."
