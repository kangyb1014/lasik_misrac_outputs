  "explanation": "1) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The local variable type must be inspected to understand the semantics of writing to one union member (opaque_arg) and reading another (id). The MISRA invariant rule concerns controlling expressions; knowing the union layout and whether accesses are compile-time constants or produce runtime-dependent values is required to determine if any controlling expression in this function could be invariant.\\n\\n2) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t.opaque_arg: The exact member type and any qualifiers (pointer vs integer, volatile, etc.) are needed to determine whether the assignment local_arg.opaque_arg = arg has any side effects or produces an invariant value for later use.\\n\\n3) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t.id: The type and semantics of the .id member (integer type, constant, macro, computed, etc.) are required to know whether passing local_arg.id to the next call yields a compile-time invariant value that could create an invariant controlling expression in this function.\\n\\n4) OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (declaration/definition / macro expansion): It must be known whether this symbol is a plain function call or a macro that expands into additional statements/controlling constructs within the scope of OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry. If it is a macro, its expansion could introduce controlling expressions (if/while/do/for) into the target function body; those controlling expressions must be inspected to determine if they are invariant. If it is an actual function, its internal control flow is not part of the target function for this MISRA check, but confirming that requires its declaration/definition."
