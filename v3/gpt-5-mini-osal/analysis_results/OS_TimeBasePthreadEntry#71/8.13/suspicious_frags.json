  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve pointers that could or should be const-qualified: the local variable declaration (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;) merely defines storage and does not itself expose pointer const-qualification issues; the call OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread(local_arg.id) passes an integer/ID member (not a pointer) and thus is not related to pointer constness; the return statement (return NULL;) simply returns a NULL pointer constant and does not indicate whether the pointed-to type should be const-qualified. Therefore only the function parameter and the assignment of the incoming pointer to the union member are potential locations where a pointer-to-const might be appropriate and need investigation."
