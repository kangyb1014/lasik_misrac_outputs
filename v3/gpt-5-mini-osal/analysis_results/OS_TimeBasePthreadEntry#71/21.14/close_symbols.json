  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread: This is the direct callee. Its implementation must be inspected to see whether it (or functions it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (definition): The local union/struct determines what local_arg.id actually represents when OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread(local_arg.id) is called. If id contains a char * (string) or is derived from the opaque pointer, that changes whether memcmp might be used on a NUL-terminated string later.\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskDelay_Impl, OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdEqual, OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFromToken: These are the callees listed in the static call graph of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Any of them might call memcmp (directly or via wrappers) to compare identifiers/strings; therefore their implementations must be inspected to detect misuse of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using the standard memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. You must check for direct uses of memcmp in the above functions.\n- strcmp, strncmp: These are the correct string comparison functions for NUL-terminated strings; include them to distinguish whether code uses the appropriate API instead of memcmp (or to see wrappers that forward to these).\n- project string/memory-compare wrappers or macros (e.g. OS_MEMCMP, OS_STRCMP, OS_STRNCMP): Projects often wrap standard functions behind macros or helper functions. These wrappers/macros must be checked because they may expand to memcmp or otherwise perform comparisons that violate the rule.\n\nIn short: to determine if OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry (via OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread and its callees) violates the memcmp-on-NT-string rule you need the implementation/source or prototypes of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread, the full set of functions it calls (listed above), the definition of the union used to pass the argument, and any uses/wrappers of memcmp/strcmp/strncmp so you can detect direct or indirect calls that compare NUL-terminated strings with memcmp."
