Example violating declaration: int32 OS_cp(char *src, char *dest); Passing the const char *src and const char *dest into a function that expects char * discards the const qualification and therefore breaches the requirement that pointer parameters should be const-qualified whenever possible. (If OS_cp is declared as int32 OS_cp(const char *src, const char *dest); then there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 requires pointer declarations to use const where possible. In the shown OS_mv definition the parameters are already const-qualified (const char *src, const char *dest), so OS_mv itself complies with 8.13. Agent A is correct that a violation can occur if the prototype of OS_cp is declared as int32 OS_cp(char *src, char *dest); in that case the OS_cp declaration (not the OS_mv definition) would be non-compliant with 8.13 (it should use const if the function does not modify the data). Moreover, passing a const char * to a function declared to take char * would also be an incompatible/disallowed conversion in standard C (and would be a different MISRA concern about discarding qualifiers or incompatible pointer types). Therefore the report as stated is misleading: the problem would be in the OS_cp prototype (or in the call if it forces a qualifier-discarding cast), not in the shown OS_mv code. Conclusion: the claim is not correct as applied to OS_mv itself."
