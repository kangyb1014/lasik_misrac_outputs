  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (the function signature, the local declaration 'int32 return_code;', the initial call 'return_code = OS_rename(src, dest);', the final 'return return_code;' and the comment) are straightforward and clearly reachable or are runtime-dependent calls whose reachability cannot be statically determined from this translation unit alone. They do not, by themselves, indicate statically unreachable code that would violate MISRA C Rule 2.1 without further information about the implementations or constant values of OS_rename/OS_cp/OS_SUCCESS. Therefore only the conditional blocks and the removal call are flagged for investigation to determine whether any branch can never be taken in the actual project context."
