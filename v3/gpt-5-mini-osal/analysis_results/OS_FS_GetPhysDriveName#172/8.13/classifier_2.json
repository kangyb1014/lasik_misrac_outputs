  "scenario": "The call itself does not necessarily violate Rule 8.13: PhysDriveName must be a modifiable (non-const) char * because it is written to by strncpy. The source argument to strncpy is treated as a const char * by the library, so if filesys->system_mountpt is declared as const char * (or an array of char used read-only) then no Rule 8.13 breach occurs.\n\nA specific violation scenario: if the member is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. \"char *system_mountpt\" or \"char system_mountpt[]\") in OS_filesys_internal_record_t but is only ever read (as here), then it should be declared as \"const char *system_mountpt\" (or \"const char[]\") and the current declaration would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
