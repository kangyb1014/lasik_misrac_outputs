  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter MountPoint is already const-qualified in the prototype, and PhysDriveName is an output buffer so it must be a non-const char*; the token variable and its use with OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) are not related to const qualification; the assignment filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) yields a mutable pointer to the internal table as expected for modifying/inspecting internal state; and the return_code handling and constant macros/flags checks do not involve pointer constness issues. The three listed fragments are the only places in this function where const qualification may be improperly handled (macro usage, an explicit cast to void*, and a source pointer used in strncpy) and therefore should be investigated further."
