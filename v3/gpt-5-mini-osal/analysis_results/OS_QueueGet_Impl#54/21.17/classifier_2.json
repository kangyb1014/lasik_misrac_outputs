  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call is to mq_receive (POSIX message queue API), not a <string.h> function covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Additionally, POSIX specifies that mq_receive fails with errno==EMSGSIZE if the provided buffer is too small (it does not write beyond the buffer), and the surrounding code explicitly checks for EMSGSIZE and handles it. (A hypothetical misuse scenario would be if callers supply an incorrect 'size' that does not match the actual allocation of 'data' or if a non-conforming mq_receive implementation wrote past the buffer; in that case a buffer overflow could occur, so callers must ensure the provided size matches the object.)"
