  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related symbols for any direct or indirect calls that could create recursion back to OS_QueueGet_Impl or OS_QueueGet. The calls made inside OS_QueueGet_Impl are: mq_receive, mq_timedreceive, OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, and the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro which expands to a call to the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accessor. OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime uses clock_gettime and simple arithmetic. None of these functions/macros call OS_QueueGet_Impl or OS_QueueGet (no callbacks, function pointers, or other indirections are present in the provided code). OS_QueueGet calls OS_QueueGet_Impl but there is no path from OS_QueueGet_Impl back to OS_QueueGet. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calls in the supplied code, so no fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 based on the provided material."
