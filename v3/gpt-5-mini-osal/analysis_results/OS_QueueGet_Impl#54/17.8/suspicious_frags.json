  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any of the function parameters themselves. Analysis by parameter:\n- token (const OS_object_token_t *): The code only dereferences *token to index the object table via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro; there is no assignment to token itself. The macro expansion takes the address of the dereferenced token value to compute an index and returns a pointer into the table \u2014 this does not modify the token parameter. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter would be allowed by Rule 17.8, and no such forbidden modification of the pointer variable occurs.\n- data (void *): data is passed to mq_receive/mq_timedreceive; the functions may modify the pointee (allowed), but data the pointer is never reassigned or modified in this function.\n- size (size_t): used as a value parameter for the mq functions and compared; never assigned to or modified.\n- size_copied (size_t *): the code writes to *size_copied (e.g. *size_copied = ...). That modifies the object pointed to, which is explicitly permitted by the rule. The pointer variable size_copied itself is not modified.\n- timeout (int32): used in comparisons and passed by value to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime; it is never assigned to or modified in this function.\nNo increments/decrements, reassignments, or other alterations of the parameter variables themselves are present. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
