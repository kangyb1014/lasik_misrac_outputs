  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig contains no function calls (direct or indirect), no function-pointer dereference, and no macros that expand to function calls. It only performs an integer comparison, an array data access (OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType]), assigns to a local scalar, and returns that scalar. The related symbols shown (OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER macro, extern OS_BSP_Global, and the uint32 typedef) are data or constant definitions and do not introduce recursion. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self-calls)."
