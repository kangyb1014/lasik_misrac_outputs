  "explanation": "- typedef for uint32: To know whether ResourceType and ConfigOptionValue are integer types (unsigned int) or some other type (e.g., pointer). If they are integer types, there is no string comparison here and memcmp would not be applicable.\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (macro or enum definition): To understand the comparison boundary (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER). The type and value of this symbol help determine whether ResourceType is used as an index or as a pointer/handle that might relate to string data.\n- declaration of OS_BSP_Global (global variable): The function reads OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig; the global variable declaration locates the storage and its type so we can inspect the member accessed.\n- definition of the type/struct of OS_BSP_Global (showing the ResoureConfig member): Essential to know the exact type of ResoureConfig (e.g., array of uint32, array of char*, array of structs). If ResoureConfig elements are strings (char* or char[]), then downstream code might use memcmp on those; if they are integer/enum types, then no string comparison occurs here.\n- declaration/definition of ResoureConfig member (array type and element type): The element type determines whether the code is reading numeric configuration values or string pointers/strings. This directly answers whether any memcmp-on-NT-string use could originate from this access.\n- any macro definition or accessor that expands ResoureConfig (if ResoureConfig is a macro): If ResoureConfig is actually implemented via macros or computed accessors, the expansion could hide string operations or calls to memcmp; the macro definition is needed to see that.\n- prototype/declaration of memcmp (for completeness): To detect any indirect use (e.g., via macro or wrapper) and to have the canonical symbol name available when searching for forbidden uses. Having its declaration helps static checks confirm whether memcmp is invoked in or through this code.\n\nTogether these symbols allow a reviewer or static checker to determine whether the access performed here deals with string data (which could lead to memcmp usage that violates the MISRA rule) or with non-string numeric/configuration data (in which case the MISRA memcmp rule is not applicable)."
