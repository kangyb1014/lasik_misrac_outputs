This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can invoke a string.h out\u2011of\u2011bounds access you must confirm that the array indexing is safe and that no hidden string function calls are involved. Specifically: \n- OS_BSP_Global: need the full struct definition to find the ResoureConfig member and its declaration site. Without it you cannot tell whether indexing is into an array or through a pointer. \n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig: its element type and, crucially, whether it is declared as an array with a known compile\u2011time bound or as a pointer. If it is a pointer, the allocation size and provenance matter for bounds. \n- The array bound constant(s): if ResoureConfig is an array, the macro/constant used in its declaration is required to check that the condition (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) guarantees ResourceType is within that bound. \n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: the numeric value of this macro/enum is needed to evaluate the conditional that prevents out\u2011of\u2011bounds indexing. \n- uint32 typedef: to understand the parameter/return type widths (for completeness and to rule out unexpected conversions). \n- Initialization/allocation routine(s) for ResoureConfig: if ResoureConfig is dynamically allocated or assigned, the code that sets its size/contents is required to determine actual runtime bounds and to ensure no string functions were used on this buffer elsewhere.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and values) lets the next analyzer prove that the index test prevents any out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and that no string.h calls are implicated by the accessed object.
