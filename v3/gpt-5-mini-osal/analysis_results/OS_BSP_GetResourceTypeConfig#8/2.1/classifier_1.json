  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment 'ConfigOptionValue = 0;' is in the else branch and is reached whenever the function is called with ResourceType >= OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (0x10). Given ResourceType is a uint32 and there is no provided guarantee that it cannot be >= 0x10, the code is reachable. (It would only be a violation if ResourceType were provably always < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, e.g. by prior validation or a narrower type, which is not shown.)"
