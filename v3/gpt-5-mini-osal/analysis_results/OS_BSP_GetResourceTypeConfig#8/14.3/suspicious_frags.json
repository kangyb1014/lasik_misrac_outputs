  "explanation": "The only conditional controlling expression in the function is: if (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER). This expression is not invariant because ResourceType is a non-constant function parameter (uint32) and can vary at runtime; although OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER is a compile-time constant, the comparison depends on the parameter value and therefore is not a constant controlling expression under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other controlling expressions (for, while, do-while, switch, etc.) in the function to inspect. Consequently, no fragments in this function raise a Rule 14.3 invariant-controlling-expression concern."
