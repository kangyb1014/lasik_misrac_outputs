  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code contains only standard C constructs: a typedef-like integer type name (uint32) which is a user-defined type, a simple if/else, an array index, and a return. There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens or constructs (for example: __attribute__, __asm / asm, typeof, __extension__, statement expressions ({ ... }), labels-as-values, __builtin_*, packed/alignas extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords). The identifier uint32 appears to be a typedef (not a compiler extension), and OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType] is standard array/structure access. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
