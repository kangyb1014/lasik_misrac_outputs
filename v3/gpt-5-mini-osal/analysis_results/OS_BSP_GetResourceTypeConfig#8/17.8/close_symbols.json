  "explanation": "To determine whether the parameter ResourceType is modified (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know whether any referenced symbols can introduce side effects or change the parameter. 1) OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: the value (or macro) used in the comparison may be a macro or expression; its definition is needed to ensure it has no side-effects that could modify ResourceType. 2) OS_BSP_Global: the global object is read via its member; the analyzer must see the actual symbol to ensure that accessing it does not hide any macro or function-like side-effect that could modify the parameter. 3) type/definition of the struct that defines OS_BSP_Global: to inspect the member layout and verify whether ResoureConfig is a plain data array, a macro, or has accessor semantics that could modify arguments. 4) OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (declaration and element type): the exact declaration (array vs pointer, element type, any accessor macros) is needed to confirm that indexing with ResourceType is a read-only operation and does not modify the parameter. 5) uint32 (typedef): to confirm that ResourceType is a value (integral) type and not some pointer/alias type that could allow indirect modification of the caller's object. Together these symbols let an analyzer conclude whether ResourceType itself is ever assigned to or otherwise modified by the function or by expanded macros/side-effects of the referenced symbols."
