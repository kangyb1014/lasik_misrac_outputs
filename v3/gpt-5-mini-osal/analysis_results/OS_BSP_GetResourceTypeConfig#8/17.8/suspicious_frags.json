  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying a function parameter (or, for pointer parameters, modifying the pointer itself). In OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig the parameter ResourceType is only read (used in a comparison and as an array index) and is never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise modified. There are no pointer parameters in this function, so the rule\u2019s pointer-specific restriction does not apply. Therefore no fragments in the provided function violate or even potentially violate Rule 17.8."
