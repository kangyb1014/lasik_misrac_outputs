  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not appear to contain dead code that should be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.2: \n\n- The control flow in OS_GenericRead_Impl (nbytes check, setting operation, calling OS_SelectSingle_Impl only when impl->selectable, and the subsequent conditional read()) is executable and affects behavior (it determines whether read() is invoked and what return_code is produced). Removing any of these statements would change runtime behavior. \n\n- The read() call and its error handling (setting return_code to OS_ERROR or the byte-count cast) are live behavior-critical operations and must be retained. The cast from ssize_t to int32 is a potentially important truncation/portability issue but is not dead code. \n\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET usage and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken logic are used to obtain impl and are required for correct operation; they are not dead. \n\n- In OS_SelectSingle_Impl, the early checks (impl->selectable and fd >= FD_SETSIZE) and the handling of nonzero vs zero SelectFlags (FD_ZERO / FD_SET / OS_DoSelect / updating *SelectFlags) are all reachable and affect behavior depending on inputs; they are not dead. The else branch for *SelectFlags == 0 returns OS_SUCCESS, which is reachable when callers pass zero and therefore not dead in general (even though GenericRead passes a non-zero flag). \n\nTherefore the only clear dead-code candidates in the provided snippets are the OS_DEBUG macro definition (which expands to nothing) and the corresponding call site in OS_GenericRead_Impl, because they have no effect in this build/configuration and could be removed without changing program behavior. These should be investigated to confirm whether the logging should be enabled or the call removed to comply with Rule 2.2."
