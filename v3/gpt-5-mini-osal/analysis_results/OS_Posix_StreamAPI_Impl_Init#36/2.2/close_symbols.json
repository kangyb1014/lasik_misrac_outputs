  "explanation": "For determining whether the operations in OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init are dead code, the analyzer must know if the writes performed by this function (loop setting OS_impl_filehandle_table[i].fd = -1 and assignments to OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID / OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID) have any observable effect on program behaviour or timing, and whether the function itself is ever used. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (definition/declaration, including element type and member 'fd'): The loop writes into this table. To decide if those writes are dead, you must know the table's storage (global vs static), element type, whether 'fd' is actually used later, and any side-effects or volatile qualifiers. If no other code reads these fields or writes them later before any observable use, the initialization may be dead.\n\n- type osal_index_t (typedef): Needed to understand loop semantics (range, signedness, size) and whether the loop executes as expected or is optimized away for zero-length ranges.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): The loop bound depends on this value. If it is 0 or otherwise configured to produce zero iterations, the loop body would not execute, changing the dead-code determination.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID / OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID (declaration/definition, including qualifiers): The function assigns the return values of geteuid/getegid into these globals. To know if those assignments are observable, you must know where these globals are read (or if they are volatile or used in device/privilege checks). If no read occurs, the assignments could be dead.\n\n- geteuid / getegid (declaration/implementation): Although POSIX getters normally have no side effects, the analysis must confirm whether these symbols are standard no-side-effect functions or overridden/aliased in this project with side effects. If they have side effects, the calls may be necessary even if the stored values are unused.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/constant): The return value of the function is OS_SUCCESS. To know if returning this value is observable, you must inspect callers to see if they use the return value to change program behaviour.\n\n- OS_API_Impl_Init (caller of target): If OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init is never called (dead at call-site level), the whole function might be dead. Verify the caller actually invokes it in all build configurations / runtime paths.\n\n- OS_API_Init (caller of OS_API_Impl_Init / higher-level caller chain up to program entry): The analysis must follow the call chain to a program entry (startup/main) to determine whether the caller path that invokes this init function is executed in deployed configurations. If the higher-level init is never invoked, the function may be dead.\n\n- All functions that read/use OS_impl_filehandle_table (list of symbols that access the table): To conclude whether initializing '.fd' values is necessary, identify all readers/writers of the table. If readers exist and rely on the initialized -1 value, the writes are live; if not, they may be dead.\n\n- All functions/places that read/use OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID or OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID (list of symbols): Same rationale as above for the EUID/EGID globals \u2014 their uses determine whether storing geteuid/getegid results is observable.\n\n- Build/configuration headers that define OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES and any compile-time flags affecting initialization (e.g., debug/config macros): The loop and assignments may be compiled differently under different configurations (e.g., table size = 0, disabled subsystems). You must inspect configuration to determine whether the code is ever executed or required.\n\n- Declarations showing qualifiers (volatile/const) and linkage (static/global) for OS_impl_filehandle_table, OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: Volatile or special linkage can make writes observable (via memory-mapped IO, debugger, concurrent observers). If these are volatile or have special attributes, the writes cannot be considered dead.\n\nCollecting these symbols and their usages lets the next analyzer determine (a) whether the function is ever called in any configuration, (b) whether the writes it performs have any observable effect (read later or have side-effects), and (c) whether any side-effects of callees (geteuid/getegid) make the calls live. Without these, you cannot reliably decide compliance with the MISRA dead-code rule."
