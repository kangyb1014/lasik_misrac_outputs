  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\n```c\nint32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)\n{\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /*\n     * init all filehandles to -1, which is always invalid.\n     * this isn't strictly necessary but helps when debugging.\n     */\n    for (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n    {\n        OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n    }\n\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If the global OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID is only written (initialized to 0 at definition and then assigned via OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid() in the init function) and is never subsequently read or used anywhere in the program, then the assignment is dead code. Removing the assignment (and possibly the global) would not affect program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 would be violated."
