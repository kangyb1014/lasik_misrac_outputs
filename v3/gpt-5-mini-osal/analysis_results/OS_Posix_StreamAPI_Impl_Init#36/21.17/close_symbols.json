  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (definition, element type and array length): The loop writes into OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd. To prove there is no out-of-bounds access (which could lead to memory corruption and potentially subsequent illegal string operations), the analyser must know the actual array length/extent and the declared object so it can compare against the loop bound.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table element struct (including fd type and neighbouring members): Knowing the element struct layout and the type of fd verifies that assigning -1 is type-correct and lets you assess whether an out-of-bounds write would affect adjacent members (for example, if adjacent members are char buffers used by string.h functions elsewhere).\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: This constant is the loop limit. Its value is needed to determine whether the loop index can exceed the table bounds.\n- osal_index_t (underlying integer type, signedness and range): The loop index type affects the comparison and iteration semantics (signed/unsigned conversion, maximum representable value). This matters when proving the loop cannot index out of range.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID (declarations/types): These objects are written in this function. Their declarations and types are required to ensure these assignments do not invoke any hidden string handling or cause side-effects relevant to the rule (they normally do not, but the declarations confirm that).\n- geteuid and getegid (prototypes): To confirm these calls are the standard UID/GID retrievals and do not wrap or call string functions indirectly; their prototypes/definitions ensure no unexpected string-handling occurs as a side-effect.\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/definition): The return value used by the function; included for completeness in reasoning about function behaviour (not directly tied to string functions but part of the function contract).\n\nIn short, the critical symbols for proving compliance with the <string.h> bounds rule are the table declaration/size, the loop bound constant, the index type, and the element struct (fd and neighboring fields). The other listed symbols are included to rule out indirect or unexpected uses of string functions or side-effects."
