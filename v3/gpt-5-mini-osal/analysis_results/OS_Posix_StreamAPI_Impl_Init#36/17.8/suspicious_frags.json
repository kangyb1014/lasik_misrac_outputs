  "explanation": "The function has no parameters (signature uses void), so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated here. The loop index local_id is a local variable, not a parameter. The assignment to OS_impl_filehandle_table[...] modifies a global array element (an object), not a function parameter or a pointer parameter itself. The assignments to OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID modify global variables, not parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
