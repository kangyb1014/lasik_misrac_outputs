  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function appear to be invariant under the given definitions. The only loop is\nfor (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\nwhich uses local_id (a uint32 loop variable) as the varying component of the controlling expression; OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES is a compile-time constant (50) but the condition is not invariant because local_id changes each iteration, so it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no other conditional or loop constructs in the function (no if, while, do-while, or switch controlling expressions) to consider. The calls to geteuid() and getegid() and the final return are not controlling expressions. The provided definition OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES = 50 guarantees the loop is well-formed; only in a hypothetical case where OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES were 0 would the loop condition be invariant-false, but that is not the case here. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
