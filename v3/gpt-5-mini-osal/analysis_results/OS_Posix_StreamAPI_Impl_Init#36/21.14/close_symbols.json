  "explanation": "Explainers:\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: The code writes into this global. Its declaration/definition must be inspected to ensure it is an ordinary array/variable and not a macro or accessor function that could expand into or call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- (type) element definition of OS_impl_filehandle_table (struct that contains member fd): The element type (the struct definition) is required to confirm that the assignment to the .fd member is a simple integer assignment rather than a macro or inline function that might internally use memcmp on strings.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd (field): The fd field\u2019s definition (its type and any associated macros) should be checked to ensure the .fd write is not implemented via a macro or function wrapper that uses memcmp.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: This macro/constant must be checked to ensure it is a plain integer constant and not a macro or expression that might involve function calls (or macros) that use memcmp.\n- osal_index_t: The index type definition must be checked to ensure it does not hide a macro or typedef to a type with overloaded semantics or macros that could invoke memcmp.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: These identifiers could be macros or accessor wrappers; their definitions must be inspected to ensure that assigning the result of geteuid()/getegid() is a plain assignment and not routed through a macro or function that internally uses memcmp on strings.\n- geteuid and getegid: Include prototypes/definitions to show these are standard UID/GID retrieval functions (they do not perform string comparisons), so they do not involve memcmp.\n- OS_SUCCESS: Check this macro/constant to ensure it is a simple integer constant and not defined in terms of some expression or function call that might use memcmp.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule being checked disallows use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The target function contains no explicit calls to memcmp, but macros, typedefs, or global objects referenced in the function could expand to or call other code that uses memcmp. The listed symbols are exactly those definitions/macros/types that need to be inspected to conclusively determine whether this function (directly or indirectly via macro expansion or wrapper) uses memcmp on null-terminated strings."
