  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses standard C constructs (for loop, array indexing, assignment, return) and calls POSIX library functions (geteuid, getegid) which are library/API calls, not compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, asm, typeof, __extension__, _Pragma with vendor-specific content, nested functions, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), designated initializer extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords. The typedefs and macros shown (osal_index_t, uint32, OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES, OS_SUCCESS) are ordinary user-defined types/macros, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
