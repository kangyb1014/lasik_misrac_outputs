  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically, I checked for and did not see any of the following known extensions that would require investigation: __attribute__ or other __attribute__ forms, __asm / asm inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) (GCC extension), nested functions, __inline__ / inline compiler-specific variants, GNU C statement labels as expressions, use of compiler builtins with __builtin_*, or any other vendor-specific keywords (e.g., __extension__, __declspec, __fastcall, etc.). The macros and typedefs shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_bin_sem_prop_t, OS_global_bin_sem_table, etc.) use only standard preprocessor and type constructs; the pointer-taking inside the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro (the &(tok) usage) is unusual but is a plain C expression, not a language extension. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
