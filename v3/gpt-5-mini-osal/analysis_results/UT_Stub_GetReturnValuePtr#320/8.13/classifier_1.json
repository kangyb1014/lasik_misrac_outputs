  "scenario": "In UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr the local pointer StubPtr is only used to read members (BasePtr, Position, ContentTypeStr) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Therefore it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr). The current declaration 'UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;' fails to apply const where possible and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
