  "scenario": "Not violated: ReturnPtr is a non-const void* that is returned by UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr to provide access to a mutable return buffer (callers are expected to write into it). Declaring it const would prevent modification and thus would be inappropriate here. A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for read-only access \u2014 in that case it should be declared as const void * (and the function return type adjusted accordingly)."
