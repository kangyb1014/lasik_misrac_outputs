  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr and the related code fragments. The only string comparison in the function is via strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr), not memcmp. The other provided routines/macros (UT_GetStubEntry, UT_StubTableEntry_t, UtAssert_Failed, UtAssert_Abort) do not call memcmp either. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Since there are no uses of memcmp in the supplied code, there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation with respect to this rule."
