  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional expressions are:\n\n- if (StubPtr == NULL) \u2014 StubPtr is obtained at runtime via UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETURN_BUFFER), so the expression depends on the return value of that call and is not invariant.\n\n- if (StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position != ReturnSize || strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr) != 0) \u2014 both operands depend on runtime values (StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position, ReturnSize, and the result of strcmp on runtime strings) and thus are not invariant. The use of strcmp is a runtime library call whose result cannot be considered a constant at compile time.\n\nThere are no loops or other conditionals with constant/compile-time controlling expressions (e.g. if (0), while (1), or other invariant tests) in the provided code. Therefore nothing needs to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
