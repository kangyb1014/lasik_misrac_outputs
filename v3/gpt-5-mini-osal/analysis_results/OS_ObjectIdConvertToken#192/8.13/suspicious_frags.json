  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that involve the token pointer (its declaration and all call/sites that pass or read from token). These are the places that could indicate the pointer should point to a const-qualified type (i.e. OS_object_token_t const *), so they need investigation to determine whether the pointed-to data is modified by this function or by callees and whether prototypes accept a const pointer.\n\nOther fragments were not flagged because they do not involve pointers that could reasonably be const-qualified: the local pointer 'OS_common_record_t *obj' is used to write to the record (obj->active_id, ++obj->refcount, restoring obj->active_id), so the pointed-to type must not be const. No other pointer variables are present in the function. All remaining code operates on scalars (ints, enums) or performs necessary writes to the object record, so they cannot be made to point to const-qualified types and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
