  "scenario": "The function parameter 'token' is declared as OS_object_token_t *token but is only read (token->lock_mode, OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token), OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token), OS_WaitForStateChange(token, ...), OS_Unlock_Global(token)). The fragment 'if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE)' shows a read-only access. Since the function does not modify *token, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_object_token_t *token). Therefore Rule 8.13 is violated."
