True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token) passes a non-const pointer. If the function OS_ObjectIdFromToken is declared to take a plain OS_object_token_t * (i.e. it does not need to modify the token), then that parameter should be const-qualified (const OS_object_token_t *) and thus the current usage violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Example specific violation: if the prototype is \"osal_id_t OS_ObjectIdFromToken(OS_object_token_t *token)\" but the function only reads from *token, the parameter should be changed to \"const OS_object_token_t *token\" to comply.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct (cannot be established from the snippet alone). MISRA 8.13 is about the declaration/definition of pointer types: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. The fact that OS_ObjectIdConvertToken calls OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token) does not by itself prove a violation. To determine a violation you must inspect the declarations/definitions:\n\n- If OS_ObjectIdFromToken is actually declared/defined as osal_id_t OS_ObjectIdFromToken(OS_object_token_t *token) but does not modify *token, then that function's prototype/definition would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to take const OS_object_token_t *.\n\n- Likewise, in the shown code OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(OS_object_token_t *token) reads from token but does not modify it; therefore its own parameter could be const-qualified. As written it may also be noncompliant with 8.13.\n\nBecause the agent only pointed to the call site and we do not have the prototype/definition of OS_ObjectIdFromToken (nor the full project-wide use of token), the agent's claim as stated is not verifiable from the provided code. Recommendation: review the prototypes/definitions of OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken and any other functions taking OS_object_token_t * and make the parameter type const OS_object_token_t * wherever the pointed-to object is not modified. Also ensure callers match the const-correct signatures or use explicit casts only when justified."
