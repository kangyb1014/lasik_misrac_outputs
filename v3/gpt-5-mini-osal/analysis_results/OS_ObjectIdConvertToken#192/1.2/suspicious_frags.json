  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. I examined the function and related macros and found only standard C constructs: compound literal ((osal_id_t){0xFFFFFFFF}) which is a standard C99 feature, normal macros, standard control flow (while, if/else), and no use of known vendor extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other compiler-specific keywords or builtins. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibiting compiler language extensions)."
