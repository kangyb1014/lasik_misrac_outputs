  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses only standard C constructs: function-pointer parameters (void (*Test)(void), etc.), standard library calls (memset, strncpy), the sizeof operator, local automatic objects (UtTestDataBaseEntry), and calls to project functions (UT_BSP_Lock, UtList_Add, UT_BSP_Unlock). Identifiers such as uint32 and UtTestDataBaseEntry_t appear to be typedefs (project or stdint-style) rather than compiler-specific language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __inline or __inline__, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions, #pragma GCC diagnostic, anonymous/unnamed language-extension constructs, or other vendor-specific keywords). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
