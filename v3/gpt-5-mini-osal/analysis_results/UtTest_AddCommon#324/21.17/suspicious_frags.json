  "explanation": "Only the two calls above invoke functions from <string.h> and therefore are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Other lines in the function do not call string.h functions (assignments to function-pointer members, the if (TestName != NULL) check, UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, and the UtList_Add call) and thus cannot directly violate this specific rule. The local declaration of the UtTestDataBaseEntry variable and the subsequent non-string assignment statements do not perform buffered string accesses and so are not relevant to Rule 21.17. (Any concerns about UtList_Add's use of the local object or other non-<string.h> APIs are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
