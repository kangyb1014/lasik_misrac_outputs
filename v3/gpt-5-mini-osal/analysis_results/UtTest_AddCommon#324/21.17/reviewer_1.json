If the caller supplies TestName that is not properly null-terminated or whose allocated length is < n, strncpy may read up to n bytes from TestName and therefore read beyond the bounds of the source object. (The destination is safe because the struct was zeroed beforehand, but the source can be over-read.)\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0879, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad1b0\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad1b0, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 56 78 57 6f 72 6b 73 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 41 50 49 5f 49 6d 70 6c 5f 49 6e 69 74 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_VxWorks_BinSemAPI_Impl_Init\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0941, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad1cf\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad1cf, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 43 72 65 61 74 65 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemCreate_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0b31, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad1e4\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad1e4, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 44 65 6c 65 74 65 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemDelete_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0c41, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad1f9\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad1f9, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 47 69 76 65 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemGive_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0e1d, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad20c\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad20c, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 46 6c 75 73 68 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemFlush_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a0ff9, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad220\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad220, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 54 61 6b 65 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemTake_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a1109, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad233\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad233, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 54 69 6d 65 64 57 61 69 74 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dc0, Test_ptr=0x563b403a13c0, EntryType=2\n  TestName param pointer=0x563b403ad24b\n  About to call strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, src_ptr=0x563b403ad24b, n=39\n  After strncpy: dest_addr=0x7ffdd67f9dd8, dumped up to 39 bytes:\n4f 53 5f 42 69 6e 53 65 6d 47 65 74 49 6e 66 6f 5f 49 6d 70 6c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  As string (up to 39 bytes): 'OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl\\0'\n  Null terminator within first 39 bytes of dest: YES\nENTER UtTest_AddCommon: stack_entry_add\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtTest_AddCommon:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    void (*Test)(void);\n    void (*Setup)(void);\n    void (*Teardown)(void);\n\n    /* Note - the name entry should be long enough to support a GroupName.TestName pattern,\n     * hence why it uses double the OS_MAX_API_NAME length */\n    char TestName[OS_MAX_API_NAME * 2];\n} UtTestDataBaseEntry_t\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. strncpy(dest, src, n) may read up to n characters from the source buffer; the code only checks TestName != NULL and does not ensure that the source object is at least n bytes long or is NUL-terminated within the first n bytes. Zeroing the destination prevents a non-terminated destination string but does not prevent an out-of-bounds read of the source. Although the execution log shows NULs within the first n bytes for the observed calls, MISRA Rule 21.17 forbids code that can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by pointer parameters. To comply, the code must ensure the source cannot be read beyond its bounds (for example use strnlen(TestName, sizeof dest - 1) to determine a safe copy length and then memcpy or copy that length and NUL-terminate, or use a bounds-checked API such as strncpy_s or an approach that limits reads to the actual source object size)."
