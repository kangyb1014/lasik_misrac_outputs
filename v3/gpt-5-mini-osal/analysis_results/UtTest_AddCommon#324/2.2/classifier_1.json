  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtTest_AddCommon:\n```c\nvoid UtTest_AddCommon(void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void), const char *TestName,\n                      uint32 EntryType)\n{\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry_t UtTestDataBaseEntry;\n\n    memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test     = Test;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n    if (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtList_Add(UtAssert_Global.DataBasePtr, &UtTestDataBaseEntry, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t), EntryType);\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the strncpy call is conditional on TestName != NULL and affects program behaviour when a non-NULL TestName is passed (it copies the name into the database entry). Removing that conditional block would change behaviour for calls that provide a TestName, so it is not dead code. (Note: if whole-program analysis proved that TestName is never non-NULL at any call site, then the strncpy would be dead and would violate Rule 2.2, but that is a project-wide property not evident from this fragment.)"
