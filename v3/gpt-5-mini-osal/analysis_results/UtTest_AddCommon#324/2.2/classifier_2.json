  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtTest_AddCommon:\n```c\nvoid UtTest_AddCommon(void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void), const char *TestName,\n                      uint32 EntryType)\n{\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry_t UtTestDataBaseEntry;\n\n    memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test     = Test;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n    if (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtList_Add(UtAssert_Global.DataBasePtr, &UtTestDataBaseEntry, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t), EntryType);\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment stores the Setup function pointer into the local UtTestDataBaseEntry structure which is then passed to UtList_Add (with the structure size). Removing this assignment would change the data written/copied into the test database and thus alter program behaviour. The assignment would only be dead if UtList_Add completely ignored that field or never used the supplied data, which is not the visible case here."
