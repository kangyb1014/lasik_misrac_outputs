  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided target function or in the shown related code fragments. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the form of for loops; therefore only code containing for statements needs investigation. Examination of the provided items:\n\n- OS_TimeBaseGetFreeRun (target): contains parameter checks, a call to OS_ObjectIdGetById, an if, an assignment, and a return \u2014 no for loop.\n- OS_CHECK_POINTER macro: expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL, ...); no for loop.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById (provided implementation): uses calls, conditionals and returns, but no for loops.\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro: simple array access via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken; the macro itself contains no for loop.\n- Type and array declarations (OS_timebase_internal_record_t, OS_timebase_table, typedefs, constants): no for loops.\n\nThe only remaining places that could contain for loops would be in functions/macros that are referenced but not shown (for example OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, BUGCHECK, or any other helper not provided). Those are not part of the supplied code and therefore cannot be marked here. If you can supply the implementations of those referenced routines/macros, I will re-evaluate them for any for loops that should be investigated under Rule 14.2."
