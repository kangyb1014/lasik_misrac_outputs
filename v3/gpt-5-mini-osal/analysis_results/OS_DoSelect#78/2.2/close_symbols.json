  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to determine whether OS_DoSelect contains dead code:\n\n- OS_SelectSingle_Impl\n  - It is one of the callers of OS_DoSelect. To decide whether particular branches in OS_DoSelect are ever executed (and therefore whether code in those branches is \"dead\"), we must know how callers compute and pass the msecs argument and how they use the return value. If the caller always supplies a particular range of msecs (e.g. always >0 or always <0) some branches in OS_DoSelect (and operations there) could be removable without changing program behavior.\n\n- OS_SelectMultiple_Impl\n  - Same reason as above for the other caller. Additionally, this caller uses fd-set conversion helpers before/after calling OS_DoSelect; those conversions determine whether rd_set/wr_set can be NULL or empty, which affects the select call paths and whether parts of OS_DoSelect are ever reached.\n\n- OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl\n  - Called by OS_SelectMultiple_Impl to build the fd_set arguments passed to OS_DoSelect. Knowledge of this routine is needed to determine whether rd_set and/or wr_set can be NULL, empty, or always non-empty \u2014 which changes whether select is ever called or whether some code that handles particular tv values is relevant.\n\n- OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl\n  - Called after select by the multiple-select caller to propagate results. Whether callers rely on specific return codes or post-select conversions affects whether assignments to return_code in OS_DoSelect are observable; needed to decide if those assignments (or whole cases) are dead.\n\n- select (POSIX function)\n  - The body of OS_DoSelect calls select and retries on specific errno values. To determine whether the retry loop (do...while) and the errno-based branching can ever be exercised (or are removable), we need the documented semantics of select: its possible return values, when it sets errno, and whether it can return -1 with EINTR or EAGAIN on the target platform.\n\n- clock_gettime (POSIX function)\n  - Used to compute absolute timeout (ts_now/ts_end) and remaining tv. To know if the time-calculation branches (msecs>0 path) are meaningful or can be removed, we must know whether clock_gettime is available and its error/behavior characteristics on the platform (e.g. whether it can fail or return values that make computed tv negative).\n\n- errno (global) and EINTR, EAGAIN (macros)\n  - The retry loop condition depends directly on errno being EINTR or EAGAIN after select failure. To establish whether the loop and associated code (recomputing tv, checking and breaking on timeouts) are ever executed, we must know the platform behavior that sets errno and the meaning of these macros.\n\n- memset\n  - OS_DoSelect explicitly calls memset(&ts_end,0,...). Determining whether that memset is required (i.e. whether ts_end is later read when msecs<=0) or removable as dead code requires confirming there are no side effects and that ts_end is unused in those cases.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_ERROR_TIMEOUT, OS_SUCCESS\n  - These return-code symbols define observable behavior of OS_DoSelect (what callers see). To determine if assignments to return_code (the three final branches) are relevant or could be removed without changing program behavior, we need to know how callers interpret these values (e.g., if callers ignore the return or treat some codes equivalently).\n\n- struct timespec, struct timeval\n  - The code relies on the signedness/width/field names (tv_sec, tv_nsec, tv_usec) and arithmetic on these fields. To reason about reachability of branches that adjust tv_sec/tv_usec (e.g., carrying/norming when ns >= 1e9 or usec < 0), we need the exact definitions/type widths so we can determine whether those adjustments can or cannot occur on the target platform.\n\n- fd_set\n  - The select arguments are fd_set pointers. Knowledge of the fd_set representation and whether callers can pass NULL or empty sets affects whether select is effectively a pure timeout wait and which code paths in OS_DoSelect are exercised.\n\nNotes: The above list targets symbols that affect which statements and branches in OS_DoSelect are ever executed and whether their removal would change program behavior (the key criterion for MISRA dead-code detection). Inspecting the caller implementations (OS_SelectSingle_Impl and OS_SelectMultiple_Impl) and the platform behavior of select/clock_gettime/errno/macros is essential to reach a sound conclusion about dead code in OS_DoSelect."
