  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified when possible, the analyzer must know the actual types and const-qualification of the objects the code takes addresses of and passes to inet_pton:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to see how Addr is declared and whether Addr->AddrData (the underlying storage) is declared const or not. If AddrData is const, taking a non-const pointer would be a violation.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: required to see the accessor type used via the cast and whether it or its members are const-qualified.\n- OS_SockAddr_t::AddrData (member): explicit knowledge of this member is needed because the code casts &Addr->AddrData to an accessor pointer; the member's type/qualifiers determine if the cast discards const.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t::sa, ::sa_in, ::sa_in6 (members): the code uses these members to compute addrbuffer. Their declared types and qualifiers (const or not) determine whether taking their addresses yields a const pointer that is later passed to a non-const parameter.\n- struct in_addr (type of sin_addr): to know whether sin_addr is declared with any const qualifiers (and its exact type/size) which affects whether a non-const pointer is required or whether a const pointer could have been used.\n- struct in6_addr (type of sin6_addr): same reason as in_addr for the IPv6 path.\n- inet_pton (prototype): crucial to know the parameter types. If inet_pton's destination parameter is void * (non-const) then a non-const pointer is required; if it were const void * (it is not), then passing a non-const pointer might be unnecessary. The prototype confirms the function writes to the buffer.\n- sa_family_t (type of sa.sa_family): needed to ensure the switch is over the correct type and to confirm no implicit qualification issues arise from using that member (not a const-related issue usually, but required to fully understand member declarations).\n\nKnowing these symbols allows an analyst to determine whether any pointer is unnecessarily non-const (e.g., whether the code discards const qualifiers when taking addresses or when casting Addr->AddrData to a non-const accessor) and whether the non-constness is required because inet_pton writes into the destination buffer."
