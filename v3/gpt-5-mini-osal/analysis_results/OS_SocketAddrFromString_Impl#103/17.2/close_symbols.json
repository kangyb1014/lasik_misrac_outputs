  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine not only the target but its callers and any callees of those callers that could call back into the target. Specifically:\n\n- OS_SocketAddrFromString: This is the direct caller of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl (per the static call graph). You must inspect its body to see whether it calls OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl only, or whether it also calls other functions (or itself) that could form a call cycle back to OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl.\n\n- OS_printf: Although likely harmless, any function called by OS_SocketAddrFromString must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call back to OS_SocketAddrFromString or OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl, which would create indirect recursion.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType and UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData: These registration functions may store callbacks, handlers, or context that later get invoked. You need their implementations to determine whether they create indirect invocation paths (e.g., by registering OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl or a wrapper as a callback) or otherwise enable recursion.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: This is especially important \u2014 it likely invokes registered handlers or test stubs. If it eventually invokes a handler that calls OS_SocketAddrFromString or OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl, that establishes indirect recursion. Inspect its implementation and any call graph out of it.\n\n- UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: Accessor functions like this can return pointers (including function pointers) or data that leads to further calls; check whether its behavior can produce a call back into the target.\n\n- UT stub registry data structures / function-pointer registration (handlers) used by the UT_* APIs: The runtime registration data (the registry of handlers/callbacks and their types) is required to determine which functions may be invoked by UT_ExecuteBasicHandler (or related UT APIs). If any registered handler can call OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl (directly or through a chain), that creates an indirect recursion. Inspecting these registry symbols and the types/values stored is necessary for a complete recursion analysis.\n\nIn short: inspect the caller OS_SocketAddrFromString and all functions it calls (the listed OS_/UT_* symbols) and the UT registration/handler machinery to ensure there is no path that leads back to OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl, which would violate the MISRA rule against (direct or indirect) self-calls."
