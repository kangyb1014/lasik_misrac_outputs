  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The function parameters are Addr (OS_SockAddr_t *) and string (const char *). There are no assignments to Addr or string, nor any increments/decrements or rebindings of these parameter variables. The code takes addresses of fields inside the object pointed to by Addr (via Accessor and addrbuffer) and passes that address to inet_pton, which may modify the object referred to by Addr \u2014 this is explicitly allowed by the rule. The const string parameter is not written to. All other pointers (Accessor, addrbuffer) are local variables. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation for this rule."
