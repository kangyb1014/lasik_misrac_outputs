  "explanation": "The default case contains a 'break;' immediately after 'return', which is unreachable/redundant and should be investigated (even though unreachable code is not classified as dead by the MISRA note, the presence of unreachable statements can indicate maintenance issues or overlooked dead operations). The AF_INET6 case (inside the #ifdef) is flagged because conditional compilation can make that whole case effectively unused in some build configurations \u2014 it should be checked in the target build configurations to determine whether it becomes dead code. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the AF_INET case assigns addrbuffer which is subsequently used by inet_pton; the Accessor assignment is used; the inet_pton call and its result check are active operations that affect behaviour; the final return statements are necessary. The case 'break;' statements for the handled cases are required to preserve switch semantics and are not dead. "
