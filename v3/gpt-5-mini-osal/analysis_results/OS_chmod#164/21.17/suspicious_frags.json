  "explanation": "The only places that could involve calls to <string.h> functions (or write/read via pointers into buffers) are the local_path buffer, its size macro, and the calls that pass that buffer to other routines. These must be investigated to ensure any string/memory operations provided by OS_TranslatePath or OS_FileChmod_Impl do not access beyond the bounds of local_path or the source 'path'. Other fragments (function signature, the return_code variable declaration/assignment, and the final return) do not perform buffer or string operations and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 compliance."
