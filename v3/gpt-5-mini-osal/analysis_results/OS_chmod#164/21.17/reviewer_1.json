  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_chmod code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_chmod.\n```c\nint32 OS_chmod(const char *path, uint32 access_mode)\n{\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileChmod_Impl(local_path, access_mode);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nOS_TranslatePath(local_path) is called with a caller-supplied path buffer but no length is passed; if OS_TranslatePath uses string.h functions (e.g. strcpy(local_path, path), strcat, memcpy(local_path, path, strlen(path)+1), or otherwise copies/appends without bounds checks) and the input path (or the composed translated path) has length >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, the function will write beyond local_path and violate Rule 21.17. In other words, unless OS_TranslatePath guarantees it will never write more than OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes into local_path, this call is a potential violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_chmod:\n#define OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN (OS_MAX_PATH_LEN+OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not provably correct based on the code shown. The function OS_chmod itself does not call any <string.h> routines; it merely declares a local buffer local_path and passes it to OS_TranslatePath. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions that may access beyond the bounds of objects referenced by pointer parameters. Any actual violation would occur inside OS_TranslatePath (or any other function that writes into local_path) if that function uses unsafe string.h calls or fails to enforce the buffer size. Without the implementation or a contract/specification for OS_TranslatePath that shows it writes more than OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes (or uses unsafe string.h calls without bounds checking), you cannot conclude that OS_chmod itself violates Rule 21.17. Thus Agent A\u2019s report describes a plausible risk (a potential violation if OS_TranslatePath is unsafe), but it is not a confirmed MISRA 21.17 violation based solely on the presented code. To resolve this definitively, inspect the implementation or specification of OS_TranslatePath (or change the API to pass the destination size or use bounded-string APIs)."
