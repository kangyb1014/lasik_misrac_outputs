  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the presented fragment: the macro only defines a size (OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN) and does not call any <string.h> functions, so Rule 21.17 is not directly violated. A concrete violation scenario (if one existed elsewhere) would be: OS_TranslatePath or other code uses an unbounded string function such as strcpy(local_path, path) or memcpy(local_path, source, strlen(source)+1) when strlen(path) >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, causing writes beyond local_path and thus violating Rule 21.17."
