  "scenario": "If OS_FileChmod_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. int32 OS_FileChmod_Impl(char *path, uint32 access_mode)) but does not actually modify the path buffer, then Rule 8.13 is violated because the pointer parameter should be const-qualified (const char *). In other words, passing the local_path (char array) to a callee that could accept a const char * but is instead declared to take char * is a violation. (If, however, OS_FileChmod_Impl legitimately modifies the path buffer, then no violation occurs.)"
