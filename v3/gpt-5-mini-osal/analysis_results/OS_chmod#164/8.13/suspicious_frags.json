  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_FileChmod_Impl(local_path, access_mode);",
    "char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];"
  ],
  "explanation": "The function parameter 'path' is already const-qualified, so it conforms to Rule 8.13 and does not need investigation. The call to OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) is expected to write into local_path (it is the destination buffer), so local_path must be a mutable array and that use is appropriate. Other statements (the return_code variable and return return_code;) do not involve pointer-to-non-const issues. The only potential concern is passing the non-const local_path to OS_FileChmod_Impl: if OS_FileChmod_Impl does not modify the string, its prototype should accept a pointer to const; thus the declaration of the local buffer and the call into OS_FileChmod_Impl are the fragments that should be investigated."
