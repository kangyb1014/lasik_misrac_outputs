True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf OS_FileChmod_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. int32 OS_FileChmod_Impl(char *path, uint32 access_mode)) but does not actually modify the path buffer, then Rule 8.13 is violated because the pointer parameter should be const-qualified (const char *). In other words, passing the local_path (char array) to a callee that could accept a const char * but is instead declared to take char * is a violation. (If, however, OS_FileChmod_Impl legitimately modifies the path buffer, then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when possible. In the shown OS_chmod implementation the external parameter path is already declared const char * (correct), and local_path is a modifiable char array (necessary because OS_TranslatePath writes into it). Thus OS_chmod itself does not contain a pointer that should be const-qualified. If there is a violation it would be in the declaration of OS_FileChmod_Impl: if that function takes char * but does not modify the buffer, then OS_FileChmod_Impl\u2019s parameter should be declared const char * (and that function would violate 8.13). But that is an issue in the callee\u2019s prototype, not in the OS_chmod code shown. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim that this OS_chmod code violates Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
