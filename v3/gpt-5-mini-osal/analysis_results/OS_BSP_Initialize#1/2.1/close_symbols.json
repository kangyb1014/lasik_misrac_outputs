  "explanation": "For determining unreachable code in OS_BSP_Initialize you need the semantics (return values and possible side effects) of the following symbols:\n\n- geteuid\n  - Needed to decide whether the entire /proc file-open branch (if (geteuid() != 0)) can ever be taken; i.e., what values it may return (root == 0 vs non-root >0).\n\n- fopen\n  - Needed to determine whether the fp != NULL branch is reachable on relevant platforms and configurations (opening \"/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max\").\n\n- fgets\n  - Needed to know whether the inner block that calls strtoul/OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C/BSP_DEBUG is reachable when fp is non-NULL (fgets returns NULL on EOF/error).\n\n- fclose\n  - Included for completeness of file-handling behavior, but not normally affecting reachability; still needed to reason about the fp-handling path.\n\n- strtoul\n  - Needed to know its behavior when parsing the buffer (returns a value; cannot make the surrounding code unreachable), and whether it can set errno or have side effects relevant to reachability.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C (macro)\n  - Needed to know if this macro can expand to something that might render the assignment or subsequent code unreachable (e.g., static assertions, compile-time traps, or no-ops).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth (symbol)\n  - Needed to confirm assignment is a normal run-time store and does not, for example, expand to something that prevents reachability (e.g., an assert-like macro or abort in its setter).\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro/function)\n  - Debug logging macros can expand to code that affects control flow (e.g., assert-like behavior, abort, or conditional compilation). Must know whether BSP_DEBUG may make the debug-printing branches effectively unreachable or introduce control-flow changes.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_init\n  - Critical: the code tests if (status < 0). POSIX returns 0 on success and a positive error number on failure. To determine if the if (status < 0) branch is reachable you must know its return value convention (range and sign).\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol\n  - Same rationale as pthread_mutexattr_init: need return-value semantics to decide whether the following if (status < 0) checks can be true.\n\n- pthread_mutex_init\n  - Same rationale: need to know whether it can return negative values or only 0/positive error codes, which affects reachability of the associated error-reporting branch.\n\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT (macro/enum)\n  - Needed only to confirm that calling pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol with this value is a normal code path and does not expand to something that removes or alters reachability.\n\n- strerror\n  - The code calls strerror(status) inside the status<0 branches; to reason about whether passing the status here is meaningful and whether strerror may have side effects that affect reachability, its semantics should be known.\n\nIn short: to decide whether the status<0 error-reporting branches are unreachable (a likely MISRA unreachable-code issue) you need the concrete return-value conventions for the pthread_* functions and any macros (BSP_DEBUG, OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C) that might change control flow. The stdio functions and strtoul are needed to determine reachability of the /proc read path."
