  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG: This is a project macro or function used for logging/formatting. Its definition may expand to code that compares strings (or calls other project functions that do), so it must be inspected for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: Macro/function used to compute/truncate queue depth. As a project macro it may contain string handling or call project helpers that could (improperly) use memcmp for null-terminated strings; inspect its expansion/implementation.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: Global structure/variable whose member MaxQueueDepth is assigned. The declaration/initialization code for this symbol (or any accessor functions) might contain string-comparison code; include to see related project-level code that could use memcmp.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: Global structure containing AccessMutex. Its type/initializers or related accessors could be implemented in project code that uses memcmp on strings; include to be safe.\n\n- geteuid: Typically a libc call, but if the project provides a wrapper or compatibility shim for geteuid, that wrapper could use memcmp. Verify whether the used symbol is the standard library or a project-provided function.\n\n- fopen, fgets, fclose, strtoul, strerror: Standard C library functions used by this routine. While libc internals may use memcmp, the MISRA rule usually targets project source; still check whether these symbols are mapped to project wrappers/implementations (or macros) that might use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init: POSIX functions called here. If the build uses project wrappers or compatibility layers for pthread functions, those wrappers must be inspected for memcmp usage.\n\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: Macro whose definition could be project-provided or mapped; include to confirm there is no unexpected macro expansion that uses memcmp.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To determine whether OS_BSP_Initialize violates this rule you must inspect not only the visible code in the function but also any project-defined macros, wrappers, or helper symbols it invokes or expands to (BSP_DEBUG, OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C, globals and any nonstandard wrappers). Standard libc/pthread implementations are normally out of scope, but any project-supplied replacements or wrappers for these symbols must be examined as well."
