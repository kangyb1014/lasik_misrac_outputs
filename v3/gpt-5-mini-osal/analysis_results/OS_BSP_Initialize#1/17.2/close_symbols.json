  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_Initialize violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- main: caller of OS_BSP_Initialize; needed to inspect the broader application call graph for cycles back to OS_BSP_Initialize.\n- OS_Application_Startup, OS_Application_Run, OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus: functions called by main (per static call graph). Any of these could (directly or indirectly) call OS_BSP_Initialize, creating an indirect recursion cycle, so their bodies/call graphs must be known.\n- BSP_DEBUG: used in OS_BSP_Initialize; may be a macro or function that could call other application code (potentially OS_BSP_Initialize) \u2014 must inspect its expansion/definition.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: macro used to adjust MaxQueueDepth; macros may expand to function calls or expressions that call application functions, so its definition is required.\n- OS_BSP_Global and OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: global objects modified/used by the function. Other functions that access these globals might call back into OS_BSP_Initialize; their definitions/usages help detect indirect cycles.\n- geteuid, fopen, fgets, fclose, strtoul, strerror: standard/library calls invoked by OS_BSP_Initialize. While standard C library functions normally do not call application functions, their use should be acknowledged; if any are replaced/overridden in this build (e.g., weak hooks), they could introduce callbacks.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init: POSIX thread APIs used here. If the application provides wrappers or callbacks around threading init that could call back into application code, those wrappers/implementations must be examined.\n\nIn short: include all direct callees (and any macros that expand to calls) plus the immediate callers from the program entry (main and its callees) so the full local call graph can be inspected for cycles leading back to OS_BSP_Initialize."
