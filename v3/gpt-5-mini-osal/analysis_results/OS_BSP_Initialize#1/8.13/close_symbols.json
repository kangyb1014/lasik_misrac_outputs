  "explanation": "For applying the MISRA rule about pointers pointing to const-qualified types where possible you must inspect the declarations/definitions of all functions, types and macros used by OS_BSP_Initialize that involve pointers or pointer returns (to determine whether parameters/returns could/should be const):\n\n- fopen\n  - Need the prototype to confirm const qualification of its parameters (const char *pathname, const char *mode) and return type (FILE *). Verifies that passing a string literal is to a const parameter.\n\n- fgets\n  - Prototype (char *fgets(char *s, int, FILE *)) is required to show the buffer parameter is non-const (it is written). This demonstrates that a non-const pointer is appropriate here.\n\n- fclose\n  - Prototype (int fclose(FILE *)) to check whether FILE * is non-const (it is) and that passing fp is correct with respect to constness.\n\n- strtoul\n  - Prototype (unsigned long strtoul(const char *, char **, int)) is required to confirm it takes a const char * parameter; passing buffer (char[]) to a const parameter is allowed and expected.\n\n- strerror\n  - Prototype (char *strerror(int)) is required because its return type is a pointer; MISRA may prefer const char * for read-only messages \u2014 need the actual declaration to judge compliance.\n\n- FILE (type definition)\n  - The FILE type definition is needed to see whether any const qualification is expected on FILE * parameters/returns in this environment.\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro/function)\n  - Its declaration/definition is needed to see the type of its format/string parameter(s) (const vs non-const) and whether it returns/accepts char * in a way that could violate the const-pointer rule.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C (macro/function)\n  - Definition is required to see whether it involves pointer casts or returns a pointer type that could need const qualification (or hides casts that remove const).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global (symbol/struct and MaxQueueDepth field type)\n  - Needed to know the type of MaxQueueDepth (is it an integer or pointer?) to check whether any pointer constness issues arise from the assignment.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (symbol/struct and AccessMutex field type)\n  - Required to confirm AccessMutex type (likely pthread_mutex_t) and whether taking its address and passing to pthread_mutex_init interacts with const qualification.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_t (type)\n  - The type definition is needed to see whether attr objects should be treated as const in certain APIs; also to check whether passing &mutex_attr to APIs matches const qualification.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t (type)\n  - Needed to confirm the expected type of AccessMutex and pointer parameter types used by pthread_mutex_init.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_init\n  - Prototype (int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *)) is required to confirm it takes a non-const pointer (it initializes the object) so non-const is appropriate.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol\n  - Prototype (int pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *, int)) is required to confirm it expects a non-const pointer (it modifies the attr) and thus non-const is correct.\n\n- pthread_mutex_init\n  - Prototype (int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *, const pthread_mutexattr_t *)) is required to confirm the second parameter is a const pointer type (so passing &mutex_attr, a non-const pointer, is allowed) \u2014 important for MISRA assessment.\n\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT (macro)\n  - Value not a pointer, but include its definition to ensure it is used only as an integer constant and does not hide any pointer-cast macro.\n\nIn short: you must inspect the function prototypes and type definitions for all functions/objects that involve pointers or pointer returns used in the function (fopen, fgets, fclose, strtoul, strerror, FILE, pthread APIs, BSP/OS symbols and macros) to determine whether any parameter or return should be const-qualified or is improperly used without const."
