  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies to string.h functions such as memcpy/strlen/strcpy/etc.; the code uses strtoul (from <stdlib.h>) not one of those functions. In addition, buffer is populated with fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp) which guarantees null-termination, so strtoul(buffer, NULL, 10) will not read beyond the bounds. (A specific violation scenario would be if buffer were not null-terminated \u2014 e.g. filled by a raw read() into buffer without adding a terminator \u2014 then calling a string consumer such as strtoul or any <string.h> function could read past buffer and violate the rule.)"
