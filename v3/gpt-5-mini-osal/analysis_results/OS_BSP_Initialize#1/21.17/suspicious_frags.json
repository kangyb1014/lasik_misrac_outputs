  "explanation": "All other lines in the function do not invoke string-handling routines that can read from or write into user-provided buffers (they are control flow, file open/close, permission checks, or pthread API calls). Therefore they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, which concerns use of string functions that can access beyond object bounds. The listed fragments are the only points in this function that (a) declare or operate on an in-scope character buffer, or (b) call functions that process or return C strings and so should be inspected for possible out-of-bounds accesses or improper usage."
