  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_Initialize uses any compiler/language extensions (per the MISRA rule), the analyzer needs the definitions or declarations of all external types, macros, and functions used by the function because those definitions are where extensions would appear. Specifically:\n\n- FILE, fopen, fgets, fclose: Standard I/O types/functions \u2014 need their declarations/headers to ensure no non\u2011standard variants or extensionized replacements are used.\n- geteuid: POSIX call \u2014 need its declaration to check for platform-specific extension usage or wrapper macros.\n- strtoul, NULL: Standard library symbols \u2014 check their definitions/macros for any compiler extensions.\n- BSP_DEBUG: Likely a logging macro; macros often hide compiler extensions (statement expressions, __attribute__, GCC builtins, inline assembly, variadic/extension-specific constructs). The macro body must be inspected.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: Macro/function-like macro used to set MaxQueueDepth \u2014 its definition may use compiler extensions (cast tricks, typeof, statement expressions, attributes) that would violate the rule.\n- OS_BSP_Global and OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The global object and field type/definition must be checked to see if its declaration uses compiler-specific attributes, nonstandard type qualifiers, or extension features.\n- pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init, PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: POSIX threads types/macros/functions \u2014 their declarations/macros should be inspected for vendor-specific extensions or nonstandard attributes/macros.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal and OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex: The global object and its mutex member declarations may contain compiler-specific annotations or nonstandard typedefs that would be language extensions.\n- strerror: Standard library function; check declaration for extensions.\n\nInspecting the above symbols (declarations/definitions and any included headers or macro bodies) is sufficient to detect common language extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__ usage, inline assembly, statement expressions ({...; ({...;})}), typeof, compiler builtins, or other documented compiler-specific extensions that could be hidden behind macros or typedefs used in this function."
