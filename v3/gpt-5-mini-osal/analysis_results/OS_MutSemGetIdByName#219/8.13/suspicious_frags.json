  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the local variable declaration (int32 return_code;) and the return statement (return return_code;) do not involve pointer types. The sem_name parameter is already const-qualified in the signature, so it does not violate the rule. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-using expressions in this function beyond the listed fragments, so no additional checks for missing const-qualification are required here."
