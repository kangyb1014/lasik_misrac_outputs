  "explanation": "No call to memcmp is present in any of the provided code fragments. The shown functions (OS_MutSemGetIdByName, OS_ObjectIdFindByName, OS_ObjectIdGetByName, OS_ObjectIdRelease) only perform pointer checks, length checks, and forward the name pointer to an object-search API; none of these fragments invoke memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nThe only locus where a memcmp-based string comparison might appear is the comparator passed into OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch (here referenced as OS_ObjectNameMatch) or inside OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch itself, but the implementations of OS_ObjectNameMatch and OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch are not included in the provided code. Those implementations should be investigated for uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings. All other shown fragments do not warrant investigation for Rule 21.14 because they do not perform string comparisons themselves."
