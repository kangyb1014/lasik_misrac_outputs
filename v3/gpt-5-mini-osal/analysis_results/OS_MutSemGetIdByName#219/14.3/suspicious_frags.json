  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that contain controlling expressions or macro calls that are likely to expand to controlling expressions. These are the places that could potentially create invariant (constant) controlling expressions and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other code fragments were not listed because they do not contain selection/iteration controlling expressions (for example: simple return statements, plain function calls without conditionals, assignments, buffer writes, va_start/va_end, vsnprintf call, OS_ConsoleWrite, and functions that only forward calls). Such statements cannot violate Rule 14.3 because they do not introduce controlling expressions, or their controlling expressions are clearly based on variables/return values (e.g. comparisons with return_code, actualsz, or global state) rather than syntactic constants. Therefore they do not need investigation for this specific rule."
