  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are manifestly invariant. The function contains two conditional controls: 1) if (POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities) \u2014 this depends on a global variable and is not a compile-time constant; 2) if (ret != 0) \u2014 this depends on the runtime return value of pthread_setschedprio. There are no loops or other control statements with constant expressions. Macro/function calls (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_PriorityRemap, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger) are not used as controlling expressions here; their expansions could be reviewed if there is concern, but based on the provided code no invariant controlling expressions that would contravene MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 are present."
