True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIn OS_SocketSendTo the local variable is declared as:\n\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\nWithin the shown function the pointer is only used to read members (e.g. stream->socket_type) and is not used to modify the pointee. Therefore the pointer could and should be declared pointing to a const-qualified type (const OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream). As written it does not use const and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If elsewhere in the function or via APIs the pointee is actually modified, then a non-const pointer would be required and no violation would occur.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct for the shown code. The local pointer stream is only used to read members (stream->socket_type) and the pointee is not modified in this function, so it can and should be declared as a pointer to const: const OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream; This satisfies MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The only caveat would be if elsewhere in this function (not shown) or via calls that use stream the object is modified or APIs require a non-const pointer; in that case the non-const declaration would be justified. Given the provided snippet, however, the agent\u2019s claim is valid."
