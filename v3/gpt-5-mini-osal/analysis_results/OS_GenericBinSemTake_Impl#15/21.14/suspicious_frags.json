  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided target function and all additional code. There are no calls to the standard library function memcmp anywhere in the fragments. There are also no indirect uses of memcmp via wrappers or macros in the shown code (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex and OS_Posix_BinSemReleaseMutex do not call memcmp; OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken do not perform any string comparisons). The code manipulates pthread types, timespec, and integer/volatile counters only \u2014 there are no null-terminated strings or string-comparison operations present that could involve memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided sources that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
