True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe macro takes the address of the supplied token expression: & (tok). In OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl the call is OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) where token is declared const OS_object_token_t *token. That yields a const OS_object_token_t * being passed to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET. If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t * (i.e. it does not use a pointer-to-const), this discards the const qualifier and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A fix is to declare OS_ObjectIndexFromToken to take const OS_object_token_t * (or otherwise preserve const qualification).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_bin_sem_table[OS_MAX_BIN_SEMAPHORES]\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t       id;\n    pthread_cond_t        cv;\n    volatile sig_atomic_t flush_request;\n    volatile sig_atomic_t current_value;\n} OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t\n...\nint32 OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(pthread_mutex_t *mut)\n{\n    struct timespec timeout;\n\n    if (clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &timeout) != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    timeout.tv_sec += OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS;\n\n    if (pthread_mutex_timedlock(mut, &timeout) != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_Posix_BinSemReleaseMutex(void *mut)\n{\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(mut);\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct in principle. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) expands to call OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)). In OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl the macro is invoked as OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token). Given token is declared const OS_object_token_t *token, the expression *token has type const OS_object_token_t, so &( *token ) has type const OS_object_token_t *. If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t * parameter, the const qualifier would be discarded when passing the argument \u2014 this is a qualifier-discard and should be considered a violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified type whenever possible). Therefore the report is correct provided the actual declaration of OS_ObjectIndexFromToken indeed lacks the const qualification. If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a const OS_object_token_t * then there is no violation. The appropriate fix (if the function lacks const) is to change its parameter to const OS_object_token_t * (or otherwise preserve const qualification)."
