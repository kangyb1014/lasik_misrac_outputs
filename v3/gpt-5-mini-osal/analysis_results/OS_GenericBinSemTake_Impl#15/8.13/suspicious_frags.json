  "explanation": "Others parts of the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or they necessarily require mutable pointers: - The function parameters token and timeout are already declared as pointers to const-qualified types. - Accesses to sem->current_value, sem->flush_request and updates (sem->current_value = 0) modify the semaphore state, so pointers to non-const are required. - pthread_cond_wait/pthread_cond_timedwait and pthread_mutex_* APIs operate on and modify pthread_mutex_t/pthread_cond_t objects; these APIs require non-const pointers, so those calls are not candidates for adding const qualification. - The usage of the condition variable and mutex addresses (&(sem->cv), &(sem->id)) are passed to APIs that modify the pointed objects, so they must remain non-const. The listed fragments were chosen because they involve taking addresses/typing via macros or using generic void* signatures where a const qualification might be overlooked (macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET with &(tok) and the OS_Posix_* functions). All other pointer uses in the shown code are either already const-qualified or legitimately non-const because the pointed-to objects are modified or required by external APIs."
