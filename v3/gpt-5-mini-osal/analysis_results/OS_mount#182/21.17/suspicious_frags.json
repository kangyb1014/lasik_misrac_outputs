  "explanation": "Only calls or invocations that can involve the <string.h> string-handling functions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The listed fragments either directly use a string.h function (strncpy) or are macro invocations (OS_CHECK_STRING) that commonly perform string-length/bounds checks and therefore need inspection to ensure they do not read past the source buffers. The remaining code does not invoke standard string.h functions and thus is not relevant to Rule 21.17: declarations and local variable definitions, OS_ObjectIdGetByName/OS_ObjectIdRelease/OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl calls (these are OS-specific APIs, not standard <string.h> calls, and their implementations are outside the shown code), bitwise flag checks and assignments, the conditional checks on filesys->system_mountpt[0], comment text, and ordinary integer/enum return handling. These do not by themselves perform string operations that could access beyond object bounds and therefore do not require investigation under this rule."
