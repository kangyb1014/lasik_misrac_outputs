  "explanation": "The only controlling constructs in this function are the two if statements and the do-while loop; these are the relevant places to check for potentially invariant controlling expressions under Rule 14.3. Other parts of the function (variable declarations, the calls to clock_gettime and arithmetic modifications to sleep_end, the assignments to sleep_end fields, and the return statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore do not fall under Rule 14.3 and need not be investigated for invariant controlling expressions. The listed fragments should be examined to ensure their controlling expressions are not invariant (and to verify whether any allowable exceptions apply)."
