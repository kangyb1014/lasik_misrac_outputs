  "explanation": "I could not find any code that is clearly dead (i.e. always executed but removable without changing program behaviour). Each assignment and operation in the provided functions is used in a subsequent test or has an observable effect in at least some execution paths:\n\n- OS_TaskDelay_Impl(): The timespec is computed and normalized before calling clock_nanosleep(). The do/while loop retries when clock_nanosleep returns EINTR, which is the documented retry condition for interruptible sleeps on POSIX-like systems. The final if/else returns distinct status values; although the else could be written without an explicit else (style redundancy), it is not dead code because it is taken on the non-error path.\n\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread(): Variables such as saved_wait_time, spin_cycles, tick_time, timebase->freerun_time, and the timecb adjustments are all used in later logic or in conditional checks. The saved_wait_time capture may not be used on every iteration (e.g. when the inner while is not entered), but it is used in the case where callbacks should be invoked; therefore the assignment is not always removable. The increment of spin_cycles and the single-time debug log are used to implement the intended spin-limiting behavior. The do/while that iterates callbacks uses the cb_token returned by OS_ObjectIdGetById in the loop condition and body; those operations are necessary for the iteration.\n\n- No assignments are overwritten before use in all paths, and there is no obviously unreachable code (unconditional returns, infinite loops, or branches that can never be taken) that would indicate dead code per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nIf you want, I can re-check with additional context such as the definitions of macros and functions (e.g. OS_DEBUG, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, clock_nanosleep semantics on the target platform). Those definitions could reveal platform-specific behaviour that might make some operations effectively dead (for example, if OS_DEBUG is compiled out entirely or clock_nanosleep never returns EINTR on the target)."
