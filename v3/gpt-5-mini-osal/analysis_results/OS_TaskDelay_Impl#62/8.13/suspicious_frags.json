  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this function. Analysis of pointer uses:\n\n- &sleep_end passed to clock_gettime: clock_gettime writes into the provided struct timespec, so sleep_end must be a modifiable object (non-const). Declaring it const would be incorrect.\n\n- &sleep_end passed to clock_nanosleep (the request-time argument): the POSIX prototype takes a const struct timespec * for the request parameter. Passing the address of a mutable local struct to a function that expects a const pointer is allowed (no implicit removal of const qualification occurs), and sleep_end cannot be declared const because it is modified prior to the call. Thus there is no opportunity to make the pointer point to a const-qualified type here.\n\n- NULL passed for the remaining timespec pointer: NULL is a pointer constant; there is no variable to const-qualify.\n\nNo other pointer variables are declared or used in the function. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that appear to violate Rule 8.13 or that should be flagged for further investigation under that rule."
