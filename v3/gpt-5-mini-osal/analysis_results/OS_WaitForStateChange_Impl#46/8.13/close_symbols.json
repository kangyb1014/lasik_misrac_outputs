  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointers in OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl should have been to const-qualified types, the analyzer must know the exact types and prototypes involved and whether the pointed-to objects are modified by callees:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: defines the type of 'impl' and its members (mutex, cond). Needed to see whether those members are objects or pointers and whether they are declared with const qualifiers.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: declaration/type of the global table indexed by idtype. Needed to determine whether the table elements are pointers to const OS_impl_objtype_lock_t or non-const, which affects whether 'impl' could/should be a pointer-to-const.\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: prototype of the cleanup handler pushed with pthread_cleanup_push. Required to know the parameter type it expects (e.g., pthread_mutex_t * or const pthread_mutex_t *) and whether it modifies the mutex \u2014 if it writes, the pointer cannot be const.\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: prototype is needed to see the const-qualification of its parameters (notably the third parameter is typically 'const struct timespec *'). This determines whether the address-of &ts or &impl->mutex/&impl->cond could/should be pointers to const.\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop: macros (or their expanded forms) show how the cleanup routine is invoked and what type is passed as the second argument; needed to confirm whether the passed pointer must be non-const.\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t: underlying types of impl->mutex and impl->cond. Knowing these types and their intended mutability (as used by pthread APIs) is necessary to conclude whether pointers to them could be const.\n- clock_gettime: prototype is required to determine whether it writes into the timespec (its second parameter is typically 'struct timespec *'), which would prevent making the timespec pointer const.\n- struct timespec: definition of the structure used for ts; needed to confirm how ts is used/modified (tv_sec/tv_nsec updates) and whether passing &ts to functions could be to a const-qualified pointer.\n\nWith these symbols the analyzer can determine which pointers are passed to functions that mutate their targets (and thus cannot be const) and whether any of the pointer declarations could reasonably be const-qualified without breaking API contracts."
