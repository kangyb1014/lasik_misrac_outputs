  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that use compiler language extensions as defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specific points checked and why they are not considered compiler extensions:\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop: These are POSIX pthread macros (library-level), not compiler language extensions. Their use is a POSIX API construct rather than a compiler-specific language extension.\n- pthread_cond_timedwait, pthread_mutex_unlock, clock_gettime, struct timespec, pthread types: These are POSIX APIs and standard POSIX types, not compiler language extensions.\n- Designated initializers in OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (the [INDEX] = value syntax): This is standard C (C99 and later) designated-initializer syntax, not a compiler-specific extension.\n- Use of typedefs (uint32_t / uint32 / osal_objtype_t) and pointer/struct syntax: Standard C language features.\n- Use of the boolean literal false in pthread_cleanup_pop(false): This is standard if stdbool.h is in use; it is not a compiler extension.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions were found (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ( ({ ... }) ), inline assembly, nonstandard storage-class keywords, or other compiler intrinsics). Therefore there are no fragments to flag for Rule 1.2."
