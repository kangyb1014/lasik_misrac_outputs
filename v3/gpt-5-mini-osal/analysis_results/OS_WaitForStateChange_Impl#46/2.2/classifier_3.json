The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl(osal_objtype_t idtype, uint32 attempts)\n{\n    OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl;\n    struct timespec         ts;\n\n    impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];\n\n    /*\n     * because pthread_cond_timedwait() is also a cancellation point,\n     * this pushes a cleanup handler to ensure that if canceled during this call,\n     * the mutex will be released.\n     */\n    pthread_cleanup_push(OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex, &impl->mutex);\n\n    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts);\n\n    if (attempts <= 10)\n    {\n        /* Wait an increasing amount of time, starting at 10ms */\n        ts.tv_nsec += attempts * attempts * 10000000;\n        if (ts.tv_nsec >= 1000000000)\n        {\n            ts.tv_nsec -= 1000000000;\n            ++ts.tv_sec;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* wait 1 second (max for polling) */\n        ++ts.tv_sec;\n    }\n\n    pthread_cond_timedwait(&impl->cond, &impl->mutex, &ts);\n\n    pthread_cleanup_pop(false);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl:\nOS_impl_objtype_lock_t *const OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER] = {\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED]   = NULL,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK]     = &OS_global_task_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_QUEUE]    = &OS_queue_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_COUNTSEM] = &OS_count_sem_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_BINSEM]   = &OS_bin_sem_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MUTEX]    = &OS_mutex_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM]   = &OS_stream_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_DIR]      = &OS_dir_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE] = &OS_timebase_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB]   = &OS_timecb_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE]   = &OS_module_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_FILESYS]  = &OS_filesys_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONSOLE]  = &OS_console_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR]  = &OS_condvar_lock,\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mutex;\n    pthread_cond_t  cond;\n} OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n...\nvoid OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex(void *mut)\n{\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(mut);\n}\n...\nvoid OS_WaitForStateChange(OS_object_token_t *token, uint32 attempts)\n{\n    osal_key_t          saved_unlock_key;\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype;\n\n    /*\n     * This needs to release the lock, to allow other\n     * tasks to make a change to the table.

  "scenario": "The fragment adjusts the absolute timeout used by pthread_cond_timedwait based on the attempts value (adding a quadratic number of nanoseconds for attempts<=10, or adding 1 second otherwise). These operations affect the wait duration and therefore program behaviour. Even though for a specific runtime value (e.g. attempts==0) the addition would be zero, that does not make the code dead because for other values it changes the timeout. No executed operation in this fragment can be removed without potentially changing program behaviour."
