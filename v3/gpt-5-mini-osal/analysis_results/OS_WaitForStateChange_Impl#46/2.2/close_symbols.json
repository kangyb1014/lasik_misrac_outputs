  "explanation": "For a dead-code (removal-without-effect) analysis we must know the definitions and external behaviors that determine whether each statement/branch in OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl can influence program behavior. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - Provides the array/lookup used to compute impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]. Needed to determine whether the assignment and subsequent uses of impl (accessing impl->mutex/cond) are ever effective or could be removed without changing behavior (e.g., if entries are constant, NULL, or unused).\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The struct definition (including fields mutex and cond) is required to know what side-effects accessing impl->mutex/cond has and whether those accesses are meaningful. Also needed to check whether reading those fields has runtime effects (aliases, volatile, etc.).\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex\n  - The cleanup handler pushed with pthread_cleanup_push; its semantics determine whether the push/pop pair (and thus the push call) has any effect on program behavior (e.g., if the handler is non-trivial and required on cancellation). To decide if the push/pop or handler call is dead, the handler body must be known.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop\n  - Their macro/implementation semantics determine what code is generated by the push/pop pair and whether removing them would change behavior (they arrange a cleanup handler for cancellation points). Needed to decide if those calls/statements are removable without effect.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait\n  - The call is central: it is a cancellation point and is the reason the cleanup handler matters, and it also blocks/affects timing. Must know its semantics (cancellation behavior, whether it can be a no-op in this platform) to judge whether the cond wait statement is essential or could be removed without changing observable behavior (timing or synchronization).\n\n- clock_gettime\n  - Used to initialize ts before the timed wait. If clock_gettime never changes state or its result is irrelevant, the call might be removable; conversely if it affects timing/behavior its removal would change behavior. Need its semantics and possible side-effects.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME\n  - The clock id passed to clock_gettime; required to understand timing semantics (wall-clock vs monotonic) and whether the computed timeout actually affects behavior. This affects whether the timeout-calculation branch and the clock_gettime call are meaningful.\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange\n  - The direct caller of the Impl function. Needed to see how attempts and idtype are produced/passed, and whether some code paths or parameter values are impossible, which would make branches in the Impl function dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken\n  - A higher-level caller (from the static call graph). Including callers up the chain is necessary to determine the possible runtime values of idtype and attempts (via call-site analysis), which affects reachability/utility of branches and statements in the Impl function.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The type of idtype; required to determine valid index range into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table and whether certain idtype values (and therefore certain table entries) are ever used \u2014 relevant to whether indexing/assignment is dead.\n\n- uint32\n  - The type of attempts; required to reason about its value range, overflow/wrap semantics in the attempts-based branch, and whether the branch conditions (attempts <= 10 vs > 10) are ever true or are effectively constant (dead branch).\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyst determine: whether the push/pop and cleanup handler are ever invoked (or necessary), whether the timed-wait and clock calls affect observable behavior (timing/synchronization), and whether branches based on attempts or table indexing can ever occur \u2014 which are the facts required to decide if any executed operation in this function could be removed without changing program behavior (i.e., is dead code)."
