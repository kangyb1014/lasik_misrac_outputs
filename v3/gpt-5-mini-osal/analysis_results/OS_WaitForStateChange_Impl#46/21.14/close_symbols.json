  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer needs the following close symbols and why:\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: This function is supplied as the pthread cleanup handler. It may contain calls to memcmp (directly or via wrappers) or manipulate string buffers; its body must be inspected to rule out forbidden memcmp usage reachable from the target function.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Global array used to obtain 'impl'. The definition could involve initializers or accessor logic that use memcmp on strings; its type/contents help determine whether any indirect string comparisons occur.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The structure type of *impl. Its members (e.g., any char arrays, pointers, or embedded helper functions/macros) must be checked to ensure no memcmp-on-NT-strings occurs in operations on those members or in any inline functions/macros operating on them.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop: These are typically macros/ABI constructs that expand into code; their definitions must be inspected to ensure they do not expand into any code that uses memcmp on null-terminated strings in this context.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: The POSIX call made here is an external function; while the standard implementation will not use memcmp on user strings, custom or wrapper implementations could. Include its symbol if project-specific implementations or wrappers exist.\n\n- clock_gettime and CLOCK_REALTIME: These are used to set the timeout. Their declarations/definitions (or wrappers) should be checked to ensure no hidden string comparisons occur in project-specific wrappers.\n\n- struct timespec: The layout and member types are needed to verify that the code's manipulation of ts (tv_sec/tv_nsec) does not depend on or invoke any string comparison helpers or macros that might use memcmp.\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange: The immediate caller is included so the analyzer can inspect call-site context (wrappers, inline functions, or macros) that might alter behavior or introduce memcmp uses related to this wait operation.\n\n- osal_objtype_t and uint32: The typedefs for the parameter types. If these are project-defined types (e.g., enums implemented as structures or with associated inline helper functions/macros), those definitions must be checked for any memcmp usage.\n\nIn short, the listed symbols cover the cleanup handler, the data structures referenced, the threading/time APIs/macros used, and the immediate caller/parameter types. Inspecting these symbols ensures there is no indirect or macro-expanded use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings reachable from OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl."
