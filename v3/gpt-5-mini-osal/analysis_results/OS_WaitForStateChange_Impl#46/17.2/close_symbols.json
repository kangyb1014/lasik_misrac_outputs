  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the functions that call it and any functions it calls that could call back into it.  - OS_WaitForStateChange: the immediate caller shown in the call graph. Its body must be inspected to see whether it (or any functions it calls) eventually calls OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl (directly or via another chain).  - OS_ObjectIdConvertToken: the caller of OS_WaitForStateChange (per the call graph). Its body and transitive callees must be checked for any path that returns to OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl, completing an indirect recursion cycle.  - OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: pushed as a cleanup handler; although unlikely, the cleanup function could call back into OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl (or other OS public APIs that do), so its implementation should be inspected.  - clock_gettime: a callee of the target; include to confirm it does not call back into application-level functions that could lead to recursion.  - pthread_cond_timedwait: a callee of the target; include to confirm the pthread implementation (or any user-provided wrappers) does not call back into application code forming a cycle.  - pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop: the push/pop usage registers a cleanup handler (OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex); include them to understand the cleanup semantics and to ensure the cleanup invocation cannot produce a call chain back to OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl.  In short: inspect the implementations of the listed symbols (and any further transitive callees they reference) to detect any cycle that would cause OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl to call itself directly or indirectly."
