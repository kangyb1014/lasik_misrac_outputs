  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no direct or indirect recursive calls in the provided code fragments. Reasoning:\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: calls clock_gettime and pthread_cond_timedwait and registers a cleanup handler via pthread_cleanup_push. It does not call OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl itself, nor any other function in the snippet that would call it back.\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange: calls OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl but is not called by OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl, so there is no direct recursion. OS_WaitForStateChange also does not call itself or any function that would call it back.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken: calls OS_WaitForStateChange (which calls OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl). None of these functions call OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, so there is no indirect recursion involving this function.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: the cleanup handler only calls pthread_mutex_unlock and does not call any of the other functions; registering it with pthread_cleanup_push does not introduce a static call from any of the listed functions back into themselves.\n\n- pthread APIs used (clock_gettime, pthread_cond_timedwait, pthread_cleanup_push/pop) do not invoke user callbacks that would cause the shown functions to be called recursively in the static call graph.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls)."
