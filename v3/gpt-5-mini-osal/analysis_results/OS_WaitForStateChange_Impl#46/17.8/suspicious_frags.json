  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter (either OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl's parameters idtype and attempts, or OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex's parameter mut). Specifically:\n- idtype is only used to index OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] (read-only). There is no assignment to idtype, no increment/decrement, and its address is not taken.\n- attempts is only read in the conditional and arithmetic expression (attempts * attempts * 10000000). There is no assignment to attempts, no use of ++/--, and its address is not taken.\n- The pointer parameter mut in OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex is only forwarded to pthread_mutex_unlock(mut) and is not assigned or modified.\n- No other function in the provided fragments takes a pointer parameter that is reassigned inside the function.\nTherefore, there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
