  "explanation": "For checking MISRA\u2011C unreachable\u2011code in OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl you need symbols that affect whether the function (and each branch inside it) can actually be reached or whether some lines are made unreachable by types/macros/ callers or by out\u2011of\u2011range/constant values: \n\n- osal_objtype_t: to determine valid ranges/values for the idtype index into the global table (important for determining whether impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] is ever executed or if some indices are impossible). \n- uint32: to know the value range and signedness of attempts (the if (attempts <= 10) branch reachability depends on this type). \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: to see the layout (mutex/cond members) and whether accessing impl->mutex/cond is well\u2011formed; also helps detect if impl can be NULL or a sentinel making code undefined rather than reachable. \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (declaration/definition including size): to determine table length and whether indexing by idtype can be out of range or idtype values are limited such that some paths are never taken. \n- OS_WaitForStateChange: the direct caller \u2014 you must inspect how it invokes OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl and what arguments it passes (especially attempts and idtype) to decide if branches in the callee are reachable. \n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken: caller of the caller shown in the static call graph; needed to see the full call chain and possible argument values that propagate to attempts/idtype (to decide overall reachability from program entry points). \n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: the cleanup handler symbol used in pthread_cleanup_push; inspect its behavior only if it can affect control flow (non\u2011returning or longjmp) which would change reachability assumptions. \n- pthread_cleanup_push (macro) and pthread_cleanup_pop (macro): these are macros that affect control\u2011flow structure (they expand into code that must be balanced). Their expansion could introduce blocks/labels that affect reachability analysis (and must be checked to ensure no accidental unreachable code is produced). \n- pthread_cond_timedwait: library call that blocks but returns; verify it is not a non\u2011returning call in this build (if a platform replaced it with a noreturn wrapper it would affect reachability). \n- clock_gettime and CLOCK_REALTIME: ensure clock_gettime is not mapped to a non\u2011returning call or macro that changes control flow; also needed to know if ts initialization could be constant and make some arithmetic branch behavior predictable. \n- struct timespec: to verify tv_nsec/tv_sec types and any overflow semantics that could make the arithmetic/conditional behaviour constant/unreachable. \n- false (stdbool.h or project definition): the value passed to pthread_cleanup_pop affects whether the cleanup handler is executed immediately; also need its definition to ensure it is the standard 0 (no side effects) and not a macro with control flow consequences.\n\nCollecting these symbols (and their definitions/implementations) lets the next analyzer determine: (a) whether OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl is reachable from program entry points, (b) whether the attempts/idtype values make either branch of the attempts <= 10 test impossible, and (c) whether any macros or called functions are non\u2011returning or otherwise alter control flow such that code in this function becomes unreachable."
