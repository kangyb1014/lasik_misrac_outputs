  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (definition/initializer and any functions that modify it): The controlling expression if (impl != NULL) depends directly on the value read from this global array. To decide if the condition is invariant you must know the array\u2019s declaration, initial values, storage class (const/volatile), and any code that writes to its entries.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The type of the array elements; its declaration can include qualifiers (e.g. volatile) or semantics that affect whether the pointer value can change or be treated as constant for analysis.\n- osal_objtype_t: The type and possible range of idtype determine which index into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table is used; if idtype is constrained to a single value at call sites the condition may be invariant.\n- OS_Unlock_Global: Immediate caller \u2014 you must inspect how it computes/passes idtype to see whether the indexed element is variable or constant across calls to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry: These are callers of OS_Unlock_Global (from the static call graph). To determine whether idtype (and thus impl) can take multiple values at runtime, you need to examine these call paths to see what idtype values they pass (or whether they are constant), which affects whether the controlling expression can be invariant.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the global table and its init/modifiers, the element type, the idtype type, the caller and upstream callers) provides the necessary information to determine if the if (impl != NULL) test is effectively invariant and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
