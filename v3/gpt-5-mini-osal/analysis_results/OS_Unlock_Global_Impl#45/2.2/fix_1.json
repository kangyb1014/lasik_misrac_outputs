  "explanation": "The original compile error was due to missing type and symbol definitions required by the translation unit. I added the necessary #includes, provided a concrete typedef for osal_objtype_t, defined OS_impl_objtype_lock_t (and its struct), and declared a static OS_impl_objtype_lock_table array so indexing is valid. I also added a bounds check for idtype before indexing the table. No macros, no main, and original OS_Unlock_Global_Impl logic was preserved as closely as possible; logging and error handling behavior remain the same."
