The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(osal_objtype_t idtype)\n{\n    OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl;\n    int                     ret;\n\n    impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Notify any waiting threads that the state _may_ have changed */\n        ret = pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond): %s\", strerror(ret));\n            /* unexpected but keep going (not critical) */\n        }\n\n        ret = pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mutex);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mutex): %s\", strerror(ret));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Unlock_Global_Impl:\nOS_impl_objtype_lock_t *const OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER] = {\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED]   = NULL,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK]     = &OS_global_task_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_QUEUE]    = &OS_queue_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_COUNTSEM] = &OS_count_sem_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_BINSEM]   = &OS_bin_sem_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MUTEX]    = &OS_mutex_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM]   = &OS_stream_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_DIR]      = &OS_dir_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE] = &OS_timebase_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB]   = &OS_timecb_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE]   = &OS_module_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_FILESYS]  = &OS_filesys_table_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONSOLE]  = &OS_console_lock,\n    [OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR]  = &OS_condvar_lock,\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mutex;\n    pthread_cond_t  cond;\n} OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_objtype_t\n...\nvoid OS_Unlock_Global(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype;\n\n    if (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];\n\n        /*\n         * Un-track ownership of this table.
