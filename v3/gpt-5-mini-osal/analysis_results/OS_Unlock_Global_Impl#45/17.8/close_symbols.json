  "explanation": "- osal_objtype_t: defines the type of the parameter idtype. Needed to determine whether idtype is a scalar/enum/pointer (MISRA forbids modifying a parameter value; pointer targets may be modified but the pointer itself must not be reassigned).\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: the expression OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] is the only use of idtype in the function. You must inspect this symbol's declaration/definition to ensure it is an array/index expression (no side\u2011effecting macro or accessor that could modify idtype).\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: the type of impl (and of impl->cond/impl->mutex). Needed to confirm that the function only dereferences/modifies the pointed\u2011to object (allowed for pointer targets) and that no pointer reassignment to a parameter occurs indirectly.\n- OS_DEBUG: this macro/function is invoked with formatting and could be a macro that expands in a way that references/modifies idtype; include its definition to rule out hidden parameter modification.\n- pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock: these called library functions are passed members of *impl; include their prototypes to confirm they do not use idtype or perform hidden actions on parameters in this context.\n- strerror: included because it is called in the error path; include its declaration in case any macros/wrappers are used that could affect parameters.\n- OS_Unlock_Global: the caller of this implementation. Include its declaration/definition to see how idtype is passed into OS_Unlock_Global_Impl (e.g., if caller uses macros or expressions with side effects when forwarding the argument)."
