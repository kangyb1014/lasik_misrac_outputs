  "explanation": "strerror \u2014 Declared in <string.h>; include to verify its signature/semantics (it takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal/static string rather than copying into a caller buffer). This shows there is no direct use of the listed risky functions (memcpy/strcpy/strncpy/...).\n\nOS_DEBUG \u2014 Macro/function used to log the strerror result. Must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not internally use any of the <string.h> functions (strcpy/strncpy/etc.) in a way that could access beyond buffer bounds when formatting the \"%s\" argument.\n\nOS_impl_objtype_lock_table \u2014 Global table indexed by idtype; include to confirm index range/validity and that impl can be NULL or valid. If indexing could be out-of-range it might lead to invalid memory and subsequent calls that use strings could be affected.\n\nOS_impl_objtype_lock_t \u2014 Type of the table entries; needed to confirm that members used (cond and mutex) are of the expected types and that no embedded char buffers or string operations are invoked via these members.\n\npthread_cond_broadcast \u2014 POSIX call used here; include to confirm it has no use of <string.h> functions that could cause out-of-bounds accesses relevant to this rule (and to document that it does not take pointer-to-char parameters).\n\npthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 POSIX call used here; include to confirm it does not invoke any <string.h> functions that would violate the rule.\n\npthread_cond_t and pthread_mutex_t \u2014 Types of impl->cond and impl->mutex; include to ensure these members are not wrappers around structures that perform string operations or contain character buffers that could be misused.\n\nosal_objtype_t \u2014 Type of idtype used to index OS_impl_objtype_lock_table; include to verify valid value range and whether invalid values could cause out-of-bounds indexing into the table (which could lead to accesses of unrelated memory and potential string-function misuse).\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule targets use of standard string.h functions that take pointer parameters. The only string-related symbol in the function is strerror and the OS_DEBUG logging call. To establish there is no violation, the analyzer must see the declarations/semantics of strerror, the implementation of OS_DEBUG (to check for unsafe string.h usage), and ensure that table indexing (OS_impl_objtype_lock_table and osal_objtype_t) cannot produce invalid impl pointers that might lead to subsequent unsafe string operations. The pthread symbols and mutex/cond types are included to rule out indirect string handling inside synchronization primitives or their wrappers."
