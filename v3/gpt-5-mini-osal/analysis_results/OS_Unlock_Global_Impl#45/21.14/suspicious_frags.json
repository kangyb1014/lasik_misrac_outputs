  "explanation": "I examined the provided function OS_Unlock_Global_Impl and the related definitions. There is no use of the Standard Library function memcmp anywhere in the shown code. The function only calls pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock, and strerror (and the OS_DEBUG macro expands to nothing here). None of these are memcmp and there are no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp in the supplied fragments. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you have additional source files or other code fragments that were not provided, please supply them so I can check for any memcmp usage comparing null-terminated strings."
