  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Unlock_Global_Impl violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp for null-terminated string comparison, the analyzer must inspect any symbols called or referenced by this function that might themselves call or use memcmp or perform string comparisons.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Usually a macro or function that formats/logs strings; it could contain memcmp or other string-comparison logic. Inspecting its definition is required to ensure no memcmp-based string comparisons occur.\n- strerror: Returns a C string; its implementation (or wrappers) might use memcmp internally in some environments. Include to check indirect use of memcmp or other string-comparison behaviour.\n- pthread_cond_broadcast: A calle\u00e9 in this function. While unlikely to compare strings, its implementation should be checked for any memcmp usage only if a full call-tree audit is required.\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: Same rationale as pthread_cond_broadcast \u2014 include to ensure no indirect memcmp usage inside thread library calls used here.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Global array referenced by the function. Inspect its type and contents to ensure the code is not indexing into or treating string objects in a way that would trigger memcmp-based comparisons.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct type of table entries; its definition (fields cond and mutex) must be checked to ensure these are synchronization objects (not strings) and that no hidden string comparisons occur when accessing them.\n- osal_objtype_t: The index/type used to index the table; include to verify it cannot be a string or a wrapper that triggers string comparison behavior.\n- pthread_cond_t and pthread_mutex_t: The concrete types of impl->cond and impl->mutex; include to confirm they are synchronization primitives and not some typedef to string-handling types.\n- memcmp: The symbol specified by the MISRA rule \u2014 include to check directly for any uses in this function or in any of the above symbols' implementations.\n\nInspecting these symbols (definitions/implementations/macros) is sufficient to conclude whether OS_Unlock_Global_Impl or any code it directly invokes performs memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings."
