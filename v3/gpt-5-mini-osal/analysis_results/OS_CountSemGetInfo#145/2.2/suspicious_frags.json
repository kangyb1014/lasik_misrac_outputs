  "explanation": "I have reported all statements in OS_CountSemGetInfo that could plausibly be dead (executed but removable without changing observable behaviour) and therefore warrant investigation. The other fragments were not reported because they are not executable operations that could be dead, or they have obvious side effects or control-flow impact that make them unlikely to be dead code: - Declarations (OS_common_record_t *record; OS_object_token_t token; int32 return_code;) are not executable statements and thus not applicable for Rule 2.2. - The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById(...) is a transaction/lookup routine with side effects (initializes token, may lock or unlock global state); removing it would clearly change behaviour. - The conditional if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) and the final return return_code; affect control flow and return value and therefore are not dead. - The use of record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is an access to the object table based on the token produced by OS_ObjectIdGetById; it is part of the observable behaviour. - The surrounding function signature and braces are structural and not candidates for dead-code removal. These omitted fragments therefore do not need investigation under Rule 2.2, while the listed suspicious statements should be examined to determine whether they are truly necessary or constitute dead code."
