  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code contains only standard C constructs and POSIX API calls: declarations, pointer dereference, function calls (OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, sem_timedwait), use of errno and ETIMEDOUT, and a macro invocation (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET). There are no visible compiler-specific extension tokens or constructs such as identifiers beginning with double underscores, __attribute__, __asm__, inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, typeof, __builtin_\u2026 intrinsics, nested functions, __extension__, _Pragma with compiler-specific pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions. The only macro invocation (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) could in principle expand to something that uses an extension, but its definition is not present in this snippet \u2014 therefore the call itself is not evidence of a language extension in the shown code. For these reasons there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
