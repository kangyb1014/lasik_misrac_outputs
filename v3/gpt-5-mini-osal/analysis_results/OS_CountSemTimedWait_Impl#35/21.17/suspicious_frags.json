  "explanation": "No occurrences of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code. The function body only uses: - OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(&ts) \u2014 computes an absolute timespec (not a string operation). - sem_timedwait(&impl->id, &ts) \u2014 a POSIX semaphore wait (not from <string.h>). - errno and ETIMEDOUT handling \u2014 error/status checks (not string operations). - OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) and the array OS_impl_count_sem_table \u2014 table/macro access; the macro expansion is not shown but the use here is not a string.h call. There are no calls to standard string-handling functions, nor any obvious buffer/character-array manipulations in the shown code. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation specifically for Rule 21.17. (If callers or any of the referenced helper functions/macros \u2014 e.g., OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime or the expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET \u2014 internally call string.h functions, those implementations would need to be inspected separately, but they are not part of the provided code.)"
