  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning:\n\n- The function parameters are: const OS_object_token_t *token and uint32 msecs. There is no assignment to either parameter (no occurrences of token = ... or msecs = ...).\n- Dereferencing the pointer parameter (*token) in the call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) only reads the object; it does not modify the pointer itself. Moreover, token is a pointer to const, so *token is a const lvalue and cannot be modified without a compile-time error.\n- msecs is passed by value to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts); passing by value cannot modify the caller's variable.\n- sem_timedwait is called with &impl->id and &ts (addresses of local objects), not with the address of a parameter pointer, so it cannot modify the pointer parameter.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that modify a function parameter or the pointer value, and nothing that indicates a potential Rule 17.8 violation."
