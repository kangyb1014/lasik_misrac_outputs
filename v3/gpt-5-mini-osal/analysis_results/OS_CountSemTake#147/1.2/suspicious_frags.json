  "explanation": "No language extensions detected. The function uses standard C constructs: a normal function definition, local variable declarations, a call to OS_ObjectIdGetById, a conditional if, and a return statement. The typedefs shown (int32_t aliased as int32, uint32 as osal_id_t, and an opaque struct type) are ordinary typedefs, not compiler extensions. The macro definition (#define OS_SUCCESS (0)) and the comment style (/* ... */) are standard preprocessor and comment usage. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs (for example no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, anonymous struct/union extensions, pragmas beyond standard, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 1.2."
