  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointers to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer usages are the two occurrences passing &token to other routines. No other pointer variables or pointer parameters appear in the code (sem_id is not a pointer, return_code and token are plain non-pointer objects, and there are no pointer casts). Therefore only the two calls that pass the address of 'token' need investigation to determine whether the receiving functions could/should accept a pointer to a const-qualified type. No other fragments in this function are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
