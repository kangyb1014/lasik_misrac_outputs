  "explanation": "No code fragment in OS_SocketConnect_Impl modifies any of the function parameters. Details:\n- token: only dereferenced (*token) and passed by value to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and passed as an argument to OS_SelectSingle_Impl. There is no assignment to token itself (no \"token = ...\"), no taking of &token, and the dereference is only used to index the table. Thus the pointer parameter is not modified.\n- Addr: only read (Addr->AddrData, Addr->ActualLength) and its address-of is taken to form a local const struct sockaddr *sa via a cast. There is no assignment to Addr (no \"Addr = ...\") and the object pointed to is not modified (and the parameter is declared const), so the rule is satisfied.\n- timeout: passed by value to OS_SelectSingle_Impl and not assigned to within the function (no \"timeout = ...\").\n- All assignments in the function are to local variables (return_code, os_status, sockopt, slen, operation, sa, impl) and to no parameter.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
