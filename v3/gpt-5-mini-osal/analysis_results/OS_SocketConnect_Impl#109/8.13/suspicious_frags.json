  "explanation": "Other pointer-related fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameters token and Addr are already pointers to const-qualified types; the local pointer sa is declared as const struct sockaddr * and is assigned from the const Addr->AddrData (with an explicit const cast), so it already points to a const-qualified type; the &sockopt and &slen arguments to getsockopt must be non-const because getsockopt writes output into those locations; the &operation passed to OS_SelectSingle_Impl also must be modifiable by that API, so it cannot be const; standard socket APIs (connect, getsockopt) require the shown signatures (connect takes a const struct sockaddr *, getsockopt takes a non-const buffer), so their usages (aside from the impl pointer) are appropriate. Therefore only the uses of the impl pointer (declaration, assignment, and subsequent accesses) are potential candidates for const-qualification and should be investigated."
