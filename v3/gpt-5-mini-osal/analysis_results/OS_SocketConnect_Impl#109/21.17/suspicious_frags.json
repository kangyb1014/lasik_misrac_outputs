  "explanation": "No other code fragments call functions from <string.h> that take user-supplied buffer pointers (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The other library calls in this function are socket APIs (connect, select wrapper, getsockopt) and do not invoke the string handling functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only use of a string-related library function in this function is strerror(), which does not accept a caller-provided buffer pointer (it returns a pointer to an internal static string). Therefore no further fragments in this function need investigation under Rule 21.17."
