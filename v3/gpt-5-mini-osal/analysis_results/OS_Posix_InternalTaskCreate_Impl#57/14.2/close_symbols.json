There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For a MISRA check that a for loop is well-formed we must inspect not only explicit for-statements in this function but also any symbols that can (a) expand to hidden loops (macros/inline), (b) are called from within loops (their behaviour is part of the loop body), or (c) supply objects/flags that could be used as loop counters/control flags. Each listed symbol is required for the reasons below:\n\n- OS_PriorityRemap: This is an internal function called here. Its implementation may contain for-loops or modify global/state objects that could serve as loop counters/controls; MISRA requires analysing called functions when reasoning about loop body behaviour.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (and its fields PageSize, EnableTaskPriorities, SelectedRtScheduler): These globals are read in expressions that could be used as loop bounds/controls in this or related code. The fields might be macros, volatile, or have accessor semantics; their definitions must be checked to ensure no hidden side-effects or aliasing that would violate the rule (e.g. if reading them invokes code that modifies loop counters).\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Usually a macro; macros can expand to complex code including loops or statements that alter variables. Its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not introduce loops or modify loop counters/flags when used in this function.\n\n- strerror: Called inside debug/error reporting. Although a standard library function, its implementation or macro wrapper should be checked if it could have side-effects relevant when reasoning about loops inside this function (per MISRA, functions called inside loop clauses/bodies are part of the loop behaviour).\n\n- PTHREAD_STACK_MIN: A macro/constant used to adjust stacksz. If it is a macro with side-effects (rare but possible in some environments) it must be inspected to ensure it does not introduce hidden loops or modifications.\n\n- PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED: These macros/constants are used in attribute-setting calls. If they are defined in a way that expands to expressions or functions, they must be checked for hidden loops/side-effects.\n\n- pthread_attr_* family and pthread_create / pthread_attr_destroy: These functions are invoked from this function. Per MISRA, the behaviour of functions called within a for statement is considered part of the loop body; even though this function has no explicit for, these callees could be inline or macros that contain loops or modify objects that might be used as loop counters elsewhere. Their definitions/headers must be checked for hidden loops or side-effects.\n\n- memset: Standard library function but sometimes defined as a macro/inline; must be checked for any non-obvious behaviour (e.g. macros expanding to loops) that could affect loop analysis.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: Return-code macros/constants used by this function. Their definitions should be checked to ensure they are simple constants and not complex expressions/macros that could expand to code with loops/side-effects.\n\n- pthread_attr_t, pthread_t, struct sched_param, PthreadFuncPtr_t: Type definitions matter when analysing whether variables used in loop clauses are single identifiers (loop counters) and whether aliasing or side-effects may occur. For example, if any of these types are implemented via macros or inline wrappers that hide operations, they must be inspected.\n\nOverall rationale: to determine compliance with the MISRA requirement for well-formed for-loops you must examine any symbol that can (1) expand to or contain a for-loop (macros, inline functions), (2) be called from within a for-clause/body (their behaviour becomes part of the loop), or (3) supply or modify objects that could be used as loop counters/flags. The symbols above cover all macros, globals, types and functions referenced in the target function that could affect that analysis."
