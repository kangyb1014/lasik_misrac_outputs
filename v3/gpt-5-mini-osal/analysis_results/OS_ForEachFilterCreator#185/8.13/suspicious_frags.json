  "explanation": "The other symbols in the provided code do not involve pointers that could reasonably be const-qualified: token and obj parameters are already declared const; OS_ObjectIdEqual and OS_ObjectIdIsValid operate on value types (osal_id_t/osal_objtype_t), not pointer types; macro definitions are not pointer declarations. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
