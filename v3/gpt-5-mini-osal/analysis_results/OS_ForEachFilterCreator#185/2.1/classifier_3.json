  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment OS_ObjectIdIsValid(obj->active_id) appears inside the return expression of a function and is evaluated at runtime (subject to normal short\u2011circuit semantics). It is therefore reachable; it would only be unreachable if it were located after an unconditional return, within code excluded by conditional compilation (e.g. #if 0), or otherwise placed inside a block that can never be entered."
