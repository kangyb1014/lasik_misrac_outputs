  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the expression OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) is a runtime boolean test used in a short\u2011circuited logical OR. The second operand (OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id)) can still be executed when the first operand is false, so there is no statically unreachable code. (MISRA 2.1 would only be violated here if OS_ObjectIdEqual were a compile\u2011time constant that made the second call impossible to reach, which is not indicated by the fragment.)"
