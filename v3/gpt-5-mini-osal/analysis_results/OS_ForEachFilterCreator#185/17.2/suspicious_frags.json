  "explanation": "I selected the three function definitions shown and the calls to OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl and OS_ObjectIdToInteger because indirect recursion (Rule 17.2) can occur via helper functions called from OS_ForEachFilterCreator. These fragments therefore must be investigated to ensure none of the called helpers (including OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl and OS_ObjectIdToInteger or functions they call) call back to OS_ForEachFilterCreator (directly or indirectly).\n\nOther parts of the code need not be investigated based on the provided snippets because:\n- The boolean expression inside OS_ForEachFilterCreator consists only of logical operators and equality checks; the only function invocations in that expression are OS_ObjectIdIsValid and OS_ObjectIdEqual, which are already included for inspection.\n- There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other invocation sites visible in the provided fragments that could form an indirect call chain beyond the listed helper calls.\n- Macros/constants (e.g., OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) and simple assignments (OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref) cannot introduce recursion by themselves.\n\nTo fully verify compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2, the definitions (or call graphs) of OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl and OS_ObjectIdToInteger (and any functions they call) must be examined; these are listed above as suspicious because their implementations were not provided."
