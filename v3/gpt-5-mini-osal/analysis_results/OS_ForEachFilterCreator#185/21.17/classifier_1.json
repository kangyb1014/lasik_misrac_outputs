  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the call OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id) itself does not invoke any <string.h> functions. A violation would only occur if the implementation of OS_ObjectIdEqual used standard string-handling functions on obj->creator or filter->creator_id in a way that can read/write past their bounds. For example, if obj->creator is a fixed-size non-NUL-terminated array and OS_ObjectIdEqual used strcmp(obj->creator, filter->creator_id) or memcpy with an incorrect length, that would read beyond the object and violate MISRA Rule 21.17."
