  "explanation": "- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: must analyze its implementation or macro expansion to know whether it can be constant (invariant) for all inputs or depends on obj->active_id at run time. If it's a macro/constant stub it could make the whole && branch invariant.\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual: must inspect its implementation/macro to determine whether comparing IDs can ever vary at run time or is compiled to a constant expression (or always returns true/false), which affects whether the || sub-expression is invariant.\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY: the constant value (macro/enum) is used in OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY). Its value or definition could make that comparison always true/false; need to know its definition to decide invariance.\n- OS_creator_filter_t: the struct definition is required to know the type and mutability of filter->creator_id (its type, whether it can change at run time, and whether it might equal OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY by construction).\n- OS_common_record_t: the struct definition is required to know the types of obj->active_id and obj->creator (their types, ranges, and whether they can vary), which affects whether the calls using them can be invariant.\n- OS_object_id_t: (or the actual typedef used for active_id/creator/creator_id) the underlying ID type and any associated constants/macros are needed to determine whether validity/equality checks can be resolved as compile-time invariants.\n\nProviding these symbols (implementations/macros and type/constant definitions) lets the analyser determine if any part of the controlling expression is a compile-time or semantic invariant and therefore whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
