The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\n```c\nbool OS_ForEachFilterCreator(void *ref, const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj)\n{\n    OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref;\n\n    /*\n     * Check if the obj_id is both valid and matches\n     * the specified creator_id\n     */\n    return (OS_ObjectIdIsValid(obj->active_id) && (OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) ||\n                                                   OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id)));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdIsValid(osal_id_t object_id)\n{\n    osal_objtype_t objtype = OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(object_id);\n    return (objtype > OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED && objtype < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER);\n}\n...\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdEqual(osal_id_t object_id1, osal_id_t object_id2)\n{\n    return (OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id1) == OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id2));\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    osal_id_t        creator_id;\n    OS_ArgCallback_t user_callback;\n    void *           user_arg;\n} OS_creator_filter_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_common_record OS_common_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a preprocessor macro that defines an alias (OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY \u2192 OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED). MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 applies to runtime operations that are executed but removable without affecting behaviour (dead code). A macro definition is not an executed operation, so it cannot be classified as dead code under this rule. (If the macro were unused it would be an unused definition, not a runtime dead-code violation. A concrete Rule 2.2 violation example would be a function call or assignment that is executed at runtime but removing it does not alter program behaviour, e.g. assigning to a variable that is never read and has no side effects.)"
