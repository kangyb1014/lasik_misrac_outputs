  "explanation": "Other code fragments were reviewed and are not reported because they do not on their face indicate unreachable code (Rule 2.1) and are conditional or normal control flow that can be reached at runtime:\n\n- The objtype check and early return in OS_TimeBaseGetIdByName (the if (objtype == OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE) { return ...; }) is a legitimate runtime conditional return, not statically unreachable.\n\n- The call and subsequent conditional in OS_ObjectIdFindByName (return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(...); if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) { *object_id = token.obj_id; OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token); }) are normal conditional code paths that depend on runtime return_code and therefore are reachable.\n\n- The inline OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl and OS_TaskGetId_Impl implementations are simple operations (shift of an id and read of thread-specific storage via a union wrapper) and do not contain statically unreachable code.\n\n- The macro OS_CHECK_APINAME is included above as suspicious because it enforces non-NULL/length checks at the caller site; beyond that, its presence alone is expected and not by itself proof of unreachable code except in combination with the comment/ARGCHECK in OS_ObjectIdFindByName (which is why that combination was reported).\n\nThe reported fragments focus on places where the source text contains an apparent contradiction (a comment asserting NULL is allowed followed immediately by ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK that would reject NULL) and on the caller-side API-name check and pointer-check macro that create enforcement points which may render the NULL-name path impossible in practice. These are the locations that should be investigated further for potential unreachable code or contradictory contract assumptions."
