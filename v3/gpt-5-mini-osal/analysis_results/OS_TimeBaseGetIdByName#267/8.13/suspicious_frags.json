  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages were found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the provided code. All pointer parameters that are used read-only are already const-qualified, and pointers that are non-const are clearly used for output or mutation and therefore must not be const:\n\n- OS_TimeBaseGetIdByName(osal_id_t *timer_id, const char *timebase_name): timebase_name is const char * (read-only); timer_id is an output parameter (assigned via OS_ObjectIdFindByName) so must be non-const.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFindByName(osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, osal_id_t *object_id): name is const char * (read-only checks via ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK); object_id is assigned (*object_id = token.obj_id) so is correctly non-const as an output parameter.\n\n- Calls to OS_ObjectIdGetByName(..., name, &token) and OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) operate on token as an output/handle and/or are expected to modify or release it, so the pointers involved must remain non-const.\n\n- The macros used (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_APINAME, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) perform checks and do not imply the underlying pointer types should be const; where the macros accept strings they are already const-qualified in the function signatures.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer declarations or parameters in the provided fragments that could or should be changed to point to a const-qualified type without breaking intended behavior."
