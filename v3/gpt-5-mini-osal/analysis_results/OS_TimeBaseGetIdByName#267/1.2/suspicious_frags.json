  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related symbols for use of compiler-specific language extensions. No suspicious fragments were found. Specifically:\n\n- There are no occurrences of compiler-extension keywords or builtins such as __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __asm, __typeof__, statement-expression GCC ({ ... }), nested functions, label-as-value (&&label), or other non-standard GCC/Clang/MSVC keywords.\n- No use of inline assembly or pragmas that are compiler-specific (e.g., #pragma GCC, #pragma pack) appears in the shown code.\n- The use of `static inline` is standard C (C99 and later) and not a compiler extension by itself.\n- The pthreads call (pthread_getspecific) and the cppcheck comment are library/analysis items, not compiler language extensions.\n- Macros shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_APINAME, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) expand to checks but their visible definitions do not reveal any compiler-extension constructs; there is no evidence in the provided expansions that they rely on compiler-specific features.\n- Union-based value access (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t usage) and bit-shifting/typedefs are standard C, not extensions.\n\nIf there are other macro definitions (e.g., BUGCHECK, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_ObjectIdGetByName) or portions of the codebase that were not provided and that use compiler-specific builtins or attributes, those should be submitted for review. Based on the code fragments shown, there are no explicit compiler language extensions to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
