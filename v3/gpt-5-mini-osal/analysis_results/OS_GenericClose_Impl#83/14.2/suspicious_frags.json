First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in OS_GenericClose_Impl or in the provided related definitions. I checked the used macros and inline function: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array index expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) and contains no for; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a simple inline accessor that returns token->obj_idx and contains no for; OS_impl_filehandle_table is an array declaration (no for); OS_DEBUG expands to nothing; the function body of OS_GenericClose_Impl itself contains only a call to close(), an if, assignments and returns \u2014 no for. Because there are no for statements in the target function or the shown related code fragments, there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (a for loop shall be well-formed). If there are other inline functions or macros not provided here that expand into for statements, those would need to be supplied for review; based on the supplied code, nothing is suspicious with respect to Rule 14.2."
