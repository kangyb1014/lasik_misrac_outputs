  "explanation": "The if (result < 0) block and the OS_DEBUG invocation should be investigated because the debug macro is defined empty in the provided additional code; that configuration can result in the logging statement being removed or the branch becoming a no-op in some build configurations \u2014 this may hide code that is effectively never executed in the produced binary. The macro definition itself is included because different macro definitions across build configurations can produce reachable vs unreachable code in the final build. The assignment from the object table macro is included because the macro signature takes the address of its token parameter (\"&(tok)\"), and passing \"*token\" into that macro can have subtle effects across different translations or macro definitions; it should be checked that this expansion cannot result in a never-executed or ill-formed access in some build configurations.\n\nOther lines in the function do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code): the call to close(impl->fd) is an actual system call and its return controls the conditional branch; impl->fd = -1 is executed unconditionally after the conditional and is reachable; the final return OS_SUCCESS is the required function exit and reachable; the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and is reachable when the function is called. These items do not exhibit obvious evidence of being unreachable in the provided code/configuration and therefore were not included as suspicious fragments."
