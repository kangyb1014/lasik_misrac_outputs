  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if (result < 0) branch can be taken when close() fails, so the code is potentially reachable. Although OS_DEBUG is defined empty and the branch body becomes empty, that does not make the branch unreachable. A real violation of Rule 2.1 would occur here only if the condition were provably always false (e.g. result is of an unsigned type guaranteed non\u2011negative) or if a macro expansion introduced an unconditional control transfer (e.g. a return/goto) that made subsequent statements unreachable."
