  "explanation": "The remaining code is not suspicious for Rule 2.2: the call result = close(impl->fd); performs a runtime side-effect (closing a file descriptor) and therefore cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. The variable result is used in the subsequent conditional, and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET / OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are used to obtain the impl pointer and thus are required. The final assignment impl->fd = -1 updates the implementation state to reflect a closed handle and therefore affects later behaviour. The return of OS_SUCCESS is the function's intended output. Thus only the listed fragments (the error-handling/logging block and the logging invocation) warrant investigation for potential dead-code issues; the rest of the function contains operations that have observable effects and should not be classified as dead code."
