  "explanation": "The following fragments were NOT reported as suspicious and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter declaration 'int32 OS_GenericClose_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)' \u2014 it already points to a const-qualified type; the inline function 'static inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)' \u2014 it accepts a pointer to const; the use of 'impl->fd = -1;' \u2014 the object is intentionally modified so a non-const pointer is required; the call 'result = close(impl->fd);' and the handling of its return value \u2014 these do not involve pointer-to-object qualifications. Other code fragments in the snippet either do not involve pointer types or already use const where appropriate, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
