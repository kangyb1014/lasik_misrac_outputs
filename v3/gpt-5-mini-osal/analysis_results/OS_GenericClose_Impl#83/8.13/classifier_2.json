  "scenario": "The fragment declares an array of mutable OS_impl_file_internal_record_t objects (not a pointer). MISRA Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types being const-qualified where possible. In this code a non-const pointer to an element (via &OS_impl_filehandle_table[index]) is intentionally used to modify impl->fd. Because the objects are meant to be writable and the pointer is used to update them, there is no requirement to add const here. Therefore the rule is not violated."
