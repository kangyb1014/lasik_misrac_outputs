  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about unreachable code in UtAssert_DoReport we must know whether any call or called routine can fail to return (or otherwise make subsequent code unreachable), or whether macros/implementations change control flow. Explanations:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Direct callee from UtAssert_DoReport. If its implementation does not return (e.g. calls exit/longjmp or is annotated noreturn), code following the call would be unreachable. You must inspect this symbol to determine its return behavior.\n\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Appears as a callee of UT_BSP_DoText in the call graph. If this routine terminates the program (or does not return), that makes UT_BSP_DoText effectively non-returning; therefore it is required for the reachability analysis.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: A callee of UT_BSP_DoText. If it performs a nonlocal control transfer (longjmp/abort/terminate) it could also affect reachability; include to be safe in transitive analysis.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock: These are called by UT_BSP_DoText (per the graph). If either can perform nonlocal control transfer or otherwise prevent return, they could make subsequent code unreachable; include to confirm they behave as ordinary returning functions.\n\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev and OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: Additional transitive callees of UT_BSP_DoText. Include to verify they do not perform non-returning actions (longjmp/exit/etc.) that would render code unreachable.\n\n- strlen: Used at the start of UtAssert_DoReport. While standard strlen is normally returning, a project could replace or wrap it; need to confirm it does not perform nonlocal control flow that would make subsequent statements unreachable.\n\n- snprintf: Used to format the ReportBuffer prior to calling UT_BSP_DoText. Confirm snprintf is an ordinary returning function (or check project-specific implementation) because a non-returning implementation would render later statements unreachable.\n\nIn short: to decide if any part of UtAssert_DoReport is unreachable you must examine any called symbol (direct and transitive) that could be non-returning or perform nonlocal control flow; the list above contains the direct callee (UT_BSP_DoText), its transitive callees from the static call graph, and the standard library functions used by the target function."
