Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether UtAssert_DoReport is dead code (i.e., its removal would not affect program behaviour) we must know whether its observable effects are non\u2011empty. The symbols below are required because they determine whether the body of UtAssert_DoReport produces externally observable effects (I/O, synchronization, state changes or timing) or can be removed without changing behaviour:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Direct callee that receives the formatted ReportBuffer and MessageType. If UT_BSP_DoText performs any observable action (console output, logging, state changes, timing, or synchronization), then UtAssert_DoReport is not dead. We need its implementation/semantics to decide.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock / UT_BSP_Unlock: Called by UT_BSP_DoText (per the call graph). Locking/unlocking can change program timing and concurrency behaviour; their presence as side effects makes UtAssert_DoReport non\u2011removable even if output is suppressed. Include to determine timing/concurrency observability.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl / OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl / OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Lower\u2011level BSP functions invoked by UT_BSP_DoText. These perform real I/O or system state changes (console writes, mode changes, shutdown) which are externally observable; their presence would make UtAssert_DoReport non\u2011dead. We must inspect them to know whether UT_BSP_DoText is a no\u2011op or has side effects.\n\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: Called by UT_BSP_DoText (per the call graph). It can affect the content of the output (ReportBuffer) and thus whether removal changes observable data; include to assess whether the formatted output contains information used elsewhere.\n\n- UtAssertEx: The only (static) caller of UtAssert_DoReport. To determine whether removal of UtAssert_DoReport would change program behaviour we must inspect UtAssertEx to see how the return/side effects of UtAssert_DoReport are relied upon (e.g., whether caller expects side effects, timing, or relies on output). If UtAssertEx does nothing meaningful without the call, UtAssert_DoReport might be dead \u2014 else not.\n\n- strlen / snprintf: Standard library functions used to build the ReportBuffer. While usually not externally observable, they can cause runtime faults (e.g., if File or ShortDesc are invalid) or influence timing; include to confirm that the only observable effects of UtAssert_DoReport come via UT_BSP_DoText and not from UB or other side effects inside these calls.\n\nIn short: include UT_BSP_DoText and its transitive callees (locks, console I/O, shutdown helper, and any formatting helpers), the caller UtAssertEx, and the used standard functions to comprehensively determine whether removing UtAssert_DoReport would alter observable program behaviour (including I/O, state changes, timing, and concurrency)."
