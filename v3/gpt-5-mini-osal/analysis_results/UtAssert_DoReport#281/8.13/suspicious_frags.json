  "explanation": "Most pointer uses in the function already use const qualification where appropriate: the input parameters File, SubsysName, and ShortDesc are declared as const char * and are only read; BasePtr is declared as const char * and only points into File (read-only). Calls that read from const data (e.g. strlen(File), passing BasePtr and ShortDesc to snprintf) therefore do not violate the rule. The ReportBuffer declaration and the subsequent call that passes it to UT_BSP_DoText are the only places where a non-const character object is exposed as a pointer to another function; the buffer must be mutable for snprintf (so the local declaration itself cannot be const), but the callee prototype should be checked to determine whether it could or should accept a const-qualified pointer (i.e. whether UT_BSP_DoText modifies the string). No other pointer occurrences in this function require investigation under Rule 8.13."
