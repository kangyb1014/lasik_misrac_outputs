  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- strlen: The while loop controlling expression depends on FileLen, which is initialized from strlen(File). To decide if the controlling expression is invariant you must know strlen's semantics (return value for given File, behaviour on NULL, and whether strlen might be a macro or instrumented function with side-effects). If strlen were to always return 0 (or behave unexpectedly) that could make FileLen invariant; conversely predictable strlen semantics show FileLen is a computed non-constant initial value.\n\n- size_t: strlen returns size_t; the conversion from size_t to uint32 may truncate or otherwise change the initial value. To reason about whether FileLen can change from its initial value (and whether comparison with 0 is meaningful), the analysis needs the exact type semantics of size_t (width, unsignedness) and standard conversion rules.\n\n- uint32 typedef: FileLen is declared as uint32. The width and signedness of uint32 determine decrement/underflow behaviour and whether the loop variable can wrap (which affects whether FileLen>0 can be invariant). If uint32 were narrower than the returned size_t, truncation or wrap semantics matter for the loop termination analysis.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText (declaration or macro): Although UT_BSP_DoText is called after the loop in the source, if it is implemented as a macro or has side-effects at preprocessing/expansion time it could affect program state in non-obvious ways. The analysis must confirm UT_BSP_DoText cannot alter FileLen/BasePtr or otherwise change the controlling expression's evaluation path (e.g. via macros that expand earlier). This rules out hidden side-effects that might make the controlling expression effectively invariant.\n\n- Qualification/provenance of the File parameter: The loop dereferences BasePtr (derived from File). If the pointed-to object is volatile or can be modified concurrently by other threads, that could change program behaviour relevant to loop progress. Knowing whether File was declared const-only or could be volatile/alias-modified is necessary to exclude external aliasing/side-effects as reasons the controlling expression might be invariant.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal external definitions needed to decide whether the controlling expression (FileLen > 0) is a true invariant (or could be considered invariant under type/conversion/macro/aliasing semantics) for the MISRA C rule check."
