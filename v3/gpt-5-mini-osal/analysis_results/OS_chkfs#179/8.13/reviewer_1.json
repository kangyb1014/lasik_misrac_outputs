Passing a const-qualified pointer as a non-const void * violates Rule 8.13 (the callee should accept a const-qualified pointer if it does not modify the data).

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The code casts a const char * to void * ((void *)name), thereby discarding the const qualifier. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified whenever possible; passing a const-qualified object as a non-const pointer (or casting away const) violates this guidance. The appropriate fix is to make the callee accept a const-qualified pointer (e.g. change the parameter to const void * or update OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch/its callback prototype so no const is discarded) or otherwise avoid casting away const. If the callee legitimately needs to modify the data, then the caller must not pass a pointer to const \u2014 in that case the code should be redesigned to avoid passing a const object to a modifying function. But based on the snippet and typical usage (search key is not modified), the reported violation is valid."
