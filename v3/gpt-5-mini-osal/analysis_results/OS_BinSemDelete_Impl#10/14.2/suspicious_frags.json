First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "There are no explicit for statements in the provided function body, so Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops) does not apply to any other visible code fragments (the code contains only an assignment, function calls, an if/else, and returns). The only fragment that could potentially hide a for loop is the use of the macro-like construct OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...), which may expand to code containing for loops or loop-like constructs; that expansion should be inspected to ensure any for loops it contains meet Rule 14.2. No other lines in this function contain or can reasonably contain a for statement and thus do not need investigation for Rule 14.2 compliance."
