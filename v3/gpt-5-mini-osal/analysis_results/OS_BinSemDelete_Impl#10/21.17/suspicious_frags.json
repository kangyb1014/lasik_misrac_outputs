  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl or in the provided related definitions. The function only calls pthread_cond_destroy and pthread_mutex_destroy and uses the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to index OS_impl_bin_sem_table via token->obj_idx; none of these invoke string handling functions or perform buffer/string operations that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses as described by Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need to be investigated for compliance with Rule 21.17."
