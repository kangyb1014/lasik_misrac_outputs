  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code and related definitions. Specifically:\n\n- There are no uses of known compiler-specific extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or GNU inline-variants that are documented as extensions in common compiler manuals.\n- The use of pthread_* functions and pthread types are POSIX library/API calls, not compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as defined in the task.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET uses standard C operators (address-of, indexing, and a function-like macro) and the inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken uses standard C static inline semantics (C99 and later), which are not compiler extensions per the rule you supplied.\n- All typedefs, volatile qualifiers, and integer typedefs (int32_t) used are standard C constructs.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of compiler language extensions)."
