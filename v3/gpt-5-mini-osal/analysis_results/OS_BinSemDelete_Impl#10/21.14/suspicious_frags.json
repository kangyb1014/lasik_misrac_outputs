  "explanation": "I examined the provided function OS_BinSemDelete_Impl and the related definitions. There are no uses of memcmp in the target function or in the accompanying code snippets (the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, the OS_impl_bin_sem_table array, the OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t struct, the OS_object_token_t typedef, or OS_ObjectIndexFromToken). The only library calls present are pthread_cond_destroy and pthread_mutex_destroy, neither of which are string-comparison functions. No other standard string functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp, memcmp) appear in the supplied code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the provided excerpts."
