  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl that are provably unreachable. Reasoning: \n- The sem pointer is obtained via the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token). The macro expands to take the address of the token argument (&(tok)), which in the call becomes &(*token) i.e. token \u2014 so sem is assigned from the object table and that statement is reachable.\n- The pthread_cond_destroy call is executed unconditionally; both outcomes of the if test are handled (non-zero leads to return_code = OS_SEM_FAILURE; zero leads to the else branch). There is no code after the final return that would be unreachable.\n- The pthread_mutex_destroy call is inside the else branch and therefore reachable whenever pthread_cond_destroy returns success; it is not after a return so it is not dead code.\n- The return at the end returns the value set in both branches, so there is no fall-through dead code.\n- The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a simple accessor (returns token->obj_idx) and is used by the macro; it contains no unreachable statements.\n- There are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, or labels/gotos that skip code paths in this fragment that would render code unreachable.\nGiven the provided definitions and this function alone, there are no statements that are statically unreachable and therefore no fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 investigation."
