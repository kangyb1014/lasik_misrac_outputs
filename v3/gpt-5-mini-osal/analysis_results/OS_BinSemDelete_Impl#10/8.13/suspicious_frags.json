  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter declaration 'const OS_object_token_t *token' already uses a const-qualified pointer; the local pointer 'OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem' is used to modify the semaphore record (destroying the cond and mutex), so it is appropriate to be a non-const pointer; the calls to pthread_cond_destroy(&(sem->cv)) and pthread_mutex_destroy(&(sem->id)) accept non-const pointers because they modify the objects; the global array 'OS_impl_bin_sem_table' must be mutable to allow cleanup and therefore being non-const is justified. These items do not indicate missing const-qualification opportunities relevant to Rule 8.13."
