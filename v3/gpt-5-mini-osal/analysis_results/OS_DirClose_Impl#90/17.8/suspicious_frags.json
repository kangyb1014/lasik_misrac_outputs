  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the parameter pointer token. The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and there is no assignment to token (no token = ...). The macro use OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token) expands to take the address of *token (i.e. &( *token )), which yields the original token pointer for OS_ObjectIndexFromToken; this does not modify the parameter. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const pointer and only reads token->obj_idx. The subsequent operations (closedir(impl->dp); impl->dp = NULL;) modify the directory record obtained from the object table, not the function parameter token itself; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter (or objects reachable from it) is permitted by the rule, provided the pointer variable is not reassigned. Therefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation for Rule 17.8."
