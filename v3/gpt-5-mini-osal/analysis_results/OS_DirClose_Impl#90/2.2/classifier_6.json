The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DirClose_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_DirClose_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n\n    closedir(impl->dp);\n    impl->dp = NULL;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DirClose_Impl:\nint32 OS_DirOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    DIR *                          dp = opendir(local_path);\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    if (dp == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    impl     = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n    impl->dp = dp;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_DirRead_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, os_dirent_t *dirent)\n{\n    struct dirent *                de;\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n\n    /* NOTE - the readdir() call is non-reentrant ....\n     * However, this is performed while the global dir table lock is taken.\n     * Therefore this ensures that only one such call can occur at any given time.\n     *\n     * Static analysis tools may warn about this because they do not know\n     * this function is externally serialized via the global lock.\n     */\n    /* cppcheck-suppress readdirCalled */\n    /* cppcheck-suppress nonreentrantFunctionsreaddir */\n    de = readdir(impl->dp);\n    if (de == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    strncpy(dirent->FileName, de->d_name, sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1);\n    dirent->FileName[sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1] = 0;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_DirRewind_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n    rewinddir(impl->dp);\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nimpl->dp = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment impl->dp = NULL is not dead code. It clears a pointer that would otherwise be dangling after closedir(), serving as a sentinel that the directory handle is closed (and can be checked elsewhere or prevents reuse/double-close). Removing this assignment could change program behaviour (e.g. checks for NULL would fail, or a stale non-NULL pointer could be misused), so the operation is effective and its removal would affect program behaviour."
