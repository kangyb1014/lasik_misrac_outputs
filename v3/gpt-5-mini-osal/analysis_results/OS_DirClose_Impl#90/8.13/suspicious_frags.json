  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Analysis of all pointer uses:\n\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 the pointed-to type is already const-qualified, satisfying the rule.\n- The local variable impl is declared as OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t * and is used to modify a member (impl->dp = NULL). Because the pointed-to object is modified, it cannot be declared as pointer-to-const; thus no violation.\n- impl->dp is passed to closedir(), which expects a non-const DIR * (the DIR object is operated on by the API), so the pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified.\n- No other pointer objects appear in the fragment.\n\nTherefore there are no places in this function where a pointer could (and should) point to a const-qualified type but does not."
