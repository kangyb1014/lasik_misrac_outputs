  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the 'return -1' statement is executed only when OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS, so it is reachable at runtime whenever the low-level call fails. There is no evidence in the fragment that OS_NetworkGetID_Impl is constant (always returns OS_SUCCESS) or otherwise guaranteed to never allow that branch (for example, marked noreturn). The only hypothetical violation would be if OS_NetworkGetID_Impl is known to always return OS_SUCCESS (making the failure branch unreachable), but that information is not present in the given code fragment."
