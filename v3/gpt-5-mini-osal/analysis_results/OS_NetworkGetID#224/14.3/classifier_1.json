  "scenario": "The macro definition itself (#define OS_SUCCESS (0)) does not constitute a controlling expression and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. However, a specific violation scenario is: given the provided implementation where OS_NetworkGetID_Impl always returns OS_SUCCESS (0), the controlling expression if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS) is invariant (always false). That invariant controlling expression in the if statement would violate Rule 14.3 (no permitted exception applies)."
