This is not an infinite-loop or the permitted do-while constant-false case, so Rule 14.3 is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetID:\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 14.3 forbids controlling expressions that are invariant. In the provided code OS_NetworkGetID_Impl is defined to always return OS_SUCCESS (0), so the test OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS is always false \u2014 an invariant controlling expression. This is not one of the permitted exceptions (not an infinite loop nor the specific do-while constant-false case). The fact that the function has a side-effect (writing *IdBuf) does not change that the boolean outcome of the controlling expression is constant. Therefore the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is correct."
