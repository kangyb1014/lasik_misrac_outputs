  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_NetworkGetID code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 14.3.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\nHere are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_NetworkGetID.\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID(void)\n{\n    int32 IdBuf;\n\n    /* always delegate to low-level API */\n    if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* return a hardcoded value on failure */\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    return IdBuf;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nOS_NetworkGetID_Impl always returns the constant OS_SUCCESS (0). As a result the controlling expression in the caller if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS) is invariant (always false). This is not one of the permitted exceptions (not an infinite loop nor the permitted do-while pattern), so Rule 14.3 is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetID:\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the provided code OS_NetworkGetID_Impl is defined to always return OS_SUCCESS (macro 0), so the controlling expression if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS) is statically invariant (always false). MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions except for the listed exceptions (infinite loops or the special do-while case), neither of which applies here. The fact that the call has a side effect (writing IdBuf) does not change that the controlling expression\u2019s value is invariant. Note: if the implementation were in a different translation unit and not visible to the analyser, a tool might not flag this; given the shown definition, the reported violation is valid."
