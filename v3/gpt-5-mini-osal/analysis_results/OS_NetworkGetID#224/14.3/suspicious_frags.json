  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions. The conditional in OS_NetworkGetID uses the return value of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl to decide control flow. However, OS_NetworkGetID_Impl, as defined, always returns the constant OS_SUCCESS (which is defined as 0). That makes the controlling expression effectively invariant (the if condition is always false), so the if-branch is dead code and should be investigated. Other fragments (variable declaration int32 IdBuf;, the final return IdBuf;, the assignment *IdBuf = gethostid();, and comments) are not controlling expressions and do not make control flow invariant by themselves, so they do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
