  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not use any of the <string.h> string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function only declares a local integer, delegates to a low-level API, checks the result, and returns integer values; none of these lines perform character-buffer or memory-buffer operations from <string.h> that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore no other fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If the low-level implementation referenced here uses string functions, that implementation should be reviewed separately.)"
