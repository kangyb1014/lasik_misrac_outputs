  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only declares an int32 variable and does not call any <string.h> functions nor use character-buffer pointers. The declaration itself cannot cause out-of-bounds string accesses. (A possible violation would occur if the address of IdBuf were passed to a string function that writes more bytes than sizeof(IdBuf) \u2014 e.g. passing (char *)&IdBuf to strcpy/memcpy with a length exceeding sizeof(IdBuf))."
