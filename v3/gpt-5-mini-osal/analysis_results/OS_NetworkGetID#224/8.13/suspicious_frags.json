  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer-related usage is the local variable IdBuf and its address being passed to OS_NetworkGetID_Impl. There are no other pointer declarations, pointer casts, pointer-returning expressions, or other pointer arguments in the remainder of the code (the return statements and comments do not involve pointers), so no other fragments need investigation for this rule."
