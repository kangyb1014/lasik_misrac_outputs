  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the fragment as written. Passing &ObjectCount to OS_ForEachObjectOfType allows the callee to modify the object pointed to (the count), which is permitted by the rule. A violation would occur if the callee modified the pointer parameter itself (for example, within OS_ForEachObjectOfType or OS_CleanUpObject doing an assignment to the pointer parameter, e.g. void OS_CleanUpObject(uint32 *count){ count = NULL; } ), since assigning to the pointer parameter would break Rule 17.8."
