  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the call itself. Passing &ObjectCount supplies a pointer to the object which the callee/callback may legitimately modify (e.g. increment the count). MISRA Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the pointer parameter (the formal parameter variable) itself inside the called function (e.g. reassigning the pointer), not modifying the object it points to. The fragment shown does not show any modification of the pointer parameter, so it does not by itself violate Rule 17.8. A violation would occur only if OS_ForEachObject or the callback were to reassign the received pointer parameter (for example, doing param = NULL or param++), which is not evidenced here."
