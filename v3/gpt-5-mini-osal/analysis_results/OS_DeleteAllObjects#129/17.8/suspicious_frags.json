  "explanation": "OS_DeleteAllObjects itself has no parameters, so local assignments (++TryCount, ObjectCount = 0) and control-flow constructs (while(true), break, comments) do not relate to Rule 17.8 and need not be investigated. The call OS_TaskDelay(5) passes a constant and does not modify any function parameter in this scope. The only fragments that could involve modification of function parameters are the calls that pass a function pointer (OS_CleanUpObject) and the address of a local variable (&ObjectCount) to iterator functions; those calls should be investigated because the called functions (or the callback) may modify their parameter variables (e.g. reassigning pointer parameters) which would violate Rule 17.8. All other lines are operations on local variables or constants and therefore not relevant to this MISRA rule."
