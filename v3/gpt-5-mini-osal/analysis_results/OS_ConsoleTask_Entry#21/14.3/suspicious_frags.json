  "explanation": "No other controlling expressions in the function present a potential invariant issue. The if statement (if (OS_ObjectIdGetById(...) == OS_SUCCESS)) depends on a function call result and is not an invariant controlling expression. There are no for or do-while loops or switch statements in this function besides the reported while. The remaining statements (assignments, function calls such as OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl and sem_wait, object table access and token release) are not controlling expressions and therefore do not fall under Rule 14.3's invariant-controlling-expression requirement."
