First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2: the loop counter (i) is set in the first clause (i = 0), the second clause uses only the loop counter and a constant (i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS) and has no persistent side effects, and the third clause (++i) modifies only the loop counter. The loop counter i is not modified in the loop body. No functions are called inside the loop body that could have side effects affecting the loop counter. Declarations and constants (UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS, UT_StubTable, and types) are ordinary and do not contradict the rule. Therefore only the initialization of the pointer before the loop and the explicit modification of that pointer inside the loop body are worth investigation to determine whether that pointer is being used as a second loop counter (which would breach the requirement that there be only one loop counter and that it not be modified in the loop body) or otherwise creates an alias/side-effect relationship that invalidates the for-statement being well-formed."
