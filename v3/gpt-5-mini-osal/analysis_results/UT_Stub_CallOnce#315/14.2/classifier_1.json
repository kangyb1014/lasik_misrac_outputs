  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_CallOnce:\n```c\nvoid UT_Stub_CallOnce(void (*Func)(void))\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *OnceEnt;\n    UT_EntryKey_t        FuncKey;\n    int32                i;\n\n    if (Func == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    FuncKey = (UT_EntryKey_t)Func;\n    OnceEnt = NULL;\n    StubPtr = UT_StubTable;\n    for (i = 0; i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS; ++i)\n    {\n        if (StubPtr->EntryType == UT_ENTRYTYPE_UNUSED && OnceEnt == NULL)\n        {\n            OnceEnt = StubPtr;\n        }\n        else if (StubPtr->EntryType == UT_ENTRYTYPE_CALL_ONCE && StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey)\n        {\n            OnceEnt = StubPtr;\n            break;\n        }\n        ++StubPtr;\n    }\n\n    if (OnceEnt == NULL)\n    {\n        /* should never happen -- UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS needs increase if it does */\n        UtAssert_Abort(\"Cannot do CallOnce - UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS too low?\");\n    }\n    else if (OnceEnt->EntryType == UT_ENTRYTYPE_UNUSED)\n    {\n        OnceEnt->EntryType = UT_ENTRYTYPE_CALL_ONCE;\n        OnceEnt->FuncKey   = FuncKey;\n\n        Func();\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UT_Stub_CallOnce:\n#define UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS 200\n...\nstatic UT_StubTableEntry_t UT_StubTable[UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS] = {{0}}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    UT_EntryType_t EntryType;\n    uint32         ModeFlags;\n    UT_EntryKey_t  FuncKey;\n    UT_EntryData_t Data;\n} UT_StubTableEntry_t\n...\ntypedef cpuaddr UT_EntryKey_t\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nStubPtr = UT_StubTable;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement \"StubPtr = UT_StubTable;\" merely initializes a pointer before the for loop and is not part of any for-clause. The for loop itself uses a single loop counter (i) that is initialized in the first clause (i = 0), tested in the second clause (i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS) which only references the counter, and incremented in the third clause (++i) which only modifies the counter. Although StubPtr is modified within the loop body (++StubPtr), it is not used in the loop-controlling expressions, so Rule 14.2 is satisfied."
