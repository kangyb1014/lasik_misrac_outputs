  "explanation": "Reasoning about other pointer usages in the function and related definitions that do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13:\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t *OnceEnt; and subsequent writes OnceEnt->EntryType = ...; OnceEnt->FuncKey = ...; \u2014 OnceEnt is used to modify the pointed-to table entry. Because the code intentionally writes to the pointee, making the pointed-to type const would be incorrect, so these occurrences are not candidates for Rule 8.13.\n\n- The global UT_StubTable array is written to by this code (entries are initialized/modified), so it cannot be made const; therefore the table itself and pointers used to modify it are not candidates.\n\n- The function parameter void (*Func)(void) refers to a function object. C does not support const-qualified function types in the sense required by Rule 8.13 (qualifying the function type with const is not meaningful), so that parameter is not a valid target for this rule.\n\n- UtAssert_Abort takes a const char * and string literals are already const-like; this usage complies with the rule.\n\n- The cast FuncKey = (UT_EntryKey_t)Func converts a function pointer to an integer type; this is not about pointer-to-const qualification and thus outside the scope of Rule 8.13.\n\nThe selected fragments are the places where a pointer to the table is declared/used only for reading/traversal (StubPtr) and then assigned to OnceEnt; StubPtr appears to only read the table entries, so per Rule 8.13 it could be considered to point to a const-qualified type and therefore warrants investigation. No other pointer usages in the function present the same opportunity for adding a const qualification to the pointed-to type."
