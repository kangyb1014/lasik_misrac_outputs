  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8 within this snippet: OS_API_Teardown has no parameters (void), and OS_DeleteAllObjects() is called with no arguments. The boolean literal true passed to OS_ApplicationShutdown is an rvalue at the call site and cannot itself be modified here. The only possible Rule 17.8 concern in this snippet would be whether OS_ApplicationShutdown's implementation modifies its parameter (e.g. assigns to the parameter variable or, for pointer parameters, assigns to the pointer itself); that requires inspecting OS_ApplicationShutdown's definition, which is why its call is reported for investigation."
