  "explanation": "No clear instances of dead code (operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour) were identified in the provided snippets. Each executed statement either has observable side effects, updates global state, or participates in control flow and data structures that other code depends on. Examples: \n\n- OS_DeleteAllObjects(): performs repeated deletion attempts and calls OS_ForEachObject/OS_CleanUpObject and OS_TaskDelay(5) \u2014 these calls have side effects (object cleanup, potential blocking/delay) and affect program behaviour. The TryCount/loop control is used to bound attempts.\n\n- OS_ApplicationShutdown(true): writes OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState and then calls OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() which sends a signal (kill) \u2014 both are observable side effects required to wake the idle loop or otherwise change system state.\n\n- OS_TaskDelay(): simple wrapper but it invokes OS_TaskDelay_Impl() which is expected to have timing/blocking behaviour; the call is executed in OS_DeleteAllObjects and cannot be removed without changing timing/behaviour.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData() / UT_GetStubEntry() / UT_SetHandlerFunction() / UT_DefaultStubImpl(): these routines manipulate test-stub tables, set handler functions, and forward varargs \u2014 they update shared data structures (UT_StubTable, UT_MaxStubSearchLen) and install handlers used later. The assignments and pointer manipulations (e.g., trimming Name) affect how callbacks are invoked and are therefore not removable.\n\n- OS_ApplicationExit(): calls exit() with appropriate status \u2014 observable effect.\n\nNo code fragment in the supplied sections is an operation that is executed but appears to have no effect on program behaviour. Therefore, there are no suspected violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 in the provided code snippets."
