  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were not marked for investigation because they perform clearly necessary, non-redundant operations or are not executed code: - OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_prop); expands to a runtime pointer-validation/BUGCHECK and cannot be removed without changing behavior. - The call return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(...); performs the lookup/transaction init required to obtain a valid token; removing it would change behavior. - The conditional if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) { ... } controls whether the object token is valid and therefore is not dead. - record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_global_queue_table, token); dereferences the object table using the token index and is required to get the source data. - The final return return_code; communicates the function result; it cannot be removed. - The comment block is non-executable and not subject to the dead-code rule. The four fragments reported should be investigated because they are candidates for redundant or coupled operations where one could be removable without changing behavior (for example: the memset/strncpy interaction for NUL-termination, or whether explicit release is required), so they warrant review to ensure they are not dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
