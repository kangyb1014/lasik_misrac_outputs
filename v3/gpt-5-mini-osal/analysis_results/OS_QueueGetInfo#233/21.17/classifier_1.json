  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call memset(queue_prop, 0, sizeof(OS_queue_prop_t)) writes exactly the size of the type OS_queue_prop_t into the object referenced by queue_prop (the parameter is of type OS_queue_prop_t *). The code also performs a null check (OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_prop)), so under normal use where the caller passes a pointer to a full OS_queue_prop_t object this does not access beyond the bounds of the referenced object. A violation would only occur if the caller passed a pointer that does not actually point to a complete OS_queue_prop_t object (for example a pointer into a smaller buffer or a sub-object), but that is a caller misuse rather than an issue with this call site."
