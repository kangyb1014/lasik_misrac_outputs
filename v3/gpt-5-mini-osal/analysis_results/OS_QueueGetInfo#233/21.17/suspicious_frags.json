  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> in this function are the memset and strncpy lines, so those are the fragments that require investigation for Rule 21.17. Other statements do not invoke string handling library routines and therefore are not relevant to this rule: the OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_prop) macro is a parameter null check (not a string operation), the OS_ObjectIdGetById call and subsequent OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET just retrieve an object and do not perform string operations, the simple assignment queue_prop->creator = record->creator does not involve <string.h>, OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) is object management (not string handling), and the return/flow-control statements likewise do not use string functions. Hence no other fragments need investigation under this rule."
