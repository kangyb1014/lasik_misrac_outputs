  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the presented function. The code contains only standard C constructs and library calls: standard types (size_t, pointer types, bool), standard library functions (malloc, memcpy), standard macros (NULL), and simple control flow and assignments. There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (for example no __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, _Thread_local, _Nullable/_Nonnull annotations, or other vendor extensions), no use of C++-only features, and no nonstandard pragmas. User-defined types and functions/macros (UT_EntryKey_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t, UtAssert_Abort, UT_* identifiers) are application-specific but are not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
