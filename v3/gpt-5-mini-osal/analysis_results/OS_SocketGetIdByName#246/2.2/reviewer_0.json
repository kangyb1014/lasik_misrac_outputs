  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A\u2019s claim rests on a speculative scenario (that ARGCHECK expands to a no-op or is redundant) rather than on demonstrated executed dead code in the provided build. Key points:\n\n- The ARGCHECK invocation cited by agent A is in OS_ObjectIdFindByName, not in the target wrapper OS_SocketGetIdByName. The reported function simply calls OS_ObjectIdFindByName and returns its result; there is no intrinsic dead code in OS_SocketGetIdByName as shown.\n\n- MISRA Rule 2.2 applies to code that is executed but whose removal would not change program behaviour. If ARGCHECK expands to nothing in a particular build then the check is not executed at all (so it is not \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 under the rule \u2014 it\u2019s absent). Conversely, if ARGCHECK does execute, it typically has observable effects (diagnostics, error handling, timing) in at least some configurations (e.g. debug builds), so its removal could change behaviour.\n\n- Whether a macro becomes a no-op depends on build-time configuration. You cannot declare a Rule 2.2 violation without evidence that the statement is actually executed in an existing build and that removal would not alter behaviour in any relevant configuration. The provided code and macros (e.g. OS_CHECK_POINTER -> BUGCHECK) indicate these checks are intended for diagnostics/error detection and may change behaviour or observability, so they are not provably dead.\n\nTo actually demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation you would need to show (for the supplied product configuration) that a statement is executed at runtime and that removing it would not affect program behaviour in any observable way for that configuration. That proof is not present here."
