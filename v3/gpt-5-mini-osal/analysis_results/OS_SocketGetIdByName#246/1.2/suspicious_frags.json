  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided fragments. The code uses standard C constructs: function definitions, pointer parameters, const, typedefs (e.g., int32 mapped to int32_t), and macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, BUGCHECK, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) \u2014 none of which, as shown, use compiler-specific extension syntax. I inspected for common compiler extensions (GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, typeof, __declspec, inline assembly, trailing comma in parameter packs, or other vendor keywords) and found none in the shown code. The macros themselves could potentially expand to extension constructs, but their expansions are not provided; based on the supplied definitions and usage there is no evidence of a language extension. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
