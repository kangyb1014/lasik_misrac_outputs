  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided code modify a function parameter variable itself. Details:\n\n- OS_SocketGetIdByName: neither parameter (sock_id, sock_name) is reassigned in the function. The function only passes sock_id and sock_name to other routines and returns a local return_code.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFindByName: the only write involving the pointer parameter is \u2018\u2018*object_id = token.obj_id;\u2019\u2019 which modifies the object referred to by the pointer, not the pointer parameter itself \u2014 this is explicitly allowed by Rule 17.8. The function does not reassign the parameter object_id.\n\n- OS_printf: the parameter String is const and only read; it is not reassigned.\n\n- Macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER -> BUGCHECK and ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK shown): these evaluate the pointer but do not reassign the parameter. There is no evidence in the provided definitions that these macros rebind or assign to the parameter variables.\n\n- Passing a pointer parameter to another function (e.g., passing sock_id to OS_ObjectIdFindByName) passes the pointer by value and does not constitute modifying the parameter itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code and macro definitions, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing further needs investigation for this rule."
