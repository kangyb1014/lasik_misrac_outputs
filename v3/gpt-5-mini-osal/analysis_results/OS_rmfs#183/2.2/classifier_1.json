  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_rmfs:\n```c\nint32 OS_rmfs(const char *devname)\n{\n    int32             return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(devname);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, devname, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /*\n         * NOTE: It is likely that if the file system is mounted,\n         * this call to stop the volume will fail.\n         *\n         * It would be prudent to first check the flags to ensure that\n         * the filesystem is unmounted first, but this would break\n         * compatibility with the existing unit tests.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(&token);\n\n        /* Free the entry in the master table  */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(return_code, &token);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_rmfs:\n#define OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(str) OS_CHECK_STRING(str,OS_MAX_PATH_LEN,OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG)\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(lock_mode, idtype, OS_ObjectNameMatch, (void *)name, token);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * This is a no-op.\n     *\n     * Volatile volumes are just directories created in the temp dir,\n     * and this will not remove the directories just in case something\n     * went wrong.\n     *\n     * If the volume is started again, the directory will be re-used.\n     */\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    osal_id_t final_id;\n\n    /* Clear the OSAL ID if successful -
