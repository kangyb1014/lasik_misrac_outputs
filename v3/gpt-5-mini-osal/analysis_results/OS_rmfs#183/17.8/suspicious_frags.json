  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, devname, &token);",
    "OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(devname);",
    "int32 OS_rmfs(const char *devname)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The only function parameter is devname, so the function declaration is included for context. The two calls that use devname (the OS_CHECK_PATHNAME macro and the OS_ObjectIdGetByName call) are flagged because a macro expansion or the called routine could (illegally) assign to or otherwise modify the parameter pointer itself. All other lines in the function do not reference or assign to the parameter devname: assignments to return_code, the use and modification of token via &token, the calls OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(&token) and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(...,&token), and the comments cannot change the function parameter pointer, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.8."
