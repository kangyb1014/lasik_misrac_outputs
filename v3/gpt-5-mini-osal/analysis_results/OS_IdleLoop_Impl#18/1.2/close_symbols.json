  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations and definitions referenced in its single statement. - POSIX_GlobalVars: the global variable's definition may use extension constructs (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or non-standard attributes). Examining the actual symbol definition is required to detect such extensions. - POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: the member itself (and how it is declared/initialized) must be checked for use of extensions (designated initializers, compound literal GNU extensions, or attributes attached to the member). - sigsuspend: the function call could be a macro or inline wrapper that expands to compiler-specific code (asm, typeof, statement expressions, or __attribute__ annotations). You must inspect the sigsuspend declaration/macro to see whether it uses any extensions. - sigset_t: the type of NormalSigMask may be a typedef that itself uses nonstandard constructs (e.g., builtin types, compiler-specific typedefs or bitfield tricks). - signal.h (sigsuspend prototype and related macros/aliases): the header that supplies sigsuspend may contain macros or aliases that are compiler/library specific; the header must be inspected for extension usage. - sigsuspend implementation/alias (e.g. __sigsuspend or libc internal symbol): some platforms implement sigsuspend via an internal symbol or macro indirection; those implementations can include compiler extensions (asm directives, builtins). Checking the actual implementation/alias ensures no hidden extensions are used. Checking these symbols and their defining headers/translation units is sufficient to determine whether the target function relies on any compiler language extensions."
