  "explanation": "- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global variable whose member is passed to sigsuspend; you must inspect its definition to see the type and contents referenced by the call site. If POSIX_GlobalVars is implemented via indirection or contains pointers to character buffers, that could be relevant to a string-handling violation (even though none appear in this function).\\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: The exact member passed (&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask). You need its declaration/type and layout to ensure the address passed is a valid sigset_t (not a char array or alias to a buffer that might be manipulated by string functions elsewhere).\\n- sigsuspend: The called function. Confirm whether the project uses the platform library sigsuspend or a project-local replacement. Although sigsuspend itself is not a <string.h> routine, a wrapper could call string functions, or there could be a macro that redirects the call.\\n- sigset_t (type): The type of NormalSigMask. Knowing whether this is an integer/bitset type or something aliasing character buffers rules out the possibility that this code is invoking string.h functions on pointer parameters here.\\n- Function(s) that initialize or compute POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (task init routine): The comment says NormalSigMask is computed during task init. You must inspect the initializer(s) to see if any string.h functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/...) are used on objects that could overlap with NormalSigMask or its storage, or if NormalSigMask is built from objects that involve string operations. This is necessary because misuse could originate at initialization.\\n- Any local wrapper/macros that replace or wrap sigsuspend in this codebase: A project wrapper might perform additional work (including calling string.h functions) before/after invoking the real sigsuspend. If present, that wrapper must be inspected for string-handling uses that could access out-of-bounds memory.\\n- <signal.h> prototype for sigsuspend: To confirm the expected parameter type and semantics of sigsuspend on the target platform and ensure the call here matches the declared prototype (helps prove there is no misuse of pointer parameters to standard string functions).\\n\\nRationale summary: The target function itself contains no calls to any <string.h> functions, so a violation is unlikely at this site. However, to be certain under MISRA you must (1) confirm the types and definitions of the objects whose addresses are passed here (POSIX_GlobalVars and NormalSigMask), (2) check any code that initializes or manipulates those objects, and (3) ensure there is no local wrapper around sigsuspend that introduces string-handling calls. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to perform those checks."
