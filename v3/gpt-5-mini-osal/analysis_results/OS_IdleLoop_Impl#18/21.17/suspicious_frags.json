  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code. The function body contains only a call to sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask); and the related symbol is initialized as POSIX_GlobalVars_t POSIX_GlobalVars = {0}. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns calls to standard string-handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc. None of those functions (or any other obvious buffer/string operations) appear in the target code or the provided related symbol definitions, so there are no fragments to investigate for this rule. (Note: if an external or library implementation called here were known to use string.h functions unsafely, that would be outside the scope of the provided source fragments.)"
