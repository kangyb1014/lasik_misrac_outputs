  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the only areas in the provided code that can produce potentially unreachable code (blocking/non-returning behavior or indefinite looping) and therefore warrant investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1. Other fragments in the provided code are not included because they do not contain unconditional infinite loops, non-returning calls, or obviously unreachable statements: e.g., UT_ExecuteBasicHandler contains a normal conditional and then calls UT_DefaultStubImpl (no unconditional non-returning call), global initializers (POSIX_GlobalVars = {0}) are data, and there are no other functions or code paths in the snippet that contain statements after an unconditional return/exit or otherwise unreachable code. Therefore no other fragments require investigation for unreachable-code concerns based on the supplied code."
