  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_IdleLoop_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)\n{\n    /*\n     * Unblock signals and wait for something to occur\n     *\n     * Note - \"NormalSigMask\" was calculated during task init to be the original signal mask\n     * of the process PLUS all \"RT\" signals.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask) has observable runtime effects (it atomically replaces the calling thread's signal mask and suspends the thread until a signal is delivered). Removing that call would change the program behaviour (the thread would not wait/unblock signals as intended), so this is not dead code. The zero-initialization of POSIX_GlobalVars does not make the call a no-op and does not satisfy the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
