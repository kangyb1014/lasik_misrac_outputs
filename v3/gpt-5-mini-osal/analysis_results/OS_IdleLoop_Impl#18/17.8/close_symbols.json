  "explanation": "- POSIX_GlobalVars (declaration): Needed to confirm whether POSIX_GlobalVars is an object or a pointer and to see its linkage/visibility. If POSIX_GlobalVars were a macro or a pointer, the expression &POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask could behave differently and could imply modifications; the declaration clarifies this.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member declaration and type): Required to know the exact type of the member being addressed and to ensure that taking its address is not invoking a side-effecting macro or lvalue computation. Also needed to check whether the expression could modify a function parameter indirectly.\n- sigset_t (typedef / underlying type): sigsuspend takes a pointer to a sigset_t (or equivalent). Knowing the type ensures correct interpretation of the argument type (constness, size) and whether passing its address is appropriate.\n- sigsuspend (declaration/prototype or any wrapper/macro that replaces it): The prototype (e.g. int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask)) is necessary to determine the parameter type and constness. MISRA\u2019s rule concerns modification of function parameters; if the callee\u2019s parameter type is non-const pointer or the name is actually a macro/wrapper that modifies the pointer argument, that could affect the analysis.\n- Any macro/inline wrapper that redefines POSIX_GlobalVars or NormalSigMask: To rule out that POSIX_GlobalVars or NormalSigMask are macros with side effects (expansions that could modify parameters or perform assignments) rather than simple object members.\n\nTogether these symbols allow verification that OS_IdleLoop_Impl does not assign to or otherwise modify any of its own function parameters (it has none), and that the pointer value passed to sigsuspend is a computed rvalue address of a global object whose address-of operation and the callee prototype do not imply modification of a parameter variable in the caller (the prohibition in MISRA is about modifying a function\u2019s parameter variable itself)."
