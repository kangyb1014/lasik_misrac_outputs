Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required for MISRA C for-loop analysis:\n\n1) sigsuspend (prototype / implementation if available)\n   - The rule requires that the behaviour of any functions called inside a for-loop body be considered as part of the loop body. Even though OS_IdleLoop_Impl contains no for loop itself, callers may call OS_IdleLoop_Impl from a for loop, or OS_IdleLoop_Impl may be used in contexts where its callees are inside loops. You need the sigsuspend declaration/implementation to verify that it does not contain for-loops that modify objects used as loop counters or have side effects that would violate the rule.\n\n2) POSIX_GlobalVars (global variable / struct definition)\n   - OS_IdleLoop_Impl references POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask. To reason about side effects and whether any loop counter or loop-control objects are modified by functions called here (or elsewhere), you must know the exact definition and linkage of the global object (is it volatile, does it alias other objects, is it modified by other functions called from loops?).\n\n3) POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member declaration/definition)\n   - The call passes &POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask to sigsuspend. You must know the type and storage of this member (and whether it is or can be modified by other code) to determine whether it could be used as or alias a loop counter or loop-control flag, or be modified by functions called from loop bodies.\n\n4) sigset_t (typedef/definition)\n   - The exact type of NormalSigMask is needed to understand how it is used and whether operations on it (in this or called functions) could violate the for-loop clauses (for example, if sigset_t is a struct with fields that may be manipulated in called functions).\n\n5) OS_IdleLoop (definition/source)\n   - OS_IdleLoop is a direct caller of OS_IdleLoop_Impl (per the call graph). If OS_IdleLoop contains a for loop whose body calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl, the MISRA rule requires inspecting whether the loop clauses are well-formed considering the behaviour of OS_IdleLoop_Impl. You must review OS_IdleLoop to see whether a for loop is present and whether any loop counter could be modified (directly or indirectly) by OS_IdleLoop_Impl or its callees.\n\n6) UT_ExecuteBasicHandler (definition/source)\n   - OS_IdleLoop calls UT_ExecuteBasicHandler as well. If OS_IdleLoop uses a for loop that calls one or both of these functions in its body, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler's behaviour must be examined because it could modify loop counters or loop-control objects used by the for loop.\n\n7) OS_Application_Run (definition/source)\n   - OS_Application_Run is a caller of OS_IdleLoop. A for loop in a higher-level caller might invoke OS_IdleLoop or OS_IdleLoop_Impl; to be thorough, examine OS_Application_Run for loops that include calls into the idle loop path so you can determine whether any loop counters are modified by called functions.\n\nNote: also include any wrapper functions or inline implementations around sigsuspend (or alternative signal-wait helpers) if your codebase defines them; those implementations must be inspected for for-loops and side effects as well."
