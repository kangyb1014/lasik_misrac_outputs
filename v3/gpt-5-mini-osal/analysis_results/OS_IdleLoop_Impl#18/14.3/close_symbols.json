  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide MISRA \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\":\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - Need the object/struct definition to locate the NormalSigMask member and confirm whether the mask object is a mutable variable or a compile-time constant. If the mask object were a constant/invariant, that could affect analysis of any control semantics that depend on it.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask\n  - Need the actual member definition and storage class/type to determine if it is an invariant (const/compile-time constant) or a modifiable object. The comment says it was \"calculated during task init\" \u2014 inspecting the real definition/initializer is required to know whether any controlling behaviour is derived from an invariant.\n\n- (code that initialises POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask)\n  - The initialization/assignment site(s) (task init routine(s)) are required to see if NormalSigMask is set once to a constant value or updated at runtime. That distinction matters when deciding whether any control is effectively invariant.\n\n- sigsuspend (declaration/semantics)\n  - Need the prototype and semantic description (POSIX semantics: sigsuspend temporarily installs the given mask and waits for a signal) to determine whether this call constitutes a control construct that could be considered an \"invariant controlling expression\" or an infinite-wait exception under MISRA. Understanding whether sigsuspend returns only on signals (and thus is not a loop control) is necessary.\n\n- sigset_t (typedef)\n  - The exact type of NormalSigMask is required to know if its address/pointer use could be treated as an invariant expression and whether the object is modified through other APIs.\n\n- OS_IdleLoop\n  - OS_IdleLoop is the immediate caller of OS_IdleLoop_Impl. Any loop or controlling expression in OS_IdleLoop (e.g., while(1) or other loops with invariant conditions) must be analysed together with OS_IdleLoop_Impl to determine if an invariant controlling expression exists in the overall idle path or if the call here is part of an allowed infinite-wait idiom.\n\n- OS_Application_Run\n  - This higher-level caller may contain the outer control structure that drives the idle loop. To conclude whether there is an invariant controlling expression in the execution path, the caller chain must be inspected up to the application run level.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler\n  - OS_IdleLoop calls this handler; its behaviour (does it loop, block, or never return?) can affect whether the overall control flow contains invariant controlling expressions. Including it lets the analyser see if control is actually transferred to other routines that contain such constructs.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any \"controlling expression\" is invariant you must inspect the data used here (the NormalSigMask object and how it is initialised/modified), the semantics of sigsuspend (is this a control/loop-like/blocking call that falls under MISRA exceptions), and the callers (OS_IdleLoop / OS_Application_Run / any handlers) to find any loop conditions that might be invariant."
