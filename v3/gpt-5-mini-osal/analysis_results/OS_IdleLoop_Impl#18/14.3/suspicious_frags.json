  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 applies to loop controlling expressions. In the provided code the only loop construct present is the while loop above (reported). Other code fragments do not contain loop controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3: \n- OS_IdleLoop_Impl contains no loop; it only calls sigsuspend. \n- OS_Application_Run simply calls OS_IdleLoop; it has no loop itself. \n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler contains an if and function calls but no loop controlling expression. \n- The shown initializations and function calls (e.g. UT_DefaultStubImpl, UT_SetHandlerFunction) do not include loops. \nBecause there are no other loop controlling expressions in the provided snippets, no additional fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
