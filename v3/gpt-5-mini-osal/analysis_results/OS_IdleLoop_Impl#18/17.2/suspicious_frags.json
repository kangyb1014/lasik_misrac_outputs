  "explanation": "Only fragments that perform function calls or can cause control to transfer into handlers are relevant for checking indirect/self-recursion. The sigsuspend call in OS_IdleLoop_Impl is the primary point of concern because it can return due to a signal and signal handlers (not shown) may call back into OS_IdleLoop or OS_IdleLoop_Impl, creating potential indirect recursion. The loop in OS_IdleLoop repeatedly calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl and thus is relevant for investigation to determine if any call chain leads back to these functions. OS_Application_Run simply invokes OS_IdleLoop and is included for completeness as the entry point. UT_ExecuteBasicHandler is included because it installs/executes handler functions (UT_SetHandlerFunction/UT_DefaultStubImpl) which could potentially call back into the same code paths and produce indirect recursion. The remaining items in the provided snippets (e.g. the POSIX_GlobalVars initialization and comment-only lines) do not perform calls and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
