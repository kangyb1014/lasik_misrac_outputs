  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine its callers, callees and any asynchronous entry points that sigsuspend can trigger: \n\n- OS_IdleLoop: immediate caller per the call graph. Needed to detect cycles that include OS_IdleLoop -> OS_IdleLoop_Impl -> ... -> OS_IdleLoop.\n- OS_Application_Run: caller of OS_IdleLoop; required to trace higher-level call chains that might close a cycle back to OS_IdleLoop_Impl.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: called by OS_IdleLoop; it could call back into OS_IdleLoop or OS_IdleLoop_Impl (creating indirect recursion) so its body must be inspected.\n- sigsuspend: the target calls this system function. Although sigsuspend itself does not call user functions directly, it unblocks/waits for signals which can cause delivery of signal handlers; those handlers may call into the OS functions and create indirect recursion. Understanding sigsuspend semantics is needed to reason about that path.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars and POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: OS_IdleLoop_Impl passes NormalSigMask to sigsuspend. You must know which signals remain unmasked (i.e., which handlers can run while idle) to know which handlers are relevant for recursion analysis.\n- registered signal handler functions (any function passed to signal/sigaction): any signal handler that can be invoked while in OS_IdleLoop_Impl could call OS_IdleLoop, OS_IdleLoop_Impl, or functions that eventually call them \u2014 these are asynchronous call edges that can produce indirect recursion and therefore must be inspected.\n- timebase/timer thread functions that perform sigwait (e.g., the dedicated timebase thread entry points): the comment mentions a dedicated thread doing sigwait on RT signals; you need these symbols to verify they do not call into OS_IdleLoop/OS_IdleLoop_Impl or otherwise create cycles.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols (their definitions and call relationships) is sufficient to determine whether any direct or indirect call path creates recursion involving OS_IdleLoop_Impl."
