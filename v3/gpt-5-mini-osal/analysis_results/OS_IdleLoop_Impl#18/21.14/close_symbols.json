  "explanation": "To check the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must be sure no memcmp is invoked (directly or indirectly) from the target function or via identifiers/macros used in it. Specifically:\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: the global symbol referenced in the call must be inspected to ensure it is not a function-like macro or wrapper that invokes memcmp or performs a string comparison when evaluated.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: the actual declaration/initializer of this member must be examined to verify it is a plain sigset (or similar) and not computed by code that might call memcmp on strings.\n- sigset_t: the member's type confirms the semantics of the expression &POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask; if the type is an alias to some struct or wrapper with side effects, that could hide string comparisons.\n- sigsuspend: the called function might be a macro or project wrapper; inspect its declaration/definition to ensure it does not call memcmp (or expand to code that does) \u2014 an indirect call would still be relevant to the target function's compliance.\n- memcmp: include the standard declaration and check for any project redefinitions/aliases so you can detect any use of memcmp (direct or indirect) and determine whether it is used on null-terminated strings.\n- Any project macros/inline wrappers that expand POSIX_GlobalVars, NormalSigMask, or sigsuspend: preprocessor-level expansions can hide calls to memcmp or string comparisons. The next agent must see these definitions to rule out hidden memcmp usage.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions, typedefs, and relevant macros/wrappers) allows the analyzer to confirm there is no direct or indirect use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings from within OS_IdleLoop_Impl."
