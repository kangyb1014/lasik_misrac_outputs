  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided function contains only signal-handling code (a call to sigsuspend with POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask) and does not use any string or memory-comparison functions (no memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or other standard-library string routines). Therefore there are no locations in this snippet where memcmp could be used to compare null-terminated strings and nothing here needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
