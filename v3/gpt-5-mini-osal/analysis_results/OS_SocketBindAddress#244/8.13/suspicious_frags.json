  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter Addr is already const-qualified (so its declaration is fine); the direct reads of stream->socket_domain and stream->stream_state are read-only checks (they do not indicate missing const qualification of the pointer types); stream->stream_state is explicitly modified (stream->stream_state |= OS_STREAM_STATE_BOUND) and record->name_entry is assigned to (record->name_entry = ...), so those pointees are intentionally mutable and should not be const. The token variable is passed to object-management APIs that conventionally modify or manage the token, so its pointer usage is expected to be non-const. The listed fragments are points where pointer types, pointer-returning macros, or pointer-to-object assignments/calls could conceal a const-qualification mismatch (e.g. passing Addr to callees, obtaining object pointers via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, or assigning string/name pointers) and therefore should be investigated further for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
