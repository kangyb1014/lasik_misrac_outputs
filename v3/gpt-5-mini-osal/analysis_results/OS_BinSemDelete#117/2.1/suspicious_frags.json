  "explanation": "I inspected all provided functions and related symbols for code that cannot be executed under any possible program flow and found none:\n\n- OS_BinSemDelete: The only conditional (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)) depends on the runtime result of OS_ObjectIdGetById, so both the true and false paths are reachable depending on the call result. There is no code placed after an unconditional return in the same block that would be unreachable.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: The early return on a failed OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit is a legitimate runtime exit; the subsequent code is reachable when the init succeeds. The later conditional (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)) and the cleanup on failure (if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) { OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token); }) are runtime-dependent and not statically unreachable.\n\n- OS_BinSemDelete_Impl: The two branches depend on the return value of pthread_cond_destroy; either branch may occur at runtime. The pthread_mutex_destroy call is in the success branch and therefore reachable when the condition variable destruction succeeds.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: The branches based on operation_status (success vs non-success) depend on the argument passed in; both are potentially reachable. The unconditional call to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and the conditional OS_NotifyEvent are reachable per their respective conditions.\n\n- Macros and typedefs shown (e.g., OS_SUCCESS == 0, osal_id_t typedef) do not introduce constant-true/false conditions that would render code unreachable; comparisons to OS_SUCCESS are against runtime-returned values.\n\nGiven these points, there are no obvious unreachable statements or branches in the supplied code fragments that warrant further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
