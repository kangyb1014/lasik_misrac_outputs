  "explanation": "No suspicious language extensions detected. The function uses only standard C constructs: a typedef-based return type (int32 from int32_t), a standard function definition, a multi-line comment, and a macro-based return value (OS_SUCCESS defined as 0). There are no compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or any vendor-specific keywords or pragmas in the provided code or related symbol definitions. The typedef 'typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t' and the macro definition are standard C and do not constitute language extensions, so no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
