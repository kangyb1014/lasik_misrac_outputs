  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is unreachable you must trace incoming calls and the control flow that leads to the call site(s):\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize: direct caller of the target. Inspect its source to see if (and under what conditions) it calls OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl; the call could be inside a conditional or after early returns making the target unreachable.\n- OS_mkfs, OS_initfs: callers of OS_FileSys_Initialize. Determine whether these entry points are themselves reachable from program startup or other entry points; if they are never invoked the whole chain (and thus the target) may be unreachable.\n- OS_printf, OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl, OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew: functions called within OS_FileSys_Initialize. Their return values, side-effects, or presence of early-failure paths in OS_FileSys_Initialize can affect whether execution reaches the call to OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl. You need their implementations (or at least their documented return/side-effect behaviors) to determine whether the branch to the target is actually reachable.\n\n(Only these symbols are required to establish reachability of the target via the provided static call graph; other unrelated symbols such as simple return macros do not affect whether the function is reachable.)"
