  "explanation": "1) memcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule specifically forbids use of the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. To determine if the target function violates the rule you must know whether memcmp is invoked (directly) in the function body. 2) any preprocessor macro or wrapper that maps to memcmp (e.g. bcmp, OS_memcmp, or project-specific memcmp aliases) \u2014 memcmp might be hidden behind a macro or a project wrapper. These symbols must be checked because a call that does not literally name \"memcmp\" could still invoke the same behavior and thus violate the rule if used to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings. 3) <string.h> (declaration of memcmp) \u2014 the header where memcmp is declared; checking included headers and their contents can reveal declarations, macros, or inline/wrapper implementations that effectively call memcmp. Reviewing these symbols is sufficient for the target function because the function body contains no other calls; if none of these symbols are present or referenced in the function (or via macros), then the function cannot violate the memcmp rule."
