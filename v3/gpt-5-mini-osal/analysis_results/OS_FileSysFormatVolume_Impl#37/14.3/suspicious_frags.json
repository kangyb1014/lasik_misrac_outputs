  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function body contains only a comment block and a single return statement returning the constant OS_SUCCESS; there are no controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional operator) whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The parameter token is unused but does not introduce any control expression. The provided related definitions (OS_SUCCESS macro and the typedef) do not introduce hidden control flow. Therefore there are no places in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
