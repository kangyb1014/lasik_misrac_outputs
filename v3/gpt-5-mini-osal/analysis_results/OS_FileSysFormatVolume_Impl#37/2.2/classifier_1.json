Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * In theory, this should wipe any existing files in the ramdisk,\n     * but since ramdisks here are implemented using a directory within a tmpfs,\n     * removal of such files could be risky if something goes wrong,\n     * because it might remove files that were important.\n     *\n     * So the safest option is just a no-op.\n     * (this is also backward compatible since POSIX mkfs was always a no-op)\n     */\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl:\nint32 OS_FileSys_Initialize(char *address, const char *fsdevname, const char *fsvolname, size_t blocksize,\n                            osal_blockcount_t numblocks, bool should_format)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"address\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly null.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsdevname, sizeof(filesys->device_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n\n    /* check names are not empty strings */\n    if (fsdevname[0] == 0 || fsvolname[0] == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_FS_ERR_PATH_INVALID;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, fsdevname, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n        OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, filesys, device_name, fsdevname);\n\n        /* populate the VolumeName and BlockSize ahead of the Impl call,\n         * so the implementation can reference this info if necessary */\n        filesys->blocksize = blocksize;\n        filesys->numblocks = numblocks;\n        filesys->address   = address;\n        strncpy(filesys->volume_name, fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name) - 1);\n\n        /*\n         * Determine basic type of filesystem, if not already known\n         *\n         * if either an address was supplied, or if the volume name\n         * contains the string \"RAM\" then it is a RAM disk.
