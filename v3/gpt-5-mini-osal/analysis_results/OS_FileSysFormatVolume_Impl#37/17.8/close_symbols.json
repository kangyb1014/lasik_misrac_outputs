  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t: You must see the typedef/struct definition to know the actual type shape. If OS_object_token_t itself is a pointer type (e.g. typedef void * OS_object_token_t) then the parameter declaration const OS_object_token_t *token has different const binding and pointer-depth semantics; knowing the real type is necessary to decide whether operations that look like pointer assignments would actually modify the parameter (the pointer variable) or the object it points to.\\n\\nOS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (declaration/prototype): The full external declaration (as seen in headers) confirms the exact parameter type and placement of const qualifiers as exposed to callers (and any function-like attributes or macro decorations that could change the signature). This ensures the analysis uses the same signature binding rules (which determine what is allowed to be modified) as the compiled program.\\n\\nOS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol. Although the body shown simply returns OS_SUCCESS, the symbol could be a macro or expression that (in pathological headers) expands to something referring to parameters or side effects. Inspecting its definition ensures the return statement does not implicitly modify the parameter."
