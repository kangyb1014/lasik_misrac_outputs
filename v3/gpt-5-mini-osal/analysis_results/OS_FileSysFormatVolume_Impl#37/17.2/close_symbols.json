  "explanation": "MISRA checks for direct or indirect self-calls (cycles that include the target). To decide if OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl violates this rule you must inspect any functions that can call it and any functions they call (because an indirect cycle could occur through those paths). Required symbols and reasons:\n\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize: Direct caller of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (must be examined for any path that returns/control-transfers back to the target).\n- OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl: Called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; it could call back to OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (forming an indirect recursion) or call other functions that do.\n- OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl: Same reason as StartVolume \u2014 it is invoked by OS_FileSys_Initialize and could be part of a cycle.\n- OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew: Called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; object-id management routines can call into other filesystem helpers and might introduce a cycle.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: As above \u2014 called by OS_FileSys_Initialize and may call other helpers that could reach the target.\n- OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken: Same rationale \u2014 part of the call subtree of OS_FileSys_Initialize.\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew: Same rationale \u2014 part of the call subtree and may trigger callbacks into filesystem code.\n- OS_printf: Called by OS_FileSys_Initialize; included for completeness because it is in the immediate callee list (although it is unlikely to create recursion, it must be ruled out).\n- OS_mkfs: Caller of OS_FileSys_Initialize \u2014 include to detect cycles that span upward callers (a recursion cycle could involve higher-level callers).\n- OS_initfs: Same as OS_mkfs \u2014 a caller of OS_FileSys_Initialize that could participate in a larger cycle.\n\nIn short: start from the direct caller (OS_FileSys_Initialize) and analyze its entire callee subtree (the listed symbols) plus the callers of OS_FileSys_Initialize to ensure there is no path that returns to OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl."
