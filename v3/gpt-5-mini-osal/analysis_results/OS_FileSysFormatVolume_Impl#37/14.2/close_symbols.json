The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns OS_SUCCESS. To be certain there are no hidden for-loops or side effects that could violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rules, the definition of OS_SUCCESS must be inspected (it may be a macro, enum constant, or expression). If it is a macro it could conceivably expand to code containing loops or side-effecting expressions, so its definition is required.  \n- OS_object_token_t: This type appears in the function signature. Although a type normally cannot contain executable code, it might be a macro alias or use attributes/macro magic that expands to code (or reference inline functions) which could contain loops or side effects. Inspecting its definition ensures the function prototype does not hide any code (macros or inline constructs) that could introduce for loops or affect loop-counter usage.  \n\nNo other symbols (callers or other functions) are required because the function body contains no calls or local loops; MISRA\u2019s requirement to include behavior of functions called within a for-loop body does not apply here as there are no callees."
