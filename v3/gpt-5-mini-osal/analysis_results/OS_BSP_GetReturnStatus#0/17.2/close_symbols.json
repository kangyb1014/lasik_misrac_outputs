  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect all functions that call it and the entire reachable call graph from those callers: \n\n- main: main is a direct caller of OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus (per the static call graph). Provide main's definition to check whether main calls OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus more than once, calls other functions that in turn could call back, or registers callbacks that might call OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus.\n\n- OS_BSP_Initialize: main calls this function. Its body must be checked to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus or calls other functions that could lead back to main or OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus, creating an indirect recursion cycle.\n\n- OS_Application_Startup: main calls this function. Provide its definition to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus or any function that can call main or other callers, forming a recursion path.\n\n- OS_Application_Run: main calls this function. Its implementation may spawn tasks, register callbacks, or call other functions that could call OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus (directly or via a chain). You must inspect it and its callees.\n\n- Any function-pointer variables / callback registration symbols referenced by main or the above functions: Indirect calls via function pointers, callbacks, interrupt service registrations, or created threads/tasks can form indirect recursion even if static direct calls do not show it. Provide the symbols (definitions/declarations) for any function-pointer variables, callback registration APIs used, and the target callback functions so their call behavior can be analyzed.\n\nIn short, to prove absence of direct or indirect self-calls you need the full bodies (or at least their call targets) of main and every function it calls (and any callbacks/function-pointer targets they register or invoke)."
