  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyst must confirm that the function does not (directly or indirectly) perform such comparisons and that the data it manipulates are not string objects. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The target function reads a global object named OS_BSP_Global; its full definition is required to see whether any macros/inline functions or unusual operators could expand into or call memcmp, and to locate the AppStatus field.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (field/type/definition): You must know the type of AppStatus (e.g., enum, integer, pointer, char array, char*) to ensure the switch is operating on a non-string scalar. If AppStatus were some string type or alias to a pointer-to-char, it would change the analysis with respect to string comparison rules.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: The symbolic values used in the switch must be checked to ensure they are scalar constants (not macros that expand to string comparisons or expressions that invoke memcmp indirectly).\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE: These are standard library macros mapped to integer exit codes. Including their definitions ensures the translation performed by the function is scalar-to-scalar and not hiding any string operations.\n\n- memcmp (declaration in <string.h>): The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings. The analyst must verify that memcmp is not invoked (directly in this function, via macros, or by any inline/expanded code reachable from the function). Having memcmp as a close symbol lets the analyzer search for direct/indirect references or aliases to it.\n\n(Other symbols such as callers or unrelated functions are not required because the static call graph shows this function has no callees; the primary risk to the MISRA rule would be any use/expansion of memcmp or AppStatus being a string type, both covered by the symbols above.)"
