  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions it relies on. Specifically:\n- OS_BSP_Global (and the header that declares it): the global may carry compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (section, visibility, alignment, etc.) that are language/compiler extensions.\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus and its type/enum/typedef definition: if AppStatus is a bit-field, uses a non-standard underlying type, or is declared with attributes (or an implementation-defined enum underlying type), those could be compiler extensions or implementation-defined behavior relevant to MISRA\u2019s rule.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR definitions: these may be macros or enum constants; their definitions could use compiler extensions (non-standard integer constants, casts, or attributes).\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE (and <stdlib.h> or any project override): although standardized, a project could override these with non-standard definitions or macros that use extensions; you must inspect their concrete definitions.\n- The header files that declare/define the above: pragmas or header-level compiler directives can introduce extensions (e.g., diagnostic pragmas, packing pragmas).\n- Any compiler-specific attribute/extension macros or pragmas referenced in the above declarations: names like __attribute__, __packed, __declspec, pragmas, or custom macros that expand to compiler-specific constructs must be checked to determine whether language extensions are used.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows the next analyst to see if any non-standard language features, attributes, or compiler-specific constructs are present in the types/macros used by the function."
