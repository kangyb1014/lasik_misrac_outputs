  "explanation": "To decide whether the switch controlling expression 'OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus' is invariant (and thus whether the code violates MISRA C rule about invariant controlling expressions) the analyzer needs information beyond the single function:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global (variable definition/declaration): The full declaration (not just its use) is required to know storage class (extern/static), linkage and whether it is a compile-time constant object.\n\n- type/struct of OS_BSP_Global: The struct/typedef that declares the AppStatus member is needed to see AppStatus's declared type (enum/int/uint8_t/etc.) and semantics that affect whether its value can vary.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (declaration: type and qualifiers): Crucial to know whether AppStatus is declared const (would make it invariant) or volatile (indicates it can change asynchronously), and its integer width/signedness (relevant for evaluating whether the expression is an integer constant expression).\n\n- initial/static initializer of OS_BSP_Global: If AppStatus is initialized to a constant and never modified, the controlling expression could be invariant; the initializer and whether it is modified later must be known.\n\n- All functions that write OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (e.g. OS_BSP_Initialize, OS_Application_Startup, OS_Application_Run, and any other writer functions): To establish that AppStatus is not invariant at runtime the analyzer must see whether other functions in the program (including those called from main) assign to or modify AppStatus. The listed callers in the static call graph are starting points; their definitions must be inspected for assignments.\n\n- All interrupt service routines or callbacks that write OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus: Even if no normal function writes AppStatus, ISRs or other asynchronous writers can change it at runtime; their presence or absence affects whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR (macro/enum definitions): While these do not determine invariance themselves, their definitions establish whether the switch labels are valid and may indicate AppStatus is an enumeration type (affecting constness/semantic interpretation).\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE (macro definitions): Not required to determine invariance, but included for completeness of semantic analysis of the function's return translation (they are compile-time constants and do not affect the controlling expression)."
