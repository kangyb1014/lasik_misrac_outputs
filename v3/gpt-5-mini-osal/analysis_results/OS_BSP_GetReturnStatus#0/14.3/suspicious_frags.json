  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions. The only controlling expression in this function is the switch header (switch (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus)); it must be investigated to ensure OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus is not effectively invariant (e.g. declared const, a compile-time constant, or never modified at run-time). Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule: the case labels are constant literals/enumerators (they are not controlling expressions), the assignments to retcode (including the masking expression retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F) are ordinary expressions not controlling statements, and the return statement is not a controlling expression. There are no loops or if-statements here whose controlling expressions could be invariant, so no other locations are relevant to Rule 14.3 in this function."
