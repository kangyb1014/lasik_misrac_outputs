  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the function. Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of those standard string-handling functions and whether they may access beyond the bounds of the objects passed to them. This code performs direct byte-wise access via a pointer (const uint8 *Byte_ptr) and an explicit loop index; while out-of-bounds indexing of Byte_ptr could still be a general safety concern, it is not a use of any <string.h> routine and therefore is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. For the purposes of Rule 21.17, there are no fragments to investigate in this function."
