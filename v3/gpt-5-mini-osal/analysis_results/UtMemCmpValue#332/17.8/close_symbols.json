  "explanation": "You must know the exact definitions of the integer and boolean types used in the function because their typedefs/macros can change the semantics relevant to the MISRA rule about modifying parameters.\n\n- bool: Determine whether this is the standard boolean type (e.g. from stdbool.h) or a macro/typedef that expands to a different type (int, macro expression, etc.). If bool were a macro with side effects, it could affect whether the function is considered to modify a parameter or return type semantics.\n\n- uint8: This is used in the pointer declaration (const uint8 *Byte_ptr) and in the Value parameter. If uint8 is a typedef to a simple integer type (e.g. unsigned char) the code is a plain pointer-to-byte read. If uint8 were (unexpectedly) a pointer type, array type, or included qualifiers (volatile, const) in its definition, that would change whether the function modifies the pointer parameter or the object pointed to. Knowing the exact typedef/definition is required to judge whether any assignment or access modifies the parameter object or the parameter value.\n\n- uint32: Used for the Length parameter and loop control. If uint32 is an alias for some non-scalar or special type (e.g. a struct, volatile-qualified type, or a macro that evaluates with side effects), loop control and comparisons could have different side effects relevant to parameter modification.\n\nIn short: verify the actual typedef/macro definitions of these symbols to confirm that (a) Memory is indeed a pointer to object data (const void *), (b) assigning Memory to a local const uint8 * does not strip qualifiers or perform an implicit modification of the parameter, and (c) none of the used types/macros introduce hidden side effects that would violate the MISRA rule (modifying a parameter)."
