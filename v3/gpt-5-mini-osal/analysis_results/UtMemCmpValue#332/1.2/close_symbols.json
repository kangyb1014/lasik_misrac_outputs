  "explanation": "- bool / true / false: determine whether these are the standard C99/_Bool and stdbool.h macros/keywords or whether the project/compiler provides them via a non\u2011standard extension (e.g. a compiler keyword, macro or typedef). MISRA language\u2011extension checks must know the actual definition/source of these symbols.\\n- uint8: inspect the typedef/definition to see if it is a plain standard type (e.g. typedef uint8_t or unsigned char) or implemented with a compiler extension (e.g. __int8, compiler-specific attributes or non\u2011standard width types).\\n- uint32: same reason as uint8 \u2014 the typedef/definition must be examined to ensure it does not rely on a compiler language extension.\\n(Short rationale: the function body itself uses only standard C constructs; any possible violation of the MISRA rule would come from the definitions/headers that introduce these identifiers, so those symbol definitions must be provided.)"
