  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. Every statement in the function is exercised in some calls and is necessary for correct behavior:\n\n- The declaration and use of the loop index (uint32 i) are required to control iteration; removing it would change or prevent the loop.\n- The pointer assignment (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory) is used to access the bytes; removing it would alter how Memory is accessed and thus change behavior.\n- The for loop and its condition (i < Length) are required to iterate over the buffer; removing the loop body or loop would change behavior whenever Length > 0.\n- The if test and the early return (return false) are necessary to indicate a mismatch; removing them would change the function result in mismatch cases.\n- The final return true is necessary to return success when no mismatch is found.\n\nNote also that cases where the loop body is not executed (Length == 0) are instances of non-executed code due to runtime conditions (unreachable for that invocation) \u2014 per the MISRA note, unreachable code is not classified as dead code. Initialization vs assignment distinctions are not applicable here in a way that would cause dead code. Therefore there are no operations that are executed but could be removed without affecting program behavior."
