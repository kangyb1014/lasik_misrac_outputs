  "explanation": "Provide the project/header definitions for these symbols so the MISRA check can determine the actual underlying types and qualifiers:\n\n- uint8: The typedef (or macro) that defines uint8 is required to know whether uint8 is an unsigned integer type, a pointer type, or already const-qualified. If uint8 is itself a pointer typedef or contains const, the meaning of 'const uint8 *' and whether the pointer actually points to a const-qualified object can change.\n\n- uint32: The typedef for uint32 is required to confirm Length's type. While not a pointer, its actual definition can affect analysis of loop indexing and whether any implicit conversions or typedef-qualified-const interactions exist in the function.\n\n- bool: The definition/typedef for bool (e.g., from stdbool.h or a project typedef) is required to confirm the return type and to ensure true/false semantics are the standard boolean values; this is needed to fully understand whether returning false/true interacts with any custom boolean typedefs that might carry qualifiers.\n\n- true / false: The macro/enum definitions for true and false are required to verify they map to the expected boolean values and are not redefined in a way that could affect const-related analysis.\n\nIn short: the typedefs/macros that define uint8, uint32, bool, and the true/false symbols must be known so you can accurately determine whether the pointer declarations (const void *Memory and const uint8 *Byte_ptr) actually result in pointers to const-qualified object types or are affected by underlying typedefs that change constness or introduce pointer types."
