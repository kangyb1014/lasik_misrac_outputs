  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. UtMemCmpValue contains no function calls (it only performs pointer access and comparisons), so it cannot be directly call itself. Indirect recursion can only occur via functions it calls; since there are no outgoing calls from UtMemCmpValue, there are no callees to inspect for indirect recursion. The integer/boolean typedefs (bool, uint8, uint32) and the parameter types do not affect the call graph and are irrelevant for determining violations of the MISRA rule."
