  "explanation": "No function in the supplied code modifies any of its parameters. Specifically:\n- OS_IdleLoop has no parameters.\n- OS_IdleLoop_Impl is declared with void (no parameters) and only calls sigsuspend with the address of a global; no parameter reassignment occurs.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler takes FuncKey, FunctionName and DefaultHandler and only reads/uses them (comparisons, passing them to other functions). There are no assignments to any parameter variables, nor are pointer parameters reassigned. The global initializer and macro definitions are not function parameters and therefore not relevant to Rule 17.8. Hence there are no suspect fragments to investigate for this rule."
