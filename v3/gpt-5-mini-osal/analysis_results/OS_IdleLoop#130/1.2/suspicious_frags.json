  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided code for constructs that are known compiler language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, typeof, nonstandard inline/asm keywords, GNU designated-expression syntax beyond standard C, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other documented compiler-specific extensions). None of those are present. Specific checks performed:\n\n- Function definitions and while loop: standard C; not an extension.\n- sigsuspend/signal-related calls: POSIX API calls (library/OS API), not a compiler language extension.\n- Hex literal (0xABADC0DE) and macros: standard C preprocessor/literal usage.\n- Designated initializers (e.g. .GlobalState = 0): these are standard since C99, not a compiler extension per se. (If your build targets an older non-C99 compiler that documents designated initializers as an extension, then that would need review \u2014 but in mainstream C99/C11/C17 compilers this is standard.)\n- Use of NULL, bool/true/false: standard C (stdbool.h) or common standard macros; not compiler extensions.\n- Preprocessor conditional (#if defined(...)): standard preprocessor feature.\n\nNo compiler-specific keywords or builtins (such as identifiers beginning with double underscores that are documented as extensions) were found. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the supplied code."
