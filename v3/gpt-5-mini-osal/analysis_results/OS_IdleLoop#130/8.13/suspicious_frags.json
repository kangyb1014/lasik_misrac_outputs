  "explanation": "No pointer usage appears in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- The function signature 'void OS_IdleLoop()' has no pointer parameters or return type.\n- The while condition 'OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER' compares scalar values (no pointers or address operations).\n- The call 'OS_IdleLoop_Impl();' is a plain function call with no arguments here (no pointer expressions or conversions in this translation unit).\n\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and const qualification. Because there are no pointer declarations, pointer expressions, address-of operators, casts involving pointers, or pointer parameters/returns in the shown code, there are no code fragments within this snippet that need investigation for Rule 8.13. (If the definitions or prototypes of OS_IdleLoop_Impl or OS_SharedGlobalVars are located elsewhere and contain pointer usages, those should be inspected in their respective translation units \u2014 they are not part of the provided code and therefore were not flagged.)"
