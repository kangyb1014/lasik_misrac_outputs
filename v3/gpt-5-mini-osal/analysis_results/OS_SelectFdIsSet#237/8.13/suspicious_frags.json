  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameter in this function is Set and it is already const-qualified (const OS_FdSet *Set), satisfying the rule. The use of &local_id passes the address of a local variable to an API that presumably writes an output value; that pointer cannot be const because it is intentionally an output parameter. Access to Set->object_ids is a read-only access through a const-qualified pointer, so there is no non-const pointer that could be made const. The BUGCHECK macro is used to check Set for NULL and does not change qualification of the pointer. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 8.13."
