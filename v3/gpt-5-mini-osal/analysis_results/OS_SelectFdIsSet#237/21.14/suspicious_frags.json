  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp or any other string-comparison standard library function are present in the provided code fragment. The function operates on integer/bitset data (object_ids array, local_id) and performs bitwise/index operations; there are no char pointers, string literals, or null-terminated string handling in this snippet. The only calls/macros present (BUGCHECK and OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex) do not show any string comparisons here; their implementations would need separate review, but they are not part of this code fragment and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.14 for this snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for the memcmp string-comparison violation."
