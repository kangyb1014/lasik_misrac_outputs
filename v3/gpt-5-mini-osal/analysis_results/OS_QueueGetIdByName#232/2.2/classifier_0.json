  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_QueueGetIdByName:\n```c\nint32 OS_QueueGetIdByName(osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, queue_name, queue_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_QueueGetIdByName:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindByName(osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, osal_id_t *object_id)\n{\n    int32             return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n\n    /*\n     * As this is an internal-only function, calling it with NULL is allowed.\n     * This is required by the file/dir/socket API since these DO allow multiple\n     * instances of the same name.\n     */\n    ARGCHECK(name, OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND);\n    LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, OS_ERR_NAME_TOO_LONG);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, idtype, name, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        *object_id = token.obj_id;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(lock_mode, idtype, OS_ObjectNameMatch, (void *)name, token);\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdRelease(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, NULL);\n}\n...\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE - 1;\n        }\n\n        msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0;\n\n        OS_ConsoleWrite(OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfConsoleId, msg_buffer);\n    }\n}\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_id_t\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_id);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_id) macro expands to BUGCHECK((queue_id)!=NULL, OS_INVALID_POINTER). If queue_id is NULL the BUGCHECK invocation will perform error handling (e.g. signal the error/abort/return). Removing this check would allow OS_ObjectIdFindByName to be called with a NULL object pointer, changing program behaviour (potentially causing a later dereference/undefined behaviour). Therefore this check is not dead code."
