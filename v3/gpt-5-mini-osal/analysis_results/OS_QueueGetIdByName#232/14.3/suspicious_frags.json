  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (typically loop controls like while(1), for(;;), or do ... while(constant)) that are not allowed except for the stated exceptions (intentional infinite loops or the do { ... } while(0) macro idiom covered by the exception). The provided OS_QueueGetIdByName function contains no loop constructs \u2014 only two parameter-check macros and a single call that returns a value. The related code shown (OS_printf and OS_ObjectIdFindByName) contains conditional statements whose controlling expressions depend on runtime values (globals, function results or local variables) and therefore are not invariant: - OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER depends on a global variable - OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled depends on a global variable - actualsz checks depend on the result of vsnprintf - return_code == OS_SUCCESS depends on a function result The macros shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER -> BUGCHECK(...), ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) may expand to conditional checks or to the common do { ... } while(0) macro form; the latter is explicitly allowed by the rule exceptions. No loop with a constant/invariant controlling expression appears in the supplied code, and no suspicious invariant controlling expressions were found, so there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
