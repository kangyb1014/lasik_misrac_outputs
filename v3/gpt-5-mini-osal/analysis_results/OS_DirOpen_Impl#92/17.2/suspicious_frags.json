  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided code exhibit direct or indirect self-calls. The only function calls in OS_DirOpen_Impl are:\n- opendir(local_path) \u2014 a standard library function, not calling back into OS_DirOpen_Impl.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token) which expands to &OS_impl_dir_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&( *token ))]. This only invokes the inline accessor OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *), which simply returns token->obj_idx and performs no function calls.\nThere are no function pointers, callbacks, or other calls in the snippet that could form an indirect recursion chain to OS_DirOpen_Impl. The global array OS_impl_dir_table and the struct assignment impl->dp = dp are data operations, not function calls. Therefore, based on the provided code and related definitions, there are no suspicious fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self-calls). If additional code (e.g. other functions, callbacks, or function-pointer tables) exists elsewhere in the project, those should be checked for potential indirect recursion, but they were not part of the supplied code."
