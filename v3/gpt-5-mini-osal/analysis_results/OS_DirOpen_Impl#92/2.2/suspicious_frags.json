  "explanation": "No executed operations in the provided code constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Specific reasoning: \n\n- OS_DirOpen_Impl: calling opendir(local_path) is required to obtain a DIR* that is subsequently stored in impl->dp. The check for dp == NULL affects return behaviour, and impl->dp = dp is used by other functions (read/close/rewind). Removing any of these operations would change program behaviour.\n\n- OS_DirRead_Impl: readdir(impl->dp) produces the directory entry used immediately; the NULL check affects return behaviour. The strncpy and explicit terminating byte both affect the produced FileName and therefore observable behaviour. The comment and cppcheck-suppress annotations are non-executable and not dead code.\n\n- OS_DirClose_Impl: closedir(impl->dp) performs resource release; setting impl->dp = NULL updates shared state to prevent future use of a stale pointer. Both operations are observable and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- OS_DirRewind_Impl: rewinddir(impl->dp) changes the directory stream position; it is observable and not removable.\n\n- Macros and helpers: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are required to map a token to the table entry; removing their use would change behaviour. The external table declaration and structure fields are referenced by the functions above and are therefore live.\n\nNo unreachable code fragments are present in the supplied snippets. Consequently there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation under Rule 2.2."
