  "explanation": "No other code fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. There are no assignments to the parameter variables (timer_prop or timer_id) in this function \u2014 the pointer variable timer_prop is never reassigned, incremented, or otherwise modified. The uses of timer_prop in memset(timer_prop, ...), strncpy(timer_prop->name, ...), and the subsequent field stores modify the object pointed-to by timer_prop, which is explicitly permitted by the rule. All other operations (object lookups, token handling, local variable assignments, and OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token)) do not modify the function parameters themselves and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 17.8."
