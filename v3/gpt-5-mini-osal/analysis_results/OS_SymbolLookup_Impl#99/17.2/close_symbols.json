  "explanation": "To prove the target does not (directly or indirectly) call itself you must examine the transitive callees invoked from OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and any functions they call that could call back to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl. Each listed symbol is required for that inspection:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee of the target. Its body must be checked to ensure it does not call OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (direct recursion) or call other functions that eventually do.\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Called to initialize the iterator; its implementation may invoke other routines (or callbacks) that could lead back to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIterateActive (appears in static graph). Inspecting it is necessary because it may call further functions that could form an indirect recursion chain.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext: Used in the target's iteration loop (called in source). It must be checked because its behavior might invoke callbacks or other lookups that could reach OS_SymbolLookup_Impl.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Direct callee of the target (cleanup). Its implementation (and the functions it calls) must be scanned for any call path back to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy (per graph). Included because it could call further routines that cause an indirect recursive call.\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee invoked per-module in the loop. Its implementation must be checked for any call path back to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (including via other helpers).\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (per graph). Included because it may call other services which could eventually lead to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl.\n\nTogether these symbols form the immediate transitive closure of functions reachable from OS_SymbolLookup_Impl in the provided static call graph; examining their bodies (and any additional callees they contain) is required to rule out indirect recursion."
