  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. The code uses standard C constructs: typedefs of standard integer types (uintptr_t, int32_t), the standard bool type, normal function definitions and calls, standard pointer and macro usage (NULL, hex literal 0x0A), pre/post increment, loops, and breaks. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__ or __declspec, inline assembly (__asm__), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, labels-as-values, GNU __builtin_ functions, or other documented compiler-specific keywords or syntactic extensions. The only macro-like identifiers invoked (e.g. OS_ObjectIdIterateActive) are not defined in the supplied code, so no extension usage can be inferred from their use; based on the visible code, nothing requires investigation for Rule 1.2."
