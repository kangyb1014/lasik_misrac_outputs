The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function (OS_SymbolLookup_Impl) causes or participates in any for-loop MISRA C violations you must inspect not only the target but any functions it calls (and their callees) because the MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. The following symbols are therefore required for analysis:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee; inspect for any for-loops and whether their clauses or called subfunctions violate the rule (e.g., modify objects other than the loop counter).\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee; it itself calls other functions and may contain for-loops whose body or clauses must be checked.\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Direct callee used to start the iterator; it calls OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit and may contain loops or side effects relevant to loop-clauses or loop-body analysis.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIterateActive; must be checked for loops or side effects that could affect loop counters or objects used in loop clauses.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext: Called in the while-condition inside the target; although not listed in the provided call graph it appears in the source \u2014 its implementation must be checked because any for-loops it contains or side effects it performs are part of loop behaviour.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Direct callee; it calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel and may contain loops or modify objects that interact with loop counters/flags in surrounding code.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy; must be checked transitively for for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA rule compliance.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; included because ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl calls it and it may contain for-loops or side effects that affect compliance.\n\nInspecting the above symbols (their implementations and any for-loops they contain) provides the necessary context to determine whether any for-loop visible from or invoked by OS_SymbolLookup_Impl is well-formed per the MISRA rule (i.e., clause side-effects, loop-counter usage, and modifications in loop bodies)."
