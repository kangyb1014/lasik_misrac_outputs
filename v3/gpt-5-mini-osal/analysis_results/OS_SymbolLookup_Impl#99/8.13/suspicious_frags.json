  "explanation": "The pointers not listed were not flagged because they either already use const where appropriate or are used for output/modification and thus must be non-const. Specifically:\n- All occurrences of SymbolAddress are output parameters (cpuaddr *SymbolAddress) that are written to (*SymbolAddress = ...) and therefore should not be const.\n- SymbolName parameters are already const-qualified (const char *SymbolName) and need no change.\n- The token parameter in OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl is already const (const OS_object_token_t *token).\n- The OS_ObjectIdIterator functions and the local iter variable modify the iterator state (e.g., iter->token.obj_idx, iter->token.obj_id), so the iterator pointer cannot be const.\n- The dlsym() API returns a void * and the returned pointer is stored in Function and cast to cpuaddr; making Function const would be inappropriate given the interaction with the non-const external API.\nThus the listed fragments represent pointer usages where a const qualifier may be possible and should be investigated further for compliance with MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
