  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. First, the local variable 'Function' is declared in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, not in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (so the reported function is wrong). Second, while 'Function' is only used in a read-only fashion and could be declared as const void * for clarity, MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is a \u201cshould\u201d guideline (recommendation) \u2014 not a mandatory \u201cshall\u201d violation. Declaring it const is permissible but not required, and the existing code does not modify the pointed-to object via that pointer. (Casting the dlsym() result or later casting the pointer to cpuaddr is a separate concern but does not by itself make this a Rule 8.13 violation.) Therefore the agent\u2019s claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is incorrect."
