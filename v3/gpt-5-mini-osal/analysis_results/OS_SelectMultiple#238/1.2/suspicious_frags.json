  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. The function uses standard C constructs only: a typedef-like integer type name (int32) and pointer parameter types (OS_FdSet *), a local variable declaration, comments in /* ... */ form, a plain function call (OS_SelectMultiple_Impl), and a standard return statement. There are no GCC/Clang attributes, inline assembly, statement expressions, typeof, nested functions, zero-length or flexible array extensions, pragmas, or other vendor-specific extensions shown. The use of user-defined types (int32, OS_FdSet) is a standard C practice via typedefs and is not a compiler language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
