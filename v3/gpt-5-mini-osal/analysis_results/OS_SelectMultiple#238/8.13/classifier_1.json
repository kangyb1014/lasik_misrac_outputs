  "scenario": "The function takes pointer parameters ReadSet and WriteSet but does not modify the objects they point to (it simply forwards them to OS_SelectMultiple_Impl and returns). Since the pointers are used as input-only, they should be declared pointing-to-const (e.g. const OS_FdSet *ReadSet, const OS_FdSet *WriteSet). Therefore Rule 8.13 is violated."
