  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. In both OS_SelectMultiple and OS_SelectMultiple_Impl none of the formal parameters (ReadSet, WriteSet, msecs) are assigned to or otherwise modified as objects of automatic storage: there are no statements like ReadSet = ..., WriteSet = ..., or msecs = .... Pointer parameters are only tested for NULL and passed to helper functions (e.g. OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl, OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl, OS_DoSelect) which may modify the objects they point to \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no code fragments that appear to violate the requirement that the pointer parameters themselves must not be modified."
