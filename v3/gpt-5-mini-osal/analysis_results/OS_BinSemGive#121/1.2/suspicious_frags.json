  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The elements present are: a function definition, standard block-scoped local variable declarations, typedef-based names (int32, osal_id_t, OS_object_token_t) which are user-defined types and not compiler extensions, standard C comments, and ordinary function calls. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline (compiler-specific forms), __builtin_*, typeof, _Pragma with implementation-specific tokens, Microsoft __declspec, GCC statement-expressions, or other documented compiler-specific keywords or constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
