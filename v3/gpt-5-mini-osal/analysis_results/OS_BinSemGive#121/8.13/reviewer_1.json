In that case the prototype should be OS_BinSemGive_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token) so the pointer points to a const-qualified type. If, however, OS_BinSemGive_Impl intends to modify the token object, then a non-const pointer is required and there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nsem_id=3735928559, return_code=-1\nsem_id=3735928559, return_code=-35\nsem_id=0, return_code=-1\nsem_id=0, return_code=-35\n\n</execution_log>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's observation is conceptually correct (MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to object is not modified). However, whether the code actually violates the rule cannot be determined from the snippet alone: the rule applies to the function prototype/usage. If OS_BinSemGive_Impl is declared/defined to accept a non-const OS_object_token_t * but does not modify the pointed-to object, then the API should be changed to accept const OS_object_token_t * and the current code would violate the guidance. If, instead, OS_BinSemGive_Impl legitimately modifies the token (or the API intentionally requires a non-const pointer), then the non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no violation.\n\nTherefore the agent A's conditional scenario is accurate, but the assertion of a violation lacks the necessary information (the prototype/implementation of OS_BinSemGive_Impl). To resolve: inspect the prototype and implementation of OS_BinSemGive_Impl; if it does not modify the token, change its parameter to const OS_object_token_t * to comply with 8.13."
