  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), or nested functions.\n- There are no inline assembly statements, no compiler pragmas, and no vendor-specific keywords.\n- No variable-length arrays, designated initializers, or other non-standard constructs appear.\n- The code uses plain function calls, standard control flow, integer typedefs (int32 from int32_t) and ordinary macros/constants \u2014 all standard C.\n\nNote on the forward-declaration of OS_object_token_t: the snippet shows a typedef for struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t; this by itself is not a language extension (it is a standard forward declaration). Declaring a variable of that type (OS_object_token_t token;) is only valid if the struct is defined elsewhere; that is a code completeness concern but not a language-extension issue, so it was not flagged here."
