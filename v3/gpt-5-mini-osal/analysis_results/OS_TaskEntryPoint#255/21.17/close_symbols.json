  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_TaskEntryPoint can violate the MISRA rule about out-of-bounds string handling you must inspect not only OS_TaskEntryPoint itself (which only calls two routines), but the implementations of those routines and any functions they call that might invoke string.h functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memmove, memcmp, strlen, strspn, etc.) or operate on character buffers. Brief rationale for each listed symbol:\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare (implementation + prototype): OS_TaskEntryPoint only acts when this returns OS_SUCCESS and obtains the task_entry pointer from it. OS_TaskPrepare may copy task names/metadata or otherwise manipulate buffers (via strcpy/strncpy/memcpy), so its source is essential to see any string operations or buffer length checks.\n\n- OS_TaskExit (implementation + prototype): Called unconditionally at function end; its implementation or its callees may perform cleanup that uses string functions (clearing structures with memset, copying names, etc.).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent: These are direct callees of OS_TaskPrepare (per the call graph). Any of them might call standard string functions or manipulate name/payload buffers. You need their implementations to trace possible string operations and verify correct bounds usage and length arguments.\n\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_TaskDetach_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, OS_TaskExit_Impl, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: These are callees of OS_TaskExit (per the call graph). They must be inspected for uses of string.h functions or buffer operations that could go out-of-bounds during task exit processing.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: Although it looks like a unit-test or handler, it may process string payloads or events and call string functions \u2014 include its code to be safe.\n\n- typedef osal_task_entry: The type of the function pointer invoked ((*task_entry)()). Knowing its signature is needed in case the task entry receives arguments or a context pointer that could trigger string operations inside the task entry or influence how OS_TaskPrepare sets it up.\n\n- typedef osal_id_t: To understand the size/range and how object-id routines index into tables; some object-id helpers may use the id to index buffers and perform string ops based on computed sizes.\n\n- definition of OS_SUCCESS (enum/macro): To know the exact success value(s) used by OS_TaskPrepare and whether other return codes affect control flow and thus whether particular callees execute.\n\n- definitions of object/task record types and global object tables (e.g. OS_common_record_t, OS_task_record_t, OS_object_token_t): Many of the above functions likely operate on fields in these structures (name[] buffers, pointers to strings, event payload buffers). You must examine the struct definitions to identify buffer sizes and any string fields so you can check whether string.h calls use correct lengths and do not access beyond object bounds.\n\nIn short: include the full implementations (or at least prototypes plus bodies) of OS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit and every function they call (per the static call graph), plus the type definitions and record structures referenced by those implementations. Those are the places where calls to the standard string.h routines could occur and where buffer sizes and bounds checks must be verified for MISRA compliance."
