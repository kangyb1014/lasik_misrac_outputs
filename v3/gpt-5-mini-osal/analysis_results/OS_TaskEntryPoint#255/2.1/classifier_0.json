  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not introduce unreachable code: the check 'if (task_entry != NULL) { (*task_entry)(); }' is reachable and allows both calling the task entry and falling through to OS_TaskExit(). A violation could occur in a different situation \u2014 for example, if OS_TaskPrepare always supplies a non-NULL task_entry that points to a function declared or defined as non-returning (e.g. annotated with noreturn or implemented as an infinite loop), then the subsequent code (including OS_TaskExit()) would be unreachable. In the given code as shown there is no guaranteed unreachable code."
