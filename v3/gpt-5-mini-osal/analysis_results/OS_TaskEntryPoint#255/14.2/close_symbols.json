The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning (concise):\n- OS_TaskPrepare: called directly by OS_TaskEntryPoint; its implementation may contain for-loops or call other routines with for-loops. To verify MISRA for-loops you must inspect this function.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent: these are the transitive callees of OS_TaskPrepare (from the call graph). Any of them may contain for-loops or affect loop control objects used inside loops called from OS_TaskPrepare; they must be examined so that all loop bodies (including called functions) are checked for the MISRA requirements.\n- OS_TaskExit: called unconditionally at function end; its implementation may contain for-loops or call other routines with for-loops, so it must be inspected.\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_TaskDetach_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, OS_TaskExit_Impl, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: transitive callees of OS_TaskExit. Inspecting these is required because MISRA treats the behaviour of functions called from within loop bodies as part of the loop body; any for-loops in these routines must be verified.\n- osal_task_entry: the typedef/function-pointer type of task_entry. OS_TaskEntryPoint invokes (*task_entry)(); the actual task entry function(s) reachable via this pointer may contain for-loops. You need the type and the set of possible target functions (or at least their prototypes/implementations) to determine whether any for-loops called indirectly violate the rule.\n- OS_PthreadTaskEntry: the static caller of OS_TaskEntryPoint. Include for context (call-site) inspection if needed to understand how OS_TaskEntryPoint is used; while not strictly required to check for-loops inside OS_TaskEntryPoint, it may help locate task implementations or usage patterns.\n\nIn short: to determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule you must inspect OS_TaskEntryPoint plus all functions it calls directly and transitively (and the task entry function(s) invoked via the osal_task_entry pointer), because the rule requires considering the behaviour of any functions executed inside a for-loop body."
