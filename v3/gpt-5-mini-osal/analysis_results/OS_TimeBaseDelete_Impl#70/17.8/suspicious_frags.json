  "explanation": "Only uses of the function parameter token need investigation for potential modification. There are no assignments to token itself (no lines like token = ... or pointer arithmetic on token), and the rest of the code operates on the local variable or its members (pthread_cancel(local->handler_thread); status = timer_delete(...); local->assigned_signal = 0; return OS_SUCCESS;). These do not modify the function parameter. The only place the parameter appears is in the function header and where *token is passed to the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro \u2014 these should be inspected to ensure the macro or surrounding code does not attempt to modify the pointer parameter. All other fragments do not touch or modify the function parameter and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 17.8."
