  "explanation": "No pointer declarations in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer-related declarations/usages are:\n\n- The function parameter: const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 already points to a const-qualified type, so it conforms to the rule.\n- The local pointer: OS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t *local; this pointer is used to modify a member (local->assigned_signal = 0), so it must not point to a const-qualified type; making it const would prevent the required mutation and thus would be incorrect.\n- The call strerror(errno) returns a char * but is used only as an argument to a formatting function and is not stored in a pointer declaration; Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and their target types, so this usage does not constitute a violation. The other APIs used (pthread_cancel, timer_delete) take non-pointer types or do not introduce pointer declarations here.\n\nBecause there are no pointer declarations that could reasonably and safely be changed to point to const-qualified types, there are no suspicious fragments to report."
