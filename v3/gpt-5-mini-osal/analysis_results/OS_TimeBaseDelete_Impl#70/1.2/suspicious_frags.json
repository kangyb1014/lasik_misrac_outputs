  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses standard C types (sig_atomic_t, typedef for int32), standard C library errno/strerror, POSIX APIs (pthread_cancel, timer_delete, sigset_t, pthread_t) and a variadic macro (OS_DEBUG) which is a standard C feature since C99 \u2014 none of these are compiler-specific language extensions as described by MISRA C:2012/2023 Rule 1.2. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its use are ordinary macro manipulations, not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for use of language/compiler extensions."
