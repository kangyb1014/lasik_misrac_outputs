  "explanation": "I inspected the provided functions and related macros for any modification of function parameter variables themselves. In OS_SelectFdClear the pointer parameter 'Set' is used to modify the object it points to (Set->object_ids[...] &= ...), which is allowed by Rule 17.8; there is no assignment to the parameter variable 'Set' itself. The objid parameter is passed by value and not modified. In OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex the pointer parameter 'ArrayIndex' is used to store a result via '*ArrayIndex = ...' (modifying the pointed-to object, allowed) and there is no assignment to the pointer variable 'ArrayIndex' itself. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro expands to a BUGCHECK expression that only tests for NULL and does not assign to the pointer. OS_printf's 'String' parameter is not reassigned. Therefore there are no code fragments that modify function parameter variables (only objects they point to), so no fragments need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
