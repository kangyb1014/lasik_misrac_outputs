  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In the provided function the only such call is the memset shown above, so that call must be investigated for possible out-of-bounds accesses. No other calls to <string.h> functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strcat, strlen, etc.) appear in OS_GetFsInfo or in the related symbols provided. The remaining code consists of pointer null-check macros, integer assignments, constants, and iterator usage, none of which invoke string.h routines and therefore do not fall under Rule 21.17."
