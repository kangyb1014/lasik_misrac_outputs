  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the buffer parameter is already declared as const and is assigned to a const-qualified pointer (const struct lfs_diskoff *disk = buffer). The local child array (lfs_block_t child[2]) is a non-pointer object that is intentionally modified by lfs_pair_fromle32, so const-qualification is not appropriate. The call to lfs_bd_read passes the lfs pointer and addresses of mutable cache members (&lfs->pcache, &lfs->rcache); those are expected to be mutable because the block-device read routine likely updates caches, so const would be inappropriate. The lfs structure contains several non-const members (e.g., caches, lookahead buffer) that are used/updated elsewhere, so other pointer uses in this context are intentionally non-const and need not be flagged."
