  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds uses of <string.h> functions:\n\n- lfs_bd_read: The target calls this to read data into the local buffer child. We must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls any string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/etc.) and whether the size/offset arguments passed to those functions can exceed the destination buffer bounds.\n\n- lfs_min, lfs_aligndown, lfs_alignup: These helpers are called by lfs_bd_read (per the call graph) to compute lengths and aligned ranges. Their behavior affects computed sizes passed to any copy functions; they are necessary to reason about whether lfs_bd_read might request more bytes than the child buffer can hold.\n\n- lfs_t: Definition of the filesystem context is needed to inspect members used by lfs_bd_read (pcache, rcache, cfg) and to reason about their types and lifetimes.\n\n- lfs_cache_t (pcache/rcache): Types and sizes of the page/cache structures used by lfs_bd_read can affect internal buffering and copy targets/sources; include to determine any intermediate copies that might overflow.\n\n- struct lfs_config (cfg): Contains block_size and the block-device callback pointers. block_size is passed into lfs_bd_read and influences how many bytes are read/handled; the callbacks may perform memory copies.\n\n- struct lfs_config::read (block-device read callback): lfs_bd_read typically delegates actual reads to the block-device read callback (cfg->read). That callback\u2019s prototype and implementation must be inspected to see if it copies into the provided buffer with correct sizes (it is a common place memcpy/memmove may appear).\n\n- struct lfs_diskoff: Definition (members block and off) is needed to understand the values passed to lfs_bd_read and how offsets are computed, which impacts lengths and copy offsets.\n\n- lfs_block_t: The element type of the child array. sizeof(child) (and element size) determines the number of bytes passed to lfs_bd_read; we must know its size and alignment to check buffer bounds when copies occur.\n\n- lfs_pair_fromle32 and lfs_fromle32: Called after the read to convert endianness in-place. We must inspect their implementations to ensure they do not use string.h functions incorrectly or write/iterate past the child array bounds.\n\n- lfs_pair_cmp: The comparator is not likely to call string.h functions, but include its prototype/implementation to confirm it does not perform any out\u2011of\u2011bounds memory accesses on the same buffer data.\n\n- memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp: These standard functions are the subject of the MISRA rule. Include occurrences/usages of these functions in lfs_bd_read, the block-device read callback, lfs_pair_fromle32, lfs_fromle32, and any other callee so you can check the pointer and size arguments for potential overruns.\n\n- LFS_CMP_EQ, LFS_CMP_LT: Return constants used by the function; not directly relevant to string.h violations but include for completeness when analyzing the function\u2019s control flow and return behavior.\n\nIn short: inspect lfs_bd_read (and the block-device read it calls) and the pair conversion routines because they are the places where memory is written/read and where memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp might be used. Also include types and helpers that determine the sizes/offsets used in those copies so you can prove whether any standard string.h calls could access beyond the bounds of child (or other objects)."
