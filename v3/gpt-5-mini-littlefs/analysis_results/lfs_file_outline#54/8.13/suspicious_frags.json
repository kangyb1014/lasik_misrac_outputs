  "explanation": "I selected all explicit pointer declarators in the provided code that are not const-qualified: the function parameters (lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) in lfs_file_outline, the linked-list pointer members (struct lfs_mlist *next; and the lfs_t member declaration } *mlist;), the lookahead buffer (uint8_t *buffer;), and the file list pointer (struct lfs_file *next;). These are the explicit non-const pointer occurrences visible in the supplied snippets and therefore merit investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13.\n\nI did not include: (a) pointer members that are already const-qualified (for example the cfg pointers are declared const in the snippets), (b) non-pointer scalar fields and typedefs (e.g., lfs_cache_t rcache) because no explicit pointer declarator appears in the shown code for them, and (c) other code outside the supplied snippets because it was not provided. If any typedefs (like lfs_cache_t) are actually pointer types in other parts of the codebase, or if functions called here modify objects pointed to by parameters, those places should be reviewed as well \u2014 but they are not directly visible in the supplied excerpts."
