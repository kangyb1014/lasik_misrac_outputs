  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is needed to judge use of language (compiler) extensions:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: macro/inline wrapper that controls locking. Macros often hide extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, nested macros). Inspect its definition to ensure it does not use compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking macro may expand to extension constructs; its definition must be checked.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: logging/trace macro likely variadic and may expand to complex code. Verify it does not use compiler extensions (statement-expr, typeof, __attribute__, asm, non-standard variadic constructs, token-pasting tricks that are compiler-specific).\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may be implemented using extensions (e.g., expression statements, __builtin_expect, attributes, do-while(0) is fine but other patterns may not). Check its definition for extensions.\n\n- PRId32: format macro from inttypes.h. Although standard in C99/C11, some implementations define it via compiler-specific format specifiers. Inspect its expansion if present in project headers to ensure no non-standard extension is used.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_: called helper \u2014 its implementation may itself use language extensions (attributes, inline asm, GCC extensions, nested functions, statement-expressions). To be sure the call in the target function does not rely on an extension, inspect this symbol's definition.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: used in the assertion cast. Its prototype/definition could use non-standard qualifiers, attributes, or parameter types that rely on extensions. Also inspect whether the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) is required by non-standard type punning.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: the return type \u2014 its typedef may expand to a compiler-specific type or use extension keywords (e.g., long long in non-standard ways, or an anonymous struct/union). Check its typedef to ensure no extension is hidden there.\n\n- lfs_t: the file-system context type \u2014 needed because lfs_file_tell accesses lfs->cfg; the struct definition may use compiler extensions (bit-fields with non-standard widths, anonymous structs/unions as extensions in older standards, attributes on fields). Inspect it.\n\n- lfs_file_t: the file handle type \u2014 inspect its definition for any uses of compiler-specific constructs (anonymous unions/structs, extensions in layout, attributes).\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: the type used in the cast inside the assertion. Its definition should be checked for anonymous-struct/union extensions, attributes, or other non-standard constructs.\n\nIn short: inspect the macros and the callees/types listed above because language extensions are most commonly hidden inside macro definitions, typedefs, attribute annotations, or the implementations of called functions."
