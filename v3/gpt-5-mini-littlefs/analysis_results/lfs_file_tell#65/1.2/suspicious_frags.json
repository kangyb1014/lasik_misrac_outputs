  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Items examined and reasons they are not MISRA Rule 1.2 issues: \n\n- LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros: use standard comma operator and cast-to-void \u2014 ordinary C, not a compiler extension. \n- LFS_TRACE variadic macro: variadic macros are part of standard C (since C99), not an extension. The macro is simply defined empty. \n- LFS_ASSERT(assert(...)): assert is a standard library macro. \n- Use of (void*) casts in LFS_TRACE calls and (void)lfs in lfs_file_tell_(): standard casts and explicit void casts to suppress unused warnings \u2014 not extensions. \n- PRId32 in the format string: macro from <inttypes.h> (standard C) \u2014 not an extension. \n- for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; ...): declaring a loop-local variable in the for-init and pointer operations are standard C (C99 and later). \n- stdint types (int32_t, uint16_t, etc.), bool, and size types: standard headers/types, not compiler extensions. \n- Struct and typedef declarations (including nested struct tag usage): standard C constructs. \n\nNo compiler-specific keywords, attributes (e.g., __attribute__), asm statements, typeof, statement-expressions, zero-length arrays, flexible array members beyond standard, platform intrinsics, or other documented compiler extensions were present in the supplied fragments. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
