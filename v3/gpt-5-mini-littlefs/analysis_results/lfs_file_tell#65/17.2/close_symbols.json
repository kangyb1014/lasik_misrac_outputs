  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_tell() violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer must inspect every symbol it invokes (including macro expansions) to see if any call chain returns to lfs_file_tell. Each listed symbol is required for that reason:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly by lfs_file_tell. You must examine its implementation (and anything it calls) to verify it does not call lfs_file_tell (directly or via other functions).\n- lfs_file_tell_: Called directly and returns the reported offset. You must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call lfs_file_tell (directly or indirectly), which would create recursion.\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro/function used at the start of lfs_file_tell. Its expansion or underlying function may call other functions; those must be checked to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call lfs_file_tell.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Macro/function used before return. Inspect its expansion/implementation for any calls that could lead back to lfs_file_tell.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging/debug macro used twice. Its expansion may call runtime/logging functions that could (in unusual builds) call into filesystem APIs; verify it does not lead to lfs_file_tell.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro wrapping the lfs_mlist_isopen call. Its expansion may call handlers (assert/reporting) that could call other code; check it does not cause an indirect call to lfs_file_tell.\n\nNote: PRId32 is a format macro and does not affect calling behavior, so it is not included. The above symbols (and their transitive callees) are the minimal set needed to prove there is no path from lfs_file_tell back to itself."
