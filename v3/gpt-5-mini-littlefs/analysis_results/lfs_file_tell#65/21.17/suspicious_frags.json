  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function lfs_file_tell and all related definitions supplied (lfs_file_tell_, lfs_mlist_isopen, and the LFS_* macros). There are no calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The LFS_TRACE macro expands to nothing, so it does not introduce any hidden string.h calls. LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are simple macros that do not call string functions. lfs_mlist_isopen performs pointer traversal of a linked list (no buffer copy/compare operations), and lfs_file_tell_ merely returns file->pos (no string operations). The only other macro used is LFS_ASSERT which maps to assert \u2014 assert is not one of the <string.h> functions and there are no explicit string.h calls in the supplied code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation under Rule 21.17."
