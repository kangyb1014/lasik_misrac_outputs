  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: &head is passed as the destination buffer to lfs_bd_read and the function is expected to write into that location, so the pointer must be to a non-const object. MISRA R8.13 requires const qualification only when the pointed-to data is not modified; here that is not the case. (A violating scenario would be if a pointer to data that is not modified were declared/used without const, e.g. passing a non-const pointer to a function that does not alter the pointee.)"
