  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters themselves. Assignments to objects pointed to by pointer parameters (for example writing to *block or *off) are permitted by the rule. The call that takes the address of a compound literal modifies that temporary object, not a function parameter, so it is not a Rule 17.8 concern. Local variables (e.g., current, target) are not function parameters and may be modified. Reads from or writes into cache buffers and uses of pointer parameters where only the pointed-to objects are changed are allowed under the rule and therefore were not flagged."
