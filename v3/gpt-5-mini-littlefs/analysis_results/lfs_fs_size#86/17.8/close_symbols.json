  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check the MISRA rule \u201ca function parameter shall not be modified\u201d: \n\n- lfs_fs_size_: This is the direct callee. We must inspect its prototype and body to ensure it does not take the address of the caller's parameter (e.g. via a pointer-to-pointer) or otherwise cause the caller's parameter variable to be modified (for example by receiving &lfs through another call or by writing to a global that aliases the parameter).\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this function. The callee chain must be checked because a deeper callee could be passed the address of the original parameter (directly or indirectly) or perform operations that effectively modify the caller's parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro): The macro is invoked with lfs->cfg. Macros can expand into code that has side effects on surrounding variables (they can reference or assign to the parameter identifier, or take its address). We need the macro expansion/definition to ensure it does not modify the local parameter variable 'lfs' (e.g. via &lfs or by assigning to lfs).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 must check its expansion for any modifications to the parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): Trace macros often evaluate their arguments or call helper functions; the expansion could (hypothetically) take addresses, call functions that modify variables, or redefine identifiers in a way that affects 'lfs'. Verify it does not modify the parameter.\n\n- definition of lfs_t (struct/typedef): The parameter is lfs_t *lfs. We must know the structure so we can reason about the lvalue expression lfs->cfg (e.g. whether cfg is a macro, bit-field, or a getter that could have side effects), and to check whether taking or passing its fields could indirectly lead to modification of the parameter variable.\n\n- definition/type of lfs->cfg (configuration type): LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK receive lfs->cfg; the type and any operators on it matter \u2014 for example if cfg is itself a macro or an expression with side effects, or if locking helpers accept pointers to the caller's pointer (unlikely but possible). We must inspect this type/definition to be sure no code path writes to the caller parameter.\n\n- any functions/macros expanded/used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE: If those macros expand to calls to internal lock/unlock/trace functions, we need the definitions of those functions to confirm they do not take &lfs or otherwise modify the caller's parameter variable.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the pointer parameter 'lfs' (the parameter variable) is being modified, you must inspect the called functions and macro expansions and the involved types to detect any usages that take its address or assign to it. The symbols above are the minimal items required to perform that check."
