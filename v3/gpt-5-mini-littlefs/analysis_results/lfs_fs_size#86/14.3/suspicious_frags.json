  "explanation": "No loop constructs (for/while/do-while) appear in the provided code, and other conditional controlling expressions are driven by non-constant values. The check in lfs_fs_size_ that tests the result of lfs_fs_traverse_ uses a function return value and is not invariant. The LFS_TRACE and LFS_UNLOCK macros are no-ops or simple casts as defined here and do not introduce controlling expressions. Therefore, aside from the reported fragment, there are no other obvious invariant controlling expressions in the supplied code that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
