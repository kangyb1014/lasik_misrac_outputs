Thus the controlling expression is an invariant false (if (0)), not an allowed infinite-loop or do-while exception.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown translation unit LFS_LOCK(cfg) is defined as ((void)cfg,0), so the initialization int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); always yields the constant 0. The controlling expression if (err) therefore reduces to if (0), an invariant false expression. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions except for the two listed exceptions (infinite loops and the special do-while constant-false case), neither of which applies here. Hence this use of if (err) violates Rule 14.3 in the provided configuration. (If LFS_LOCK were conditionally defined to return a non-constant status in other builds, this could avoid the violation; but given the provided definition the report is correct.)"
