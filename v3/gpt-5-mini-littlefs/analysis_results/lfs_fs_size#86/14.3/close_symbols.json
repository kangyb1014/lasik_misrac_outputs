  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The controlling expression in the function is `if (err)` where err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To determine whether that controlling expression can be invariant (always true or always false) we must inspect the exact definition/expansion and semantics of LFS_LOCK (macro or function), including whether it always returns a constant value.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although not directly used in a controlling expression here, LFS_UNLOCK is a paired macro/call with LFS_LOCK and its expansion could contain control statements (macros expand into code evaluated in this function). Its definition must be inspected for any invariant controlling expressions introduced by macro expansion.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is invoked twice inside the function. Macros expand into code which may contain controlling expressions (for example, `if (TRACE_ENABLED) ...`). To decide whether the target function violates the MISRA rule, the expansions of LFS_TRACE (and any boolean/configuration symbols it uses) must be checked for invariant controlling expressions.\n- lfs_fs_size_: The call target itself is not a controlling expression in this function, but it is called within the function body; if its declaration or inline definition is a macro/inline function that expands into control structures, or if it affects global state that would make other controlling expressions invariant, it must be inspected.\n- type/definition of lfs_t (particularly the cfg member): LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg; to understand what LFS_LOCK does we need the type and layout of cfg (what fields it contains), because LFS_LOCK may use cfg fields (e.g. function pointers or flags) that determine the value it returns.\n- definition(s) of the lock/unlock callbacks stored in cfg (e.g. cfg->lock, cfg->unlock): If LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK expand to calls through cfg->lock/cfg->unlock, those callbacks' implementations determine whether the result is invariant.\n- error-code macros/definitions that LFS_LOCK may return (e.g. LFS_ERR_*, 0): To evaluate whether `if (err)` is effectively an invariant boolean expression, we need the set of possible return values (and their definitions) from LFS_LOCK so we can tell if err can take more than one value.\n\nProviding these symbols (their definitions/headers) will let the next analyzer expand macros and reason whether any controlling expression that appears (including from macro expansion) is invariant per the MISRA C rule."
