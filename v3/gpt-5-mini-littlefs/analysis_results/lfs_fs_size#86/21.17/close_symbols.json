  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_size violates the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions you must inspect any functions and types it uses (and their callees) that could call string.h routines or pass buffers/pointers to them:\n\n- lfs_fs_size_: This is the direct callee that does the real work. Its implementation (and anything it calls) may contain calls to memcpy, memset, strlen, strcpy, etc., so you must inspect it for out-of-bounds uses.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: Static call graph shows lfs_fs_size_ calls lfs_fs_traverse_. That function (and its callees) could perform string/memory operations; include it for recursive analysis.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: The logging macro/function may perform formatting or buffer operations (snprintf, memcpy of message buffers, strlen, etc.). Inspect its definition to ensure it doesn't use string.h functions in a way that could access buffers beyond their bounds.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions operate on lfs->cfg. Although usually synchronization-related, their implementations might call helper routines that use memory/string functions; include them to be safe.\n\n- lfs_t: The structure definition is required to know the layout and types of members (notably cfg) and to reason about lifetimes and sizes of buffers/pointers passed down to callees.\n\n- lfs_cfg: The configuration/type of lfs->cfg may contain buffer sizes, pointers, or callbacks that affect how string/memory functions are used. You need its definition to judge buffer bounds and correct usage.\n\n- lfs_ssize_t: The exact signed width/representation of the return type is required to interpret returned error codes vs. sizes and to check any conversions that might affect bounds checks or cause signed/unsigned mistakes related to string/memory APIs.\n\nNote: If, when inspecting the above symbols, you find additional functions they call that use <string.h> functions, include those symbols as well and repeat the same reasoning recursively."
