  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in lfs_fs_size is unreachable you must know all definitions that can affect control flow or the function's reachable paths: \n\n- LFS_LOCK: May be a macro or function that can cause non-local control flow (e.g. return, longjmp, abort) or expand to conditional/loop constructs; its definition is required to see whether code after the call can ever be executed.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although used after the second LFS_TRACE, its definition is needed if it can alter control flow (non-returning, longjmp, abort) which would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Often a macro; it could expand to code that affects control flow (early return, abort, longjmp) or side-effects that remove code paths. Its expansion must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_fs_size_: The callee may itself not return (infinite loop, abort, longjmp) or may contain constructs that make the post-call code unreachable. You must examine its implementation.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this function; if lfs_fs_traverse_ (or functions it calls) is non-returning or otherwise affects control flow, that propagates to lfs_fs_size and can create unreachable code in the caller.\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition): Needed to resolve the type and layout of lfs and the cfg field so you can determine how LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE apply to lfs->cfg and whether those expand to different code based on cfg contents.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration/lock fields): If LFS_LOCK is implemented via function pointers or cfg-dependent macros, you need the cfg type to resolve which function/macro is actually invoked and whether it can produce non-local exits.\n\n- lfs_ssize_t (typedef): Needed to understand the return type and whether special sentinel values or macros used in returns could affect reachability reasoning.\n\nThese symbols allow a subsequent analyser to expand macros and follow callee implementations to determine if any statements in lfs_fs_size are syntactically or semantically impossible to reach (MISRA: no unreachable code)."
