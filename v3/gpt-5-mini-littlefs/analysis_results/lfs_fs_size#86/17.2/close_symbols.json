  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_size violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect recursion we must inspect all functions it calls and any functions those call, and also any called macros that may expand to function calls. 1) lfs_fs_size_: this is the immediate callee; we need its body to see if it calls lfs_fs_size (direct) or other functions that can lead back to lfs_fs_size (indirect). 2) lfs_fs_traverse_: static graph shows lfs_fs_size_ calls lfs_fs_traverse_; we must inspect lfs_fs_traverse_ and its callees to see if any path returns to lfs_fs_size or lfs_fs_size_. 3) LFS_LOCK and 4) LFS_UNLOCK: these appear as macros/calls in the target; if they are functions (or expand to calls) they could participate in a recursion cycle \u2014 their definitions are needed to rule that out. 5) LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function could also expand to calls; include its definition to ensure it does not call back into the filesystem API. Note: after examining lfs_fs_traverse_ you may need to add any of its callees recursively until no new functions that could reach lfs_fs_size / lfs_fs_size_ remain."
