  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_size violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must examine the actual code that executes under lfs_fs_size: 1) lfs_fs_size_ \u2014 direct callee of the target; its implementation may call memcmp or otherwise compare strings. 2) lfs_fs_traverse_ \u2014 called by lfs_fs_size_; memcmp usage may occur deeper in the traversal. Also include the definitions of any transitive callees that lfs_fs_traverse_ invokes (listed explicitly if available) so their bodies can be inspected. 3) memcmp \u2014 the standard function itself (declaration/usage sites) so occurrences are recognized and argument types/lengths can be inspected. 4) strcmp and strncmp \u2014 the intended safe alternatives; their presence/absence and use may indicate whether comparisons are using proper null-terminated string APIs or unsafe memcmp. 5) lfs_t and related type definitions (lfs_cfg_t, lfs_dir_t, lfs_file_t, lfs_cache_t) \u2014 to determine the types of buffers/fields passed to memcmp (whether they are char pointers or fixed-length buffers, whether they are documented/implemented as null-terminated strings). Without the callee function bodies and the relevant type/structure definitions you cannot reliably decide if a memcmp call is being used to compare null-terminated strings. Include any additional structures or helper functions referenced by the bodies of lfs_fs_size_, lfs_fs_traverse_ and their transitive callees so the argument provenance for memcmp calls can be established."
