  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_size_: Need the function prototype and body to see whether it modifies the object pointed to by the parameter (or passes the pointer to non-const APIs). If it writes through the pointer or calls functions that require non-const, the outer wrapper cannot make its parameter const.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this function (per call graph). Its prototype/body are needed to determine whether traversal mutates the lfs state or accepts/propagates non-const pointers (which would prevent making the original parameter const).\n- lfs_t (struct definition): Required to know the exact type of the parameter, its members (especially whether any members are mutable or declared non-const), and whether making the function parameter a pointer-to-const is type-correct.\n- lfs->cfg type (cfg / lfs_config definition): The code passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; the cfg type and its const-qualification determine whether those calls would require dropping const (preventing const qualification of lfs or its members).\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): The expansion/signature shows whether it requires a modifiable cfg pointer (or performs casts that discard const). If it needs a non-const pointer, the wrapper cannot make lfs const without violating types or needing casts.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK: its signature/behavior may force non-const.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): The trace call explicitly casts (void*)lfs; if LFS_TRACE or its usage discards const qualifiers (or requires non-const void*), that would be a const-discarding operation and relevant to the MISRA rule. Need the macro to see whether making lfs const introduces a cast/discard.\n- lfs_lock / lfs_unlock prototypes (if different from macros): If LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expand to calls into these functions, their prototypes are required to see whether they accept const pointers or modify the cfg object.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows checking (1) whether the target function or any callees mutate the pointed-to object, (2) whether any called macros/functions require non-const pointers or perform casts that drop const, and thus whether the parameter could/should be declared as pointer-to-const under MISRA guidance."
