  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are compile-time invariant. The function contains only if statements whose conditions depend on runtime values (id and tag) returned from parameters or function calls, so they are not invariant. There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) with constant conditions; therefore neither the general prohibition nor the listed exceptions to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 are triggered. The helper inline lfs_tag_type3 operates on the runtime value tag and is therefore not an invariant expression. Consequently, there are no code fragments that require investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
