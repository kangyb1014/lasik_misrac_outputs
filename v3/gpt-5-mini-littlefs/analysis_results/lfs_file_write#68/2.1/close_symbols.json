  "explanation": "To determine whether any statement in lfs_file_write is statically unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code), we must inspect all symbols that can alter control flow inside the function: \n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is called at the top and its expansion/implementation can contain control-flow altering constructs (return, exit, longjmp, infinite loop, conditional returns, etc.). If LFS_LOCK always returns a non-zero value or itself performs a control-flow transfer, the rest of the function would be unreachable. You must see the macro/function body. \n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although used only at the end, its definition could include control-flow changes (return/longjmp) that make subsequent code or the final return unreachable in some builds. Inspecting it is necessary to ensure the end-of-function sequence is reachable as written. \n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertions often expand differently between builds (no-op in release, abort/return in debug). LFS_ASSERT could abort or return when its condition fails, making the call to lfs_file_write_ or later statements unreachable. Its exact expansion is required to establish reachability. \n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros occasionally include control-flow constructs (early returns, conditional compilation) in some configurations. Verify its definition to ensure it does not render subsequent lines unreachable. \n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: The assert checks this call. If this function is a macro or is implemented such that it always evaluates in a way that triggers LFS_ASSERT's abort/return, code after the assert might be unreachable. The function body/definition is needed to reason about whether the assert can be true/false or is statically constant. \n\n- lfs_file_write_: This is the main callee executed after the assert. If lfs_file_write_ is a macro or inlined function with control-flow that could affect reachability (e.g. it expands to code earlier or contains infinite loops/returns that change fallthrough), its definition is required to determine which statements in lfs_file_write are genuinely reachable. \n\n- definitions used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (e.g., cfg->lock and cfg->unlock functions): Commonly the lock macros delegate to function pointers in lfs->cfg. Those target functions can contain control-flow transfers (return values, exit/abort). Their implementations are needed to decide whether the branch that follows the lock is ever taken or whether code becomes unreachable.\n\nIn short, any macro or function called inside lfs_file_write that could alter control flow must be inspected. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether any statements in lfs_file_write are statically unreachable under the various build/configuration expansions."
