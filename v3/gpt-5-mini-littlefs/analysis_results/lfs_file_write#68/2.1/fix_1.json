  "explanation": "The nested function probe_log inside lfs_file_write was invalid in ISO C. I moved probe_log to file scope as a static helper function (above lfs_file_write) and kept its implementation unchanged. I also added #include <stdio.h> and #include <inttypes.h> so FILE and the PRIu32/PRId32 macros are available. The original control flow and logging behavior of lfs_file_write are preserved."
