  "explanation": "Only code fragments that declare or manipulate pointer types, or that cast/forward pointer values, are relevant to Rule 8.13. The function contains no other pointer declarations or pointer casts beyond those listed. Other lines (e.g. LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); the integer local declarations err and res; the trace of the return value; LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); and the return statement) do not introduce pointer-to-non-const usage that could be made const-qualified, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
