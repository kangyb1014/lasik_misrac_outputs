  "explanation": "To check the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible we must examine the types and prototypes that determine whether pointers are being (unnecessarily) passed or cast away as non-const:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (prototype): determines the parameter types (e.g. whether it takes a const struct lfs_mlist *). The call in the target casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*) \u2014 we need the prototype to see if const is being dropped or if the parameter should be const.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition / typedef): to know the exact type passed to lfs_mlist_isopen and whether it semantically should be const; also to verify if casting from lfs_file_t* to struct lfs_mlist* discards const qualifiers.\n\n- lfs_file_write_ (prototype): target forwards file and buffer to this function. We must see if its parameters accept const-qualified pointers (especially buffer and/or file). If lfs_file_write_ takes non-const pointers but does not modify, that would violate the rule.\n\n- lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite (prototypes): these are callees of lfs_file_write_ and may show whether buffer or file arguments are ultimately used/modified. Their parameter const-qualification affects whether upstream pointers should be const.\n\n- lfs_file_t (definition / typedef): to determine whether the file object itself is intended to be mutable. If the file object is not modified by lfs_mlist_isopen or other checks, it might be a candidate for a const-qualified pointer; we need the type to decide.\n\n- lfs_t (definition / typedef): required to inspect the type of lfs->cfg (its member type) and any pointer fields passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK to see if those functions accept const pointers or if const is being dropped.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro / function declarations): these are called with lfs->cfg; their parameter types determine whether cfg should be a pointer-to-const. If these macros/functions accept non-const pointers but do not modify the pointed object, const qualification may be appropriate.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the analyzer determine where pointer-to-const qualifiers could be added or are being inappropriately removed (casts), and whether any non-const parameter usage is justified by actual mutating behavior in the called functions."
