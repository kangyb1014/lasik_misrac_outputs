  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_write uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the macros, typedefs and any called functions it depends on. Specifically:\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these macros are invoked directly and may expand to compiler-specific constructs (inline asm, attributes, builtins, or non-standard locking primitives). Their definitions are needed to detect extensions.\n- LFS_TRACE: expands to the tracing/logging implementation and may use variadic macros, compiler-specific format attributes, __builtin_* functions, or other extensions; inspect its definition.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may use compiler extensions (e.g., __builtin_trap, __attribute__, __extension__ tokens); its definition is required.\n- lfs_ssize_t / lfs_size_t: the signed/unsigned size types may be typedefs to non-standard integer types (compiler-specific widths, long long, __int128, or use of attributes); check their definitions.\n- lfs_t / lfs_file_t: the opaque types for the filesystem and file may contain compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bitfields with implementation-defined widths, flexible array members in non-standard ways); need their definitions.\n- type of lfs->cfg: the cfg field is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; its type or members may be involved in macro expansions that use extensions (attributes or compiler-specific APIs), so include its definition.\n- PRIu32 / PRId32: format macros come from <inttypes.h> \u2014 verify they are the standard macros and not redefined using compiler extensions.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): although a callee, its prototype/definition should be checked for use of compiler extensions (inline, attributes, non-standard linkage) because the assert macro calls it and that could introduce extensions.\n- lfs_file_write_ (declaration/definition): the internal write routine is called and its declaration/definition may use language extensions (e.g., inline, attributes, non-standard calling conventions) that affect the compiled code.  \n\nProviding these symbols (macro and type definitions and the cited function declarations/definitions) allows the next analyzer to expand the macros and inspect any compiler-specific tokens or attributes to decide if any language extensions are used."
