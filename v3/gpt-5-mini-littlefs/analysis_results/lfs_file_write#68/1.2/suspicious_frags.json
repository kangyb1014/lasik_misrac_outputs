  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C (C99 or later) features or standard library macros: \n\n- PRIu32 / PRId32 are standard format specifier macros from <inttypes.h>, not compiler extensions.\n- int32_t, uint32_t and related typedefs are standard fixed-width integer types from <stdint.h>.\n- Variadic macro usage (__VA_ARGS__) in LFS_TRACE is part of standard C (since C99).\n- The comma operator used in the LFS_LOCK macro, the (void) cast in LFS_UNLOCK, and empty macro expansion are standard C idioms.\n- Pointer casts (e.g. (void*) and (struct lfs_mlist*)file) and nested struct declarations are standard C.\n- Use of assert via LFS_ASSERT is standard C library usage.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler extensions (for example __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, inline asm, _Pragma with compiler-specific tokens, or other vendor-specific keywords) were found. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for Rule 1.2."
