  "explanation": "The only potential invariant controlling expression is the if (err) test: given the provided macro definition LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0), err is always 0 and the conditional is invariant. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the for loop in lfs_mlist_isopen (for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next)) has a non-constant controlling expression that depends on the list contents and is not invariant; LFS_ASSERT calls assert with a runtime-evaluated expression (not statically invariant); LFS_TRACE is an empty macro (no controlling expression); LFS_UNLOCK is a void macro used as a statement; the call and return of lfs_file_write_ involve no controlling expressions. Therefore only the LFS_LOCK usage / if (err) check (together with the LFS_LOCK macro definition) must be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.3."
