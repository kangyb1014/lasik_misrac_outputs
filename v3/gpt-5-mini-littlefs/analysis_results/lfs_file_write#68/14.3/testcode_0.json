  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is: Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\nHere are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 14.3.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe macro LFS_LOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg, 0), so int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) always yields 0. Consequently the controlling expression if (err) in lfs_file_write is invariant (always false), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The provided exceptions (infinite loops or do-while false constant) do not apply to this if-statement.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_write code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/685.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_write as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_write:\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_file_write(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_write(%p, %p, %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, buffer, size);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_file_write_(lfs, file, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_write -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_file_write code.\n",
