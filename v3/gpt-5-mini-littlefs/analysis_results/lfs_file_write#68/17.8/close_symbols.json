  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_write violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be sure none of the function's parameters (lfs, file, buffer, size) are assigned/modified inside the function body \u2014 including via macros or expanded inline code. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros or inline helpers invoked with lfs->cfg. A macro expansion could contain assignments or side-effects that reference or assign to the parameter variable names (for example, if implemented in a way that refers to 'lfs' or rebinds identifiers). Inspecting their definitions is necessary to prove they do not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is passed (void*)lfs, (void*)file, buffer, size. A macro expansion could contain code that manipulates or assigns to the argument identifiers (rare but possible in complex debug macros). We need its definition to ensure it does not modify parameter variables.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: The assertion macro is given the result of lfs_mlist_isopen. An assertion macro might evaluate expressions or expand into code that could modify identifiers; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not change any parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: This callee could be a macro or inline function that, if expanded in-place, might modify the passed-in expressions (the casted file argument). We need its prototype/definition to confirm it does not assign to the local parameter 'file' (or otherwise modify the parameter variables via side effects in the expansion).\n\n- lfs_file_write_: This is the primary internal writer called from lfs_file_write. If lfs_file_write_ is a macro or an inline that expands in the caller, it might contain code that assigns to the parameters (rebinds/overwrites the local parameter variables). The definition is required to ensure the call is a pure call (no parameter reassignment in the caller scope) and to check that no macro-style expansion modifies the local parameter identifiers.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist, lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: The parameter and related type definitions are needed to determine whether any parameter is declared with const-qualification (e.g., pointer-to-const vs const-pointer) or otherwise defined in a way that affects whether an assignment would violate the MISRA rule. For example, if a typedef hides const or if lfs_file_t is a macro that expands to something unusual, that could change the analysis. Also the structure of lfs (to see lfs->cfg) and struct lfs_mlist are needed to determine whether any operations in macros/callees could cause a write to the parameter variables themselves.\n\nChecking these symbols (macro definitions and the two callee implementations/types) is sufficient to prove whether any parameter identifier is modified in lfs_file_write, either directly in the function body or indirectly via expanded macros/inline definitions."
