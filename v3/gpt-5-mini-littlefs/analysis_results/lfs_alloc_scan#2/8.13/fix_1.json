  "explanation": "The original source was truncated inside a fprintf string which caused a parse/compile failure. I completed the lfs_log_state function by finishing the interrupted fprintf, added prints for the remaining fields, and closed the FILE with fclose. The format specifiers use PRIuPTR as before and pointers are cast to uintptr_t where appropriate. No other logic or functions were added or changed."
