  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code calls memset to zero the buffer, so lfs->lookahead.buffer must be a pointer to a modifiable (non-const) object. Rule 8.13 asks for const qualification when possible, but here const is not possible because the memory is written. A genuine violation would be if lfs->lookahead.buffer were declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const uint8_t *) and then passed to memset (which would attempt to modify it), thus discarding the const qualifier."
