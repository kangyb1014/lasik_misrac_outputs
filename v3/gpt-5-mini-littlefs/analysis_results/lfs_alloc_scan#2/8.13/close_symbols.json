  "explanation": "To determine whether pointers in lfs_alloc_scan should be const-qualified you must see the actual types and declarations that govern how they are used:\n\n- lfs_t (definition): lfs_alloc_scan takes lfs_t *lfs and reads/modifies multiple members. You must know the exact member types and whether any pointer members are declared with const (or could be made const).\n- lfs_t::lookahead (type/definition and its fields): The function assigns to start, next, size and writes to buffer via memset and uses ckpoint. You need the exact types and qualifiers of these fields (especially buffer's type and whether it is declared as a pointer or array and if it is const-qualified) to judge whether any pointer should be const.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg struct/typedef) and its field lookahead_size: The code reads lfs->cfg->lookahead_size. If cfg is a pointer type, you must know whether it is declared const or could be declared const (i.e., whether cfg or its fields are modified elsewhere). The type of lookahead_size also affects whether lfs_min should take a const parameter (if any pointer indirection occurs).\n- lfs_min (declaration/definition): Although lfs_min likely returns a scalar, its signature may involve pointer parameters or macros that affect const-correctness in expressions. Confirming its prototype ensures no hidden pointer conversions or expectations.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_ (prototype): This call passes the lfs pointer and a callback; you must know whether lfs_fs_traverse_ takes lfs_t * or const lfs_t * (and whether it modifies lfs). If it could accept a const pointer, then callers might be able to use const where appropriate.\n- lfs_alloc_lookahead (callback prototype passed to lfs_fs_traverse_): The callback signature determines the constness of the user data pointer and the lfs pointer passed through traverse. If the callback does not modify the pointed-to data, the user pointer or lfs could be const-qualified.\n- lfs_alloc_drop (prototype): lfs_alloc_scan calls this on error. If lfs_alloc_drop does not modify lfs (or only uses parts that should be mutable), that affects whether lfs_alloc_scan's lfs parameter could be const in some contexts. You must see its prototype/implementation to decide.\n- memset (declaration): memset takes a non-const void * destination. The fact that buffer is passed to memset proves buffer cannot be const; including memset clarifies standard-library expectations and prevents false positives about making buffer const.\n\nProviding these definitions/prototypes allows the analyzer to determine which pointer types are actually modified and which could be const-qualified without changing behavior, and therefore whether lfs_alloc_scan (and related APIs) violate the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer targets."
