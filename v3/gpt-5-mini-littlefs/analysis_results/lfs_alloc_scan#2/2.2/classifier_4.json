Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_alloc_scan:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_alloc_scan(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    // move lookahead buffer to the first unused block\n    //\n    // note we limit the lookahead buffer to at most the amount of blocks\n    // checkpointed, this prevents the math in lfs_alloc from underflowing\n    lfs->lookahead.start = (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next) \n            % lfs->block_count;\n    lfs->lookahead.next = 0;\n    lfs->lookahead.size = lfs_min(\n            8*lfs->cfg->lookahead_size,\n            lfs->lookahead.ckpoint);\n\n    // find mask of free blocks from tree\n    memset(lfs->lookahead.buffer, 0, lfs->cfg->lookahead_size);\n    int err = lfs_fs_traverse_(lfs, lfs_alloc_lookahead, lfs, true);\n    if (err) {\n        lfs_alloc_drop(lfs);\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nlfs->lookahead.start = (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next) \n            % lfs->block_count;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not globally violated. The assignment is only dead in specific runtime situations \u2014 e.g. if lfs->lookahead.next == 0 (or lfs->lookahead.next % lfs->block_count == 0) and lfs->lookahead.start is already in the range [0, lfs->block_count-1], the statement has no net effect (start remains unchanged) and removing it for that execution would not change behavior. However, in general lfs->lookahead.next can be non-zero and the assignment changes state used later (e.g. by lfs_alloc_lookahead during traversal), so the code is not globally dead and Rule 2.2 is not violated."
