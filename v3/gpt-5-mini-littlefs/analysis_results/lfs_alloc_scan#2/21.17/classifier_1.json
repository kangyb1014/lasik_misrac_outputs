  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: it does not call any of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so the rule is not triggered here. Note: a related risk is integer overflow in 8 * lfs->cfg->lookahead_size producing a value larger than the actual buffer capacity; if that (unchecked) value is later passed to memcpy/memset/str* calls it could cause an out-of-bounds access and thus violate Rule 21.17. Ensure the multiplication is done in an appropriate type and the result is bounds-checked before any string/memory function use."
