  "scenario": "Potential buffer-overflow: memset(lfs->lookahead.buffer, 0, lfs->cfg->lookahead_size) will write lfs->cfg->lookahead_size bytes into the object pointed to by lfs->lookahead.buffer. The shown fragment contains no local proof that the object underlying lfs->lookahead.buffer is at least lfs->cfg->lookahead_size bytes long (it could be smaller or NULL). If buffer is smaller than cfg->lookahead_size (or uninitialised/NULL), this memset will write beyond the object bounds and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
