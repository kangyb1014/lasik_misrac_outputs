  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the pointer parameter itself (reassigning the parameter variable), but permits modifying the object it points to. In this function the parameter lfs is never reassigned; all assignments target members of *lfs (e.g. lfs->lookahead.start, lfs->lookahead.next, lfs->lookahead.size), which is allowed. The memset operates on lfs->lookahead.buffer (the object pointed to by a member), also allowed. Function calls (lfs_fs_traverse_, lfs_alloc_drop) pass the pointer but do not reassign the parameter within this function. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no fragments need further investigation."
