  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 is: Functions shall not call themselves, either directly or indirectly.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 17.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call int err = cb(data, dir.tail[i]); invokes an arbitrary callback. If that callback calls back into the traversal/allocator, an indirect recursion occurs. For example: lfs_alloc_scan() -> lfs_fs_traverse_(..., lfs_alloc_lookahead, ...) -> cb (lfs_alloc_lookahead) -> lfs_alloc_scan(), forming an indirect recursive cycle (lfs_alloc_scan -> lfs_fs_traverse_ -> lfs_alloc_scan). This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_alloc_scan code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/26.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_alloc_scan as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_alloc_scan:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_alloc_scan(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    // move lookahead buffer to the first unused block\n    //\n    // note we limit the lookahead buffer to at most the amount of blocks\n    // checkpointed, this prevents the math in lfs_alloc from underflowing\n    lfs->lookahead.start = (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next) \n            % lfs->block_count;\n    lfs->lookahead.next = 0;\n    lfs->lookahead.size = lfs_min(\n            8*lfs->cfg->lookahead_size,\n            lfs->lookahead.ckpoint);\n\n    // find mask of free blocks from tree\n    memset(lfs->lookahead.buffer, 0, lfs->cfg->lookahead_size);\n    int err = lfs_fs_traverse_(lfs, lfs_alloc_lookahead, lfs, true);\n    if (err) {\n        lfs_alloc_drop(lfs);\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_alloc_scan code.\n",
