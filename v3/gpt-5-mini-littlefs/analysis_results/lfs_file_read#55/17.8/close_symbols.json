  "explanation": "LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros/functions invoked with expressions involving the parameter 'lfs' (lfs->cfg). If they are macros they could expand to code that assigns to their argument expressions (thereby modifying the local parameter variables). We must inspect their definitions to ensure they do not reassign the function parameters.\n\nLFS_TRACE: a tracing macro that takes the parameters (including buffer and size). As a macro it could expand into code that assigns to its arguments; verify it does not modify any parameter variables.\n\nLFS_ASSERT: assertion macro wrapping the call to lfs_mlist_isopen. Macros can perform assignments to argument expressions; inspect its definition to confirm it does not modify parameters.\n\nlfs_mlist_isopen: called with (lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file). Although a normal function cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables, this symbol might be a macro or inline that could assign to its arguments (e.g. to the 'file' lvalue). Check its implementation to ensure it does not modify the function parameters.\n\nlfs_file_read_: invoked with the function's parameters. Include it because it might be a macro/inline that expands here and could reassign parameter variables; if it is a normal function it cannot change the local parameter variables, but its definition must be checked to rule out macro/inline reassignments.\n\n(Reasoning summary: MISRA rule targets modification of the function's parameter variables within this function. Any macro or inline symbol used in the body can, via textual expansion, reassign those parameters. The listed symbols are all code entities whose definitions must be inspected to determine whether they perform such assignments.)"
