  "explanation": "Other parts of the function use standard C constructs: control flow (if/return), bitwise operations on flags, local variable declarations, function calls, use of fixed-width integer types (uint16_t) and pointer types, and standard C comments. There is no usage of obvious compiler-specific extensions such as inline assembly, __attribute__ annotations, typeof, statement-expressions (GNU ({ ... })), nested functions, or GCC-specific keywords. The only constructs that could rely on a compiler language extension are the brace-enclosed initializer-like expressions passed to LFS_MKATTRS; therefore those macro-argument fragments are reported for investigation. All other code fragments appear to be standard C and do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
