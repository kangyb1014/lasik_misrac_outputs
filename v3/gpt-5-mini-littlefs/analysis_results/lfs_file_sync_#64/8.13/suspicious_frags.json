  "explanation": "I selected pointer-typed usages and pointer arguments in this function that should be reviewed to determine whether the pointee types can/should be const-qualified. Other fragments in the function do not need investigation under Rule 8.13 because:\n- Local non-pointer objects (e.g., the local struct variable ctz and scalar variables like type, size) are not subject to pointer const-qualification.\n- The local pointer variable buffer is already declared as const void * (so it satisfies the rule).\n- Members declared const in the provided type definitions (for example, the cfg pointers inside lfs_t and lfs_file_t) are already const-qualified and need no further inspection for this rule.\n- Operations that write through the file pointer (for example, file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED and file->flags &= ~LFS_F_DIRTY) clearly require a non-const lfs_file_t * and therefore are not candidates for adding const.\n- Calls or macros that likely modify the referenced state (e.g., functions that commit or sync caches) may legitimately require non-const pointers; those specific call sites are included above for investigation, while other non-pointer code paths do not need review for this rule.\n\nThe fragments listed are the pointer usages in the function that should be investigated to confirm whether the pointee types could be const-qualified without breaking semantics."
