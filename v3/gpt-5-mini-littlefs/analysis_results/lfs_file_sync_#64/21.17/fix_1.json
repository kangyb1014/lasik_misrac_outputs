  "explanation": "The project failed because lfs->cfg did not have members attr_count and attrs; accessing them caused compile errors. I removed the unsafe access in the logging function and replaced that log line with a safe message indicating those fields are unavailable. This preserves the original runtime behavior and logic of lfs_file_sync_ while avoiding references to non-existent struct members. All other logic (including the later use of file->cfg->attr_count and file->cfg->attrs) is unchanged."
