  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe code computes diff = lfs_alignup(pcache->size, lfs->cfg->prog_size) and then calls lfs_bd_cmp(..., pcache->buffer, diff). If the actual storage/valid data for pcache->buffer is only pcache->size bytes (or otherwise shorter than diff), lfs_bd_cmp will likely call a string.h routine such as memcmp/memcpy with length diff and thus access beyond pcache->buffer bounds. For example, if prog_size > pcache->size and pcache->buffer was only populated/allocated for pcache->size bytes, diff will be larger than the valid buffer length and result in out-of-bounds accesses inside lfs_bd_cmp.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_sync_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/649.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_sync_ as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_sync_:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_file_sync_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    if (file->flags & LFS_F_ERRED) {\n        // it's not safe to do anything if our file errored\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file);\n    if (err) {\n        file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n        return err;\n    }\n\n\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_DIRTY) &&\n            !lfs_pair_isnull(file->m.pair)) {\n        // before we commit metadata, we need sync the disk to make sure\n        // data writes don't complete after metadata writes\n        if (!(file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE)) {\n            err = lfs_bd_sync(lfs, &lfs->pcache, &lfs->rcache, false);\n            if (err) {\n                return err;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // update dir entry\n        uint16_t type;\n        const void *buffer;\n        lfs_size_t size;\n        struct lfs_ctz ctz;\n        if (file->flags & LFS_F_INLINE) {\n            // inline the whole file\n            type = LFS_TYPE_INLINESTRUCT;\n            buffer = file->cache.buffer;\n            size = file->ctz.size;\n        } else {\n            // update the ctz reference\n            type = LFS_TYPE_CTZSTRUCT;\n            // copy ctz so alloc will work during a relocate\n            ctz = file->ctz;\n            lfs_ctz_tole32(&ctz);\n            buffer = &ctz;\n            size = sizeof(ctz);\n        }\n\n        // commit file data and attributes\n        err = lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &file->m, LFS_MKATTRS(\n                {LFS_MKTAG(type, file->id, size), buffer},\n                {LFS_MKTAG(LFS_FROM_USERATTRS, file->id,\n                    file->cfg->attr_count), file->cfg->attrs}));\n        if (err) {\n            file->flags |= LFS_F_ERRED;\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        file->flags &= ~LFS_F_DIRTY;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_file_sync_ code.\n",
