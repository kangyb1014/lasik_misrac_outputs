  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments (lfs_removeattr, lfs_removeattr_, and lfs_commitattr). None of these contain any call to memcmp or any other explicit memory comparison of null-terminated strings. The only use of a string is passing path to LFS_TRACE with a \"%s\" format specifier, which does not use memcmp. Other functions referenced (e.g., lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_fetch) are not defined in the supplied fragments, so there is no evidence in the provided code that memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
