  "explanation": "I examined the provided code and related macros for use of compiler-specific language extensions. I found no constructs that are explicit compiler extensions (such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, zero-length arrays, GNU inline assembly, __builtin_* intrinsics, or other vendor-specific tokens). Specific checks and reasons:\n\n- PRIu8 usage: PRIu8 is the standard macro from <inttypes.h> for printing uint8_t and is not a compiler extension. Using it inside a format string (string literal concatenation) is standard C behaviour.\n- __VA_ARGS__ in LFS_TRACE: Variadic macros are standard since C99; their use here is a standard-language feature, not a compiler extension.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros: They use the comma operator and (void) casts; both are standard C constructs. The macros themselves contain no compiler-specific syntax.\n- (void*) cast and format specifiers like %p and %s: Standard C features used for printing pointers and strings.\n- No occurrences of vendor-specific tokens or builtins: I found no __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, or other documented compiler extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions used). If you have additional source files or compiler-specific headers/macros not shown here, please provide them for review, since extensions could appear elsewhere."
