  "explanation": "- lfs_removeattr_: The target forwards the lfs and path arguments to lfs_removeattr_. You must inspect its prototype and body to determine whether it (or callees it passes the pointers to) mutate the object(s). If it modifies *lfs or the storage pointed to by path, the non-const parameter is required; otherwise lfs could potentially be const-qualified.\n- lfs_commitattr: Static call graph shows lfs_removeattr_ calls lfs_commitattr. Its declaration/implementation is needed to see whether it modifies the lfs state or any data reachable from the lfs pointer (thus preventing const-qualification).\n- definition of lfs_t (and the exact type of lfs->cfg): To decide whether lfs can be a pointer-to-const you must know the fields and types of lfs_t. In particular the cfg member is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK, so you need the cfg type to check whether locking requires a mutable cfg pointer.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions): These are invoked with lfs->cfg. If their prototype/expansion accepts a non-const pointer or performs mutations, lfs (or at least lfs->cfg) cannot be const. Also if they expand to code that writes into lfs, that prevents const-qualification.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition): The trace call casts lfs to (void*) and passes it to LFS_TRACE. If LFS_TRACE expects a void * (non-const) or the macro forces a cast that drops constness, making lfs const would require discarding constness (a MISRA concern). You must inspect its signature/expansion to see whether making lfs a pointer-to-const would introduce const-discarding casts or violations.\n\nNote: path is already const char * in the target signature; still check lfs_removeattr_/callees to ensure they do not require non-const char* for path (the declaration of lfs_removeattr_ covers that)."
