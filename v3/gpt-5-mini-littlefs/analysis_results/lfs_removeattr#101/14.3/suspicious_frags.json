  "explanation": "The only potential invariant controlling expression in this function is the if (err) test. The initialization of err via LFS_LOCK is included because that macro (per additional code) expands to a constant 0, which would make the if condition invariant. No other controlling expressions are present in the function (no for/while/do-while loops, no switch, no conditional (?:) operators). LFS_TRACE is a no-op macro and LFS_UNLOCK is a void statement, and the assignment err = lfs_removeattr_(...) is a runtime call (not constant), so they do not create invariant controlling expressions and do not need investigation under Rule 14.3."
