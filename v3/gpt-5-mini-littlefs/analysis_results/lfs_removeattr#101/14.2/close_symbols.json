The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_removeattr_: This is the direct callee from lfs_removeattr. The MISRA rule requires that the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. If lfs_removeattr_ contains any for loops (or calls functions that do), its body must be inspected for well-formed for statements and for modifications of loop counters or loop-control objects.\n\n- lfs_commitattr: The static call graph shows lfs_removeattr_ calls lfs_commitattr. Any for loops in lfs_commitattr (or its callees) must be analysed because they are in the transitive call chain of lfs_removeattr_. Include the full definition/body to check loop clauses, loop counters, and side effects.\n\n- definitions (bodies) of all functions called, directly or indirectly, by lfs_removeattr_ and lfs_commitattr: The rule\u2019s scope includes functions called within a for loop body. To ensure no violation, you must inspect the full transitive closure of callees for for-statements and for any objects they modify that could be used as loop counters/flags.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): lfs_removeattr invokes LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If this macro/function expands to or calls code containing for loops or modifies objects that could be used as loop counters or flags, it must be inspected. Also needed to know whether it can modify lfs->cfg or other objects used elsewhere in loops.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/body might contain loops or modify objects visible to loops in callees.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function): Logging macros sometimes expand to function calls or loops (e.g., formatting helpers). If LFS_TRACE contains loops or calls other functions with loops, those must be checked because they are executed in the control flow of lfs_removeattr.\n\n- definition of struct lfs_t and the type of lfs->cfg (configuration type): To determine which objects might be used/modified as loop counters or loop-control flags, you need the types and members. For example, if callees access or modify fields of lfs or lfs->cfg that might appear in for clauses, you must know their declarations to determine whether the for-loop clauses use objects modified in loop bodies.\n\nNotes:\n- PRIu8 (format macro) is not relevant to for-loop analysis.\n- If any of the above macros expand to inline functions or reference other symbols (globals, static variables), include those definitions as well, since the MISRA rule requires checking whether objects used in the for clauses are modified in the loop body (including in called functions)."
