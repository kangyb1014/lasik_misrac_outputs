  "explanation": "All other lines do not modify any function parameter variables. The function signature parameters (lfs, path, type, buffer, size) are only used as values except where their addresses are not taken for modification. No assignment to parameter variables occurs. Taking the address of local variable cwd or passing members (e.g. lfs->root) does not violate the rule because those are not parameter variables; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule's note, and buffer is const so it cannot be modified. Therefore only the call that takes the address of a parameter requires further investigation."
