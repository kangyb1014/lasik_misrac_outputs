Therefore the condition if (err) is statically false and the return inside the block is unreachable. This constitutes unreachable code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_read:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The if (err) branch is defensive code that is intended to handle a non-zero return from LFS_LOCK when locking is actually implemented; it is not inherently or necessarily unreachable across the project. Although the provided macro LFS_LOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg, 0) in the snippet you gave, that macro is a configuration-dependent definition that may be replaced by a real locking implementation that can return non-zero. MISRA Rule 2.1 applies at the project level (i.e. across intended build configurations) and requires removal of code that is provably unreachable in the project; it does not require removal of defensive checks that are reachable under other configurations. Also, ((void)cfg, 0) is not a C integer constant expression in the sense of the language grammar (it depends on cfg syntactically), so static analysis may not treat the condition as a compile-time constant false in a general analysis. For these reasons the report that this code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 is not correct."
