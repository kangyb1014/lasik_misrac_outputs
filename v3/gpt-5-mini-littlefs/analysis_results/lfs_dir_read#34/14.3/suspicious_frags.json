  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. The only conditional, if (err), depends on err which is assigned at runtime from the call to LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). There are no for/while/do-while loops or other conditionals with constant/invariant expressions present. The remaining statements are function/macro calls and assignments (LFS_TRACE, err = lfs_dir_read_(...), LFS_UNLOCK, return) which do not introduce invariant controlling expressions in this snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
