  "explanation": "To determine whether any controlling expression in lfs_dir_read is invariant you must know the actual semantics and expansions of the identifiers used in the function:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The initial controlling expression is if (err) where err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro or function that always evaluates to a constant (or expands to code with invariant control expressions) the if (err) could be invariant. You need the LFS_LOCK definition/implementation to decide.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Even though not directly used in a controlling expression here, its definition matters if it is a macro that expands into control-flow (e.g. an if or loop) \u2014 macros can introduce controlling expressions into the caller after expansion. Include its definition to check for any invariant controlling expressions introduced into lfs_dir_read.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is used twice and is commonly implemented as a macro that can contain control-flow (for example conditional logging macros that expand to if (trace_enabled) ...). Such expansions would introduce additional controlling expressions into lfs_dir_read. You must inspect LFS_TRACE to ensure no invariant controlling expressions are introduced by its expansion.\n\n- struct lfs_t and lfs->cfg type: LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg. The type and layout of cfg (and any accessor macros) may affect how LFS_LOCK/macros are implemented. You need the lfs_t and cfg type definitions to understand how LFS_LOCK is invoked and whether its result can be invariant.\n\n- lfs_dir_read_: You must know whether lfs_dir_read_ is a normal external function or a static inline (or macro) that could be inlined/expanded into lfs_dir_read. If it is inlined/expanded it could introduce additional controlling expressions into the target function; if it is a separate call it does not affect the target function's own controlling-expression invariance.\n\n- Error code macros/constants used/returned by LFS_LOCK and related APIs: To decide if if (err) is invariant you need to know the possible numeric values LFS_LOCK can return (e.g. whether it always returns 0 or a compile-time constant). Include the error-code definitions (e.g. LFS_OK/LFS_ERR_*) used by LFS_LOCK/LFS APIs.\n\nThese symbols (and their definitions/expansions) are the minimal set required to decide whether any controlling expressions in lfs_dir_read are invariant under MISRA C rule checking."
