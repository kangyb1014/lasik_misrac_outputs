  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the lfs parameter is used to perform filesystem modifications (calls to lfs_fs_desuperblock, lfs_fs_demove, lfs_fs_deorphan), so it must be a modifiable pointer and cannot be const. If, contrary to expectation, none of those functions or this function actually modify the object pointed to by lfs, then the rule would be violated and lfs should be declared as const lfs_t *lfs."
