  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. A concrete violation would be: lfs_fs_deorphan is declared to take a non-const lfs_t * (e.g. int lfs_fs_deorphan(lfs_t *lfs, bool)); however the function does not modify the object pointed to by lfs. In that case the parameter (and thus the pointer type used here) should be const-qualified (int lfs_fs_deorphan(const lfs_t *lfs, bool)), so using a non-const pointer would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
