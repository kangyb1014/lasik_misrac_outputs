  "scenario": "The single call site cannot determine conformance. The call err = lfs_fs_demove(lfs); by itself is not a violation. However, a violation would occur if the function lfs_fs_demove is declared as int lfs_fs_demove(lfs_t *lfs) but does not modify the object pointed to by lfs \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared const lfs_t *lfs (and all non-modifying pointers should use const) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
