  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function were not selected because they do not appear to violate Rule 8.13: the parameter 'const void *buffer' is already const-qualified; the explicit cast '(const uint8_t*)buffer' preserves const qualification; the remaining statements (calls, assignments to commit->crc and commit->off, return) are operations rather than pointer-type declarations that would affect whether a pointer should be const-qualified. No other pointer declarations or address-of expressions appear in the snippet."
