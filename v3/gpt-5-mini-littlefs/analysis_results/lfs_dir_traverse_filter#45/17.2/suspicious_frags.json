  "explanation": "No recursive calls are present in the provided code. lfs_dir_traverse_filter does not call itself directly. The only invoked operations are: uses of the LFS_MKTAG macro (which is a tag construction constant-like expression, not a function call in the shown code), and calls to the inline helpers lfs_tag_isdelete, lfs_tag_type1, lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_splice, and lfs_tag_chunk. The supplied inline helper definitions are simple bitwise/shift operations and do not call lfs_dir_traverse_filter or any other functions that could call it, so there is no indirect recursion via those helpers. There are no function-pointer dereferences or callbacks in the fragment that could hide an indirect call back to lfs_dir_traverse_filter. Therefore no code fragments in the provided snippet need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self or indirect calls)."
