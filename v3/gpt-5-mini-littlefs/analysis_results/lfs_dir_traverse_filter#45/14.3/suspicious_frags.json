  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 14.3 targets controlling expressions for selection/iteration statements. The function contains exactly three controlling expressions: the conditional (?:) used to compute mask, and the two if statements shown above. These are the only selection/conditional controlling expressions present (there are no loops, switch statements, or do-while constructs). They are flagged for investigation to ensure they are not invariant in actual use (e.g., due to constant parameters or external guarantees). Other statements in the function (assignments, returns, arithmetic/bitwise operations, and the body statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore need not be considered under Rule 14.3."
