  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) is invariant, the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- struct lfs_file_t: The definition reveals the type, qualifiers (const/volatile), and layout of the flags member (e.g. whether flags is an ordinary int, a volatile field, or a bitfield). This determines if the flags value can legally change at runtime and how the & operation behaves (e.g. sign/width).\n\n- LFS_F_WRITING: The macro's value is needed to see if the mask is a non\u2011zero compile\u2011time constant or 0. If LFS_F_WRITING is 0 then the expression is a compile\u2011time invariant (always false). If it is non\u2011zero the expression might still be invariant depending on flags, so the mask value is required.\n\n- LFS_READONLY: This compile\u2011time macro controls whether the conditional is compiled in. If LFS_READONLY is defined the if(...) branch is removed and there is no controlling expression to inspect; if not defined the if is present. Knowing its definition is required to determine whether the expression exists in the translation unit being analyzed.\n\n- lfs_file_write_, lfs_file_flush, lfs_file_flushedwrite, lfs_file_flushedread, lfs_file_seek_, lfs_file_truncate_, lfs_file_rewind_, lfs_file_open, lfs_file_close: Any functions or code paths that can modify lfs_file_t.flags must be inspected to determine whether file->flags can change (and thus the controlling expression can vary). The listed functions include those commonly involved in changing file state (writing, flushing, seeking, truncating, opening/closing, and their flushed variants). The analyzer should examine these symbol definitions to see whether and how they set/clear LFS_F_WRITING in file->flags (or alter the file object in a way that makes the expression vary).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets an analyst determine (a) whether the controlling expression is present after preprocessing, (b) whether the mask is non\u2011zero, (c) whether the flags field can change at runtime, and therefore whether the expression is invariant (violating MISRA) or not."
