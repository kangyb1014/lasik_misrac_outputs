  "explanation": "The provided function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It only reads structure members, uses a flag test, a conditional compile guard, a macro lfs_max, and returns integer/size values. There is no pointer-based buffer manipulation or string handling in this fragment, so Rule 21.17 (bounds of string handling functions) is not applicable and no code here requires further investigation under that rule."
