  "explanation": "I examined the provided function lfs_file_size_ and the related type definitions. There are no calls to memcmp (nor to strcmp/strncmp or other standard library string-comparison functions), no usage of char* or any pointer to null-terminated strings, and no inclusion of string.h in the shown fragments. The function only inspects integer/size fields and flags and returns numeric sizes/positions. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings), so nothing needs to be investigated for that rule."
