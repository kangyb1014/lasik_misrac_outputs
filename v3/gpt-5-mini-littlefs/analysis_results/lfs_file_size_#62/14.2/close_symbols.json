Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n1) lfs_max\n- The target function directly calls lfs_max. To judge whether the target function (or its called behaviour) contains or invokes any for-loops that could violate the MISRA rule, the implementation of lfs_max must be inspected. Also lfs_max could have side-effects (modify objects) that are relevant if this function is used inside a for-loop elsewhere.\n\n2) LFS_READONLY\n- This preprocessor macro controls conditional compilation of the branch that checks file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING and calls lfs_max. Knowing whether LFS_READONLY is defined at compile time determines whether the potentially different control flow (and any code it pulls in) is present; that affects whether any for-loops or side-effects are reachable in this function.\n\n3) LFS_F_WRITING\n- The flag bit tested in the conditional selects a different execution path. Its definition (value, type, whether it is a macro or enum, and whether it could be volatile) is needed to understand the semantics of the test and whether that test or the flag might introduce side-effects or interact with loop-control objects in any for-loops found in called code.\n\n4) lfs_file_t (full definition)\n- The function reads fields from the file parameter (flags, pos, ctz). You must see the struct definition to know the exact types and whether any of these members are volatile, have side-effecting accessor macros, or are implemented via inline functions/macros that could contain for-loops or modify loop counters. Also the types of pos and flags are needed to reason about expressions used with lfs_max and potential modifications.\n\n5) type/definition of file->ctz and its member 'size'\n- The function returns file->ctz.size (or uses it in lfs_max). You must know the ctz field\u2019s type and member \u2018size\u2019 type and any accessors/macros used for it to determine if reading size has side effects or if that member\u2019s type is a complex object that could be modified elsewhere in ways that interact with for-loop counters.\n\n6) lfs_soff_t (typedef for file sizes)\n- The return type and the types of file->pos and file->ctz.size affect how expressions are evaluated (signed/unsigned, width). Also lfs_max\u2019s prototype will likely use this type. Knowing the typedef is necessary to inspect lfs_max signature and to detect any implicit conversions that might hide side-effects or modifications relevant to loop counters.\n\nSummary\n- Together these symbols let the next analyst determine (a) whether any for-loops exist in this function or in functions it directly calls (lfs_max), (b) whether the conditional branch that is compiled in/out could introduce for-loops, and (c) whether any objects read or written here are or could be loop counters / loop-control flags or are modified (directly or via called functions) in ways that would violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
