  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: lfs_file_size_ simply calls lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size). There is no evidence here that lfs_max is lfs_file_size_ or that lfs_max calls lfs_file_size_ (directly or indirectly). Only if lfs_max were implemented to call lfs_file_size_ (or to expand to a call chain that reaches lfs_file_size_) would Rule 17.2 be violated, but that is not shown in the provided code."
