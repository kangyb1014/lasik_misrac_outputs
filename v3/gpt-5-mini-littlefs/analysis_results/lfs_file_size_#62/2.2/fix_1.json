  "explanation": "Removed the conflicting custom extern prototypes for fopen/fprintf/fclose which conflicted with the standard declarations in <stdio.h>. Instead the code now includes <stdio.h> and uses FILE* for the log file. To make this snippet self-contained and compilable, I added minimal type definitions and a small lfs_max helper and a const for LFS_F_WRITING (avoiding macros). The original function logic, including the (void)lfs no-op and the logging behavior, is preserved."
