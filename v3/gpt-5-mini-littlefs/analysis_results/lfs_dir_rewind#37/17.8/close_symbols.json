  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked in the function and may be a macro (or inline) that expands into code inside lfs_dir_rewind. If it is a macro, it could contain assignments that modify local parameter variables (for example, by reusing the identifier \u2018lfs\u2019), so its definition must be inspected to ensure the pointer parameters are not modified.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 if this is a macro it expands into code inside the function body and could (in principle) assign to parameter identifiers; inspect its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: Typically a macro taking the parameters (void*)lfs and (void*)dir. Because it is a macro it is expanded in-place and could contain code that modifies the parameter variables; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not perform assignments to lfs or dir.\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: Although a normal called function cannot change the caller's local parameter variables (only the objects they point to), its symbol must be checked to ensure it is not actually a macro or inline that expands into code in this function; include its prototype/definition to confirm it is a separate call and does not modify the caller\u2019s parameter identifiers.\n- lfs_t (struct definition): The type/struct definition (and any accessor macros for members such as cfg) should be inspected to ensure that member access (lfs->cfg) does not rely on macros or inline accessors that could alter the parameter variable.\n- lfs_dir_t (typedef/struct definition): Provide the definition so any macros/types hiding unusual behavior for the dir parameter can be ruled out.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any macro expansions or inlined code in the target function body assign to the parameter variables (lfs or dir), which would violate the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
