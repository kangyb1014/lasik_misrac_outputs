The statement is executed but has no observable effect, so removing it would not change program behaviour.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct under the provided definitions. LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) is defined as ((void)cfg), so the statement LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) merely evaluates and discards lfs->cfg and has no observable effect. Removing that statement would not change program behaviour (assuming cfg is not volatile and the expression has no side effects), so it is dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: if cfg evaluation had side effects (e.g. involved volatile accesses or function-like expressions) or if macros are redefined in other build configurations to perform actual unlocking, then in those builds the statement would not be dead. Given the shown macro definitions, however, the report is correct."
