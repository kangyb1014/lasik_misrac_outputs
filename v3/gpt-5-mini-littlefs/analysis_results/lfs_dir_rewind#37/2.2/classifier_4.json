Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_rewind:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_rewind(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_rewind_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_rewind -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_rewind:\nstatic int lfs_dir_rewind_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    // reload the head dir\n    int err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &dir->m, dir->head);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    dir->id = 0;\n    dir->pos = 0;\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_fetch(lfs_t *lfs,\n        lfs_mdir_t *dir, const lfs_block_t pair[2]) {\n    // note, mask=-1, tag=-1 can never match a tag since this\n    // pattern has the invalid bit set\n    return (int)lfs_dir_fetchmatch(lfs, dir, pair,\n            (lfs_tag_t)-1, (lfs_tag_t)-1, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n}\n...\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The LFS_TRACE macro is defined as empty (#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__)), so the statement LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir); is preprocessed away to an empty statement and generates no runtime operation. Because Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour, and here no operation is executed (no code is generated), this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If LFS_TRACE were instead defined to produce code with no effect at runtime, that expansion could constitute dead code.)"
