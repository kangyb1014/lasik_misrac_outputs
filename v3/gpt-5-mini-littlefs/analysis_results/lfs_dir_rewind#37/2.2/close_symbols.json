  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_dir_rewind is dead code (i.e. can be removed without affecting program behaviour) you must know not only that it has no callers in the local static call graph, but also whether it has side effects or is referenced/required elsewhere. Each symbol below is required for that analysis:\n\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: The wrapper immediately delegates to this function. If lfs_dir_rewind_ has observable side effects, error handling, or timing dependencies, removing lfs_dir_rewind could change behaviour. You must inspect its implementation.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: According to the call graph lfs_dir_rewind_ calls lfs_dir_fetch. You need to know if that chain performs observable actions (state changes, I/O, timing) that justify keeping the wrapper or conversely show it is redundant.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The lock macro/function executes before the call and may have side effects (synchronization, error returns). If it is non\u2011trivial, its presence may make the wrapper necessary. If it expands to nothing in some builds, the wrapper\u2019s behaviour changes \u2014 relevant to dead\u2011code determination.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: As with LFS_LOCK, unlocking may have side effects (release of resources, memory barriers). Knowing its semantics is required to judge removability.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace/logging calls can affect observable behaviour (timing, I/O) or be no\u2011ops depending on build macros. MISRA Note 1 explicitly calls out timing as part of behaviour; therefore the effect of removing logging must be known.\n\n- lfs_t (structure definition, including cfg field): The lock/unlock macros and trace use lfs->cfg; the cfg contents and their semantics determine whether calls here are necessary. Also needed to see if lfs_dir_rewind could be referenced via data structures embedded in lfs_t.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (structure definition): The directory object passed by pointer may be stored, mutated, or referenced elsewhere. You must know whether passing/using this object in the wrapper has observable effects.\n\n- declaration/prototype and linkage/visibility of lfs_dir_rewind (header or static/non\u2011static specifier): If the function is externally visible (non\u2011static) and declared in a public header, it may be part of the public API (used by other translation units or by external code), and therefore not dead even if no local callers exist. If it is static or not exported, that affects whether it can be removed.\n\n- project-wide call sites (all references) of lfs_dir_rewind: The local static call graph shows no callers, but you must check the entire project (other TUs, callbacks, function pointer tables, generated code) to find any real uses. Also check for indirect uses (function pointers, registration APIs) that would not appear in a simple static call graph.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols (definitions/macros, prototypes, and global references) lets the next analyzer determine whether removing lfs_dir_rewind would change program behaviour (including timing) and thus whether it violates the MISRA dead\u2011code rule."
