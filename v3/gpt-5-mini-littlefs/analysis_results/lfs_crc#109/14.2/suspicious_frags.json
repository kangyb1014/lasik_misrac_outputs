First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The for-statement header is included because Rule 14.2 concerns the three clauses of any for loop; the exact for(...) line must be inspected to verify the first, second and third clauses meet the rule. The two crc assignment lines inside the loop body are included because Rule 14.2 requires that the loop counter is the only object modified by the third clause and that objects used in the second/third clauses are not modified in the loop body (including via operations inside the body), so the body assignments that modify objects (crc and via data[]) must be checked for unintended interaction with the loop clauses. The closing brace is included to delimit the loop body for review. Other fragments are not included because they do not affect the well-formedness of the for loop per Rule 14.2: the rtable declaration is a static const lookup table (immutable), the data pointer initialization (const uint8_t *data = buffer;) simply aliases the buffer and does not change loop control objects, the function signature and return statement are unrelated to the for-loop clauses, and there are no function calls within the loop body whose side effects would need separate examination for this rule. Therefore only the for header and the statements inside the loop body are necessary to investigate for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
