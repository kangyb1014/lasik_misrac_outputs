The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether the for loop in lfs_crc is MISRA-well-formed we must check that: the first clause defines the loop counter only; the second clause uses only the loop counter (and optional control flags) and no objects that are modified in the loop body; the third clause modifies only the loop counter; and the loop counter is not modified in the body (including via called functions). Each listed symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- i (loop counter): This is the loop counter itself. We must verify it is the single loop counter and that it is only modified by the third clause (i++) and not touched in the loop body or via other means.\n\n- size: Appears in the second clause (i < size). We must verify that size is not modified by the loop body (directly or indirectly) so the second clause does not depend on an object modified by the body. That requires checking whether any operations in the body or any called functions could modify size.\n\n- crc: Modified inside the loop body. The MISRA rule disallows the second clause to use objects modified in the loop body; we must ensure size is not aliased to or affected by crc, and that crc is not the loop counter.\n\n- buffer: The original parameter providing the data pointer. We must check whether buffer (or the memory it points to) could alias size or other objects relevant to the loop clauses, or whether accessing it could have side effects.\n\n- data: The pointer derived from buffer (const uint8_t *). Needed to reason about accesses data[i] and to ensure these reads do not have side effects that could modify loop-clause objects.\n\n- data[i]: The memory read performed each iteration. We must ensure those reads do not cause side effects (e.g., via volatile memory or function calls) and do not modify objects used in the loop clauses (notably size or i).\n\n- rtable: The lookup table used to compute crc. Marked static const in the function; include it to confirm it is not modified (so it cannot violate clause 2/3 requirements via side effects).\n\n- size_t: Type of i and size. Include type information to confirm i is a proper loop counter object (integral unsigned type) and to reason about semantics of i++ and comparisons.\n\n- uint8_t / uint32_t: Types of data elements and crc. Included to confirm that the operations in the body are pure value computations (no hidden side effects) and that no non-local modifications occur.\n\nNote: There are no function calls inside the loop body in the given code. If functions were called from the body, their symbols would also be required to determine whether they have side effects that modify loop-clause objects. Since none are present, no additional function symbols are needed."
