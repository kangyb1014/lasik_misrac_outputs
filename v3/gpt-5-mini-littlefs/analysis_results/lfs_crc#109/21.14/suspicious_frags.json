  "explanation": "I inspected the entire lfs_crc function. It does not call memcmp (or any string-handling functions such as strcmp, strncmp, strstr, or strstr-like variants). The function operates on raw bytes via a void* buffer, an explicit size parameter, and byte-wise indexing and table lookups; therefore there is no comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp. Because Rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and no memcmp or string comparison appears in this code, there are no fragments that need investigation for this rule."
