  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are manifestly invariant and therefore requiring investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale for not flagging any fragments:\n\n- for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++): The loop control expression i < 2 is not invariant because i is modified each iteration (i++). This is a well-formed finite loop, not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- if (err) and if (err && err != LFS_ERR_CORRUPT): Both use the variable err which is assigned immediately prior (from lfs_alloc in the loop or from lfs_bd_read before the second check). These conditions are not compile-time constants nor invariant within their execution context and therefore are not violations.\n\n- if (lfs->cfg->block_cycles > 0): This tests a configuration field. Although the configuration value may be constant at runtime, the expression is not a compile-time constant and is evaluated once here as a normal selection\u2014this is not the kind of invariant controlling expression that Rule 14.3 targets (which is primarily concerned with loop/selection controls that cannot change and thus lead to unintended infinite/empty behaviour). In addition, the rule provides explicit exceptions for legitimate infinite loops and certain do-while constant expressions; neither applies here.\n\nNo other iteration or selection statements are present that evaluate a manifestly invariant expression. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
