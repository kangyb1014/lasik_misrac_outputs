  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Concrete points: \n- The macros use standard C constructs: the comma operator in LFS_LOCK ((void)cfg, 0) is part of standard C, and using (void)cfg to suppress unused-parameter warnings is standard. \n- LFS_TRACE is defined with __VA_ARGS__, which is a standard C99 variadic macro feature, and its empty expansion is valid. \n- The explicit cast (void*)lfs passed to LFS_TRACE is a standard pointer cast, and the format string usage is ordinary C. \n- There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, or other vendor-specific tokens. \nTherefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
