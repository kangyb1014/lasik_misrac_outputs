  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIf the caller supplies a path that is not a NUL-terminated C string (for example: char path[3] = {'a','b','c'}; lfs_remove(lfs, path);), strcspn(name, \"/\") will scan past the end of the provided buffer looking for '\\0' or '/' and thus can access memory beyond the bounds of the object referenced by name. In that situation the call to strcspn can read out-of-bounds and invoke undefined behavior (the same applies to later uses of strspn/strcspn in this function).\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified lfs_remove code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/999.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_remove as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_remove:\n```c\nint lfs_remove(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_remove(%p, \\\"%s\\\")\", (void*)lfs, path);\n\n    err = lfs_remove_(lfs, path);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_remove -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified lfs_remove code.\n",
