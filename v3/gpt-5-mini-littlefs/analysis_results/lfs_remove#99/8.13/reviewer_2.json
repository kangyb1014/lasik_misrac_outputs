If all uses of lfs->lookahead.buffer do not modify the pointed-to bytes (e.g. passed to functions that only inspect bytes, or only used for read accesses), then the lack of const qualification violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not supported by the evidence provided. Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified only when it is actually used read-only; the mere presence of a non-const declaration (uint8_t *buffer) is not by itself a violation. To prove a violation you must show that every use of lfs->lookahead.buffer never writes through that pointer (no assignments to *buffer, no calls to functions that take a non-const uint8_t * and modify the bytes, etc.). The lfs_remove code shown does not reference lookahead.buffer at all, and in the typical littlefs implementation the lookahead buffer is used for allocation bookkeeping and is frequently modified, which would justify the non-const declaration. Without a full inspection showing the buffer is only read, the report is incorrect."
