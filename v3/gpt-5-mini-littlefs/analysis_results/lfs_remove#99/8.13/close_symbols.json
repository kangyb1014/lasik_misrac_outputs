  "explanation": "- lfs_t: Needed to know the exact type of the first parameter and whether any of its members are modified here. To determine if lfs could be declared const lfs_t * (or if some member access/write forbids const), we must see the struct definition and mutability of its members.\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg field inside lfs_t): The code passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. If those expect a non-const object or take its address/mutate it, lfs cannot be const. The concrete type (and whether it is a pointer) is required to determine const-compatibility.\n- lfs_remove_ (declaration/prototype): lfs is forwarded to lfs_remove_. If lfs_remove_ takes a non-const lfs_t * (or otherwise modifies the object), the parameter in lfs_remove cannot be made const. We must see the prototype to check const qualification.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition): Called with lfs->cfg. If this routine mutates the cfg or requires a non-const argument, that prevents making the lfs parameter const. Also needed to see whether it takes cfg by value, pointer, or non-const pointer.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it may require non-const access to cfg or other side-effects that preclude const qualification of lfs.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition): The code casts lfs to (void*) and passes path to trace. We need its signature to ensure no const is being cast away or that the trace macro/function does not require a non-const pointer (which would violate the rule). Checking LFS_TRACE confirms whether the cast or use violates the need for const-qualified pointers.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst determine whether any operations in lfs_remove (direct calls or forwarded calls) require mutable access to the lfs object or its cfg field, and thus whether the lfs parameter could/should be declared const to satisfy the MISRA rule."
