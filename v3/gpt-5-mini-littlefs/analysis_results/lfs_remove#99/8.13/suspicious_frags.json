  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not present non-const pointer declarations that could be readily qualified as const from the shown code: - cfg is already declared as const (const struct lfs_config *cfg). - path is already const-qualified in the function parameter (const char *path). - rcache, pcache, root, seed, gstate, gdisk, gdelta, block_count, name_max, file_max, attr_max, inline_max are not pointer declarations in the provided excerpts. - The LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and LFS_TRACE macro calls only use existing pointers (cfg, lfs, path) but do not declare pointer types; cfg/path are already appropriately const-qualified. - The call site err = lfs_remove_(lfs, path); is a function invocation (not a pointer type declaration) and any needed const-qualification should be checked in the callee's prototype/definition (not visible here). - No other pointer member declarations are present in the shown struct definitions. Therefore only the listed non-const pointer declarations should be investigated for possible const-qualification."
