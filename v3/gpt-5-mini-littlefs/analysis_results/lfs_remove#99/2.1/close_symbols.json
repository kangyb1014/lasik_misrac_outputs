  "explanation": "- lfs_remove_: The call to lfs_remove_ is the key control-flow point inside lfs_remove. If lfs_remove_ is annotated as noreturn, calls longjmp/exit, contains an infinite loop, or otherwise never returns, then the code following the call (the second LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK and final return) would be unreachable. We need the definition/prototype and attributes to determine that.  \n- LFS_LOCK: The early return in lfs_remove depends on the result of LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro or function that can itself contain control-flow operations (e.g., expand to a return, longjmp, or an expression that is constant), this could make code paths in lfs_remove unreachable. Provide its definition so the locking call\u2019s effect on reachability can be evaluated.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: If LFS_UNLOCK is defined in a way that does not return (noreturn, longjmp, exit) or changes control flow, the final return err could be unreachable. We need its definition to rule this out.  \n- LFS_TRACE: Macros used for tracing sometimes expand to statements that could alter control flow (e.g., assert-like behavior, return, longjmp) or be empty. The two LFS_TRACE uses are between control-flow points; their expansions could make subsequent statements unreachable, so include the macro definition.  \n- lfs_t (struct definition, including cfg member/type): The LFS_LOCK macro is invoked with lfs->cfg. To correctly interpret LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) (and whether it can be folded to a constant or have side effects) we need the lfs_t definition and the type of cfg. This also helps detect macro overloading or configuration-dependent behavior that affects reachability.\n\nInclude the exact source definitions (macro expansions, function prototypes/definitions, and any compiler attributes) for these symbols so the analyzer can determine whether any statements in lfs_remove are provably unreachable."
