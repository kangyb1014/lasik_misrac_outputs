  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" we must inspect any expressions that control flow in the target function and any macros/functions that can expand into/control those expressions. Reasons: \n- LFS_LOCK: The target's very first controlling expression is if (err) where err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro or inline function that always returns a compile-time constant or that expands to a control structure with an invariant controlling expression (for example a do { ... } while(0) with a constant condition, an if(0)/if(1), or a constant return), the if (err) in lfs_remove could effectively be invariant. We must see the exact definition/expansion of LFS_LOCK.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although called after the final return, LFS_UNLOCK may be a macro that expands to control structures (and could violate the rule itself). If it is a macro containing control statements with invariant expressions, that must be checked. Also its relation to LFS_LOCK semantics may affect analysis of err if LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are paired macros.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is invoked twice inside lfs_remove. Macros used for tracing commonly expand to conditional code (e.g., if (TRACE_ENABLED) ...) or to do { ... } while(0) wrappers; such expansions can contain invariant controlling expressions or otherwise change control flow. The exact expansion is required to verify there are no invariant controlling expressions introduced by those traces.\n- lfs_t (type) and its cfg member type/definition: LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) passes lfs->cfg; knowing the type and layout may be necessary to understand whether lfs->cfg is a constant/global or subject to compile-time evaluation, and to understand how LFS_LOCK uses that argument in its controlling expressions (if the macro tests fields of cfg that are constant, etc.).\n- lfs_remove_ (function definition): err is later overwritten by the return value of lfs_remove_. To know whether the if (err) previously evaluated was effectively invariant across the function (e.g., if LFS_LOCK always returns the same value and lfs_remove_ cannot change that before the if is evaluated) or if any inlining/inline expansion occurs that could introduce control statements into the caller, we need to see whether lfs_remove_ is a normal function, an inline/ macro, or annotated such that its body could affect the caller. Also, if lfs_remove_ were actually a macro/inline with control statements, those could introduce invariant controlling expressions into the apparent caller.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any controlling expression visible in lfs_remove (including those coming from macro expansions) is invariant, you must inspect LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE and their dependent macros/definitions, the lfs_t/cfg type to understand arguments, and whether lfs_remove_ is an ordinary function or a macro/inline that would affect the caller's control flow."
