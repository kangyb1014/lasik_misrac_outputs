  "explanation": "No direct call to lfs_bd_read is present in this function, so there is no obvious direct recursion. The only potential for indirect recursion is through the configurable function pointer lfs->cfg->read; if that callback were (directly or indirectly) implemented to call lfs_bd_read, Rule 17.2 would be violated. All other calls and operations in the function (memcpy, lfs_min, lfs_aligndown, lfs_alignup, assignments, arithmetic, control flow, and the LFS_ASSERT macro usage) do not invoke function pointers or other functions that could reasonably be the same as lfs_bd_read, and thus do not present a plausible path for indirect self-calls and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2 in this context."
