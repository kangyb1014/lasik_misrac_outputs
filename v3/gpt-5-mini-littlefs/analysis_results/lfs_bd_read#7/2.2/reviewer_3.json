Therefore by the time execution reaches the cache-load path the condition !lfs->block_count || block < lfs->block_count is guaranteed true for all reachable executions. The assertion only reads variables (no side-effects) and is redundant: if LFS_ASSERT is enabled it executes but its removal would not affect program behaviour, and if LFS_ASSERT is compiled out it has no effect.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The LFS_ASSERT is provably redundant given the earlier input validation. At function entry the code returns LFS_ERR_CORRUPT when (lfs->block_count && block >= lfs->block_count). Therefore any reachable execution that gets to the cache-load path must satisfy (!lfs->block_count || block < lfs->block_count). The assertion only reads variables (no side effects) and so executes but can never fail; removing it would not change program behaviour in the sense of correctness of this function. Under the MISRA C 2023 definition quoted for Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), this assertion qualifies as dead code and the report is correct.\n\nCaveat: one can only reach a different conclusion if the LFS_ASSERT macro has observable side-effects (logging, hooks, timing effects that are required for the system), or if you treat timing differences introduced by the assertion as part of the observable behaviour of the embedded system. Given the scenario and the provided definitions (assert only reads variables, no side effects), those caveats do not apply here."
