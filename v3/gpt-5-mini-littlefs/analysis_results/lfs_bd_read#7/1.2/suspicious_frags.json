  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The code uses only standard C language constructs and standard library/types: function pointers (cfg->read), fixed-width integer types (uint8_t, uint32_t, etc.), macros (LFS_ASSERT -> assert), standard library memcpy, and ordinary control flow and declarations. Items that might be mistaken for extensions but are standard C (and therefore not reportable under Rule 1.2 as phrased) include: // single-line comments (C99+), mixed declarations and code (block-scope declarations such as lfs_size_t diff = size; \u2014 valid in C99+), nested/embedded struct declarations, and use of typedefs for integer types. I also saw no GCC/Clang-specific tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) extension, anonymous/unnamed bit-field or union extensions, or pragmas marked as compiler extensions. If you expect the code to be validated against an older compiler standard that lacks C99 features (for example strict C90 without // comments or mixed declarations), then those specific constructs could be flagged \u2014 but per the instruction, only explicit compiler-documented extensions should be reported, and none are present here."
