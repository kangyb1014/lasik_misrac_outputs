  "explanation": "To prove absence (or presence) of direct or indirect recursion we must inspect every function (and macro-expanded function) called by lfs_file_seek and the transitive callees that could call back into lfs_file_seek. Reason for each symbol:\n- lfs_file_seek_: directly called by lfs_file_seek; any call from here back to lfs_file_seek creates indirect recursion.\n- lfs_file_size_: called by lfs_file_seek_; must be checked for calls (direct or indirect) to lfs_file_seek.\n- lfs_ctz_index: called by lfs_file_seek_; must be checked for calls (direct or indirect) to lfs_file_seek.\n- lfs_file_flush: called by lfs_file_seek_; must be checked for calls (direct or indirect) to lfs_file_seek.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: directly called by lfs_file_seek; verify it does not call lfs_file_seek (directly or via other callees).\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: macros used by lfs_file_seek that may expand to function calls or call other functions; include to ensure they do not lead (directly or indirectly) back to lfs_file_seek.\n- LFS_TRACE, LFS_ASSERT: logging/assert macros used in lfs_file_seek; include to confirm they do not expand to code that can call lfs_file_seek.\n\nIf any of these symbols call (directly or indirectly) lfs_file_seek, the MISRA rule would be violated; otherwise lfs_file_seek is not recursively calling itself."
