  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The code assigns err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and then tests if (err). To determine whether the controlling expression if (err) is invariant we must inspect the LFS_LOCK macro/function definition and its expansion (it may be a macro that contains its own control statements or a function that always returns a constant).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although only called after the traces, its definition may contain control structures (e.g. do { ... } while(0)) that introduce invariant controlling expressions; its expansion is needed to check for any invariant control expressions introduced by the macro.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked twice; many trace macros expand to do { ... } while (0) (a constant controlling expression). Because MISRA allows a do-while(0) exception only under specific constraints, we must see the exact expansion to decide compliance.\n- LFS_ASSERT: The call LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(...)) may expand into control flow (for example an if with the negated condition or to a no-op in release builds). We must inspect the macro expansion to see whether it introduces an invariant controlling expression or removes the runtime conditional altogether.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: This function is the operand of LFS_ASSERT. To decide whether the assert's controlling expression (or the call itself) is invariant, we need the function signature/definition to know whether it can return a non-constant value or have side-effects.\n- lfs_file_seek_: The target function immediately calls lfs_file_seek_ and returns its result; while the call itself is not a controlling expression in this function, the static-call callee could be implemented as an inline or macro that changes control flow in the caller or the build could inline code. Provide its declaration/definition to ensure no hidden control expressions appear in the caller after preprocessing/expansion.\n- lfs_t: The type/structure of lfs is used (lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist). The concrete definition may affect how macros (LFS_LOCK, LFS_ASSERT, etc.) expand and whether accesses are constant. Knowing lfs_t avoids false positives about invariant expressions that depend on member types/qualifiers."
