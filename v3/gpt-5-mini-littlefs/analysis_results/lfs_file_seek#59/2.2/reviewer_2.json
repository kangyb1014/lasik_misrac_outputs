  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct for the provided project configuration. With #define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) (empty), the source statement LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_seek -> %\"PRId32, res); preprocesses to a null statement (an empty statement ';'). Executing a null statement has no effect, and removing that statement would not change program behaviour in this build configuration. That matches the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the invocation constitutes dead code in this project configuration. Note: if LFS_TRACE expands to real logging in other build configurations then those other configurations would not have the violation; Rule 2.2 is evaluated against the actual project as built."
