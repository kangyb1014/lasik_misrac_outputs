  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. Its expansion might contain assignments or side\u2011effects that could (a) assign to an expression containing the parameter identifier (unlikely but possible in complex macros), or (b) modify objects reachable from the parameter. To prove the parameter variable itself is not modified, the macro definition is required.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 need the macro/function definition to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameter (or expand into code that assigns to the parameter identifier).  \n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is called with (void*)lfs and (void*)dir; macros with varargs or complex expansions can introduce side effects or temporary assignments. The trace macro definition is needed to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameter variables.  \n- lfs_dir_tell_ (declaration + implementation): This callee is invoked with the parameters lfs and dir. Although modifications inside the callee do not directly reassign the caller\u2019s parameter variables, you must inspect its prototype/implementation to confirm it does not expect pointer\u2011to\u2011pointer (or otherwise cause callers to pass addresses) and to be certain there is no macro indirection that could mutate caller parameters. Include its declaration and body to be safe.  \n- typedef/struct lfs_t (full definition, especially cfg member): The code references lfs->cfg. You need the layout/type of lfs_t and the type of cfg to understand what is being passed into LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK and whether any macro expansions could be mutating the parameter expression (for example if cfg is a complex expression or a macro).  \n- typedef/struct lfs_dir_t (full definition): Provided so the analyzer can confirm that operations in this function (or any macros called) do not assign to the dir parameter itself and to know whether any implicit conversions/overloads could occur.  \n- typedef lfs_soff_t: The return type is used in assignments and tracing; include its definition to rule out any unusual macro/typedef interactions that could affect parameter handling.\n\nProviding these symbols (macro definitions, types and the callee) lets the next analyst determine whether any code expanded or called from lfs_dir_tell assigns to the parameter identifiers lfs or dir (which would violate the MISRA rule) or only mutates the objects they point to (which is allowed)."
