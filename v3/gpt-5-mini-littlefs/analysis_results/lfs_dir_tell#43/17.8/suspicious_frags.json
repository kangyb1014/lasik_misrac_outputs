  "explanation": "No code fragment in lfs_dir_tell modifies either function parameter itself. There are no assignments to 'lfs' or 'dir', and the only uses are: - reading lfs->cfg in LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (the macros expand to ((void)cfg,0) / ((void)cfg) and do not modify the pointer), - casting the pointers for tracing (casts do not modify the parameters), and - passing the pointers to lfs_dir_tell_ (calling another function with these pointers is allowed; modifying the object pointed-to is permitted, but modifying the pointer variable in this function would violate the rule). Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 17.8. If investigation of related code is desired, only the body of lfs_dir_tell_ would be relevant (to check whether it modifies its own parameters), but that is outside the provided function and not required to demonstrate a violation in this function."
