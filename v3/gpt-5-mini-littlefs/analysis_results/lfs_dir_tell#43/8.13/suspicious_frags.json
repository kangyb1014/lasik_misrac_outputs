  "explanation": "The two function definitions above take pointer parameters that are only used for read-only access in the shown code: lfs is unused in lfs_dir_tell_ and dir is only read (dir->pos). These parameters are therefore candidates for const-qualification and should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n\nOther pointer occurrences in the provided snippets are not flagged because they likely require mutability or are already const-qualified:\n- lfs_t::cfg is already declared as const struct lfs_config *cfg, so no issue.\n- Pointer members such as struct lfs_mlist *mlist, struct lfs_dir *next, and lfs_lookahead.buffer appear to represent linked-list links or mutable buffers and are likely modified elsewhere; there is no evidence in the provided code that they could be made const.\n- The casts to (void*) in LFS_TRACE are argument casts for logging and do not indicate that the original pointer declarations should be const-qualified.\n\nIf more code (usages of these pointers elsewhere) is available, further investigation could confirm whether those pointer declarations can be safely changed to point to const-qualified types."
