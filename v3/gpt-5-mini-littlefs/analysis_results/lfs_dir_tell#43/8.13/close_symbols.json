  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, the analyzer must know whether the pointer parameters and any dereferenced members are actually modified or passed to non-const APIs. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_dir_tell_: We must see the prototype and/or definition of the called helper to know whether it accepts (and/or mutates) its lfs and dir parameters. If lfs_dir_tell_ takes non-const lfs_t* or lfs_dir_t* or modifies the objects, the outer function cannot safely change its own parameter types to const.\n\n- struct lfs_t: The function dereferences lfs (accesses lfs->cfg). The struct definition reveals the type of cfg and whether any other mutable members are used elsewhere; it also determines whether lfs itself is modified inside this function or must be non-const because of member usage.\n\n- struct lfs_dir_t: Even though this function only passes dir through, to decide if dir could be const we need the type definition to see if dir has internal mutable state or hidden aliasing that requires non-const access; more importantly, lfs_dir_tell_ may mutate it (see above), so the type is needed to evaluate that.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg field): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg. The concrete type of cfg (and its API) is necessary to determine whether locking operations modify the pointed-to object or require a non-const pointer \u2014 which would prevent making lfs const-qualified.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and symbols it expands/calls: These macros/functions determine whether the cfg argument is passed/modified by non-const APIs. If LFS_LOCK expands to a call that takes a non-const pointer or writes through the pointer, lfs->cfg (and thus lfs) cannot be const.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK and symbols it expands/calls: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking may mutate state or require non-const arguments, preventing const qualification of lfs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: The trace macro/function is passed (void*) casts of lfs and dir. If LFS_TRACE has an API that requires non-const pointers or internally casts away const, that affects whether parameters can be const. At minimum its prototype shows whether it accepts const pointers.\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes/definitions and macro expansions) allows the next analyzer to determine whether any of the pointer parameters or referenced members can be declared const without violating existing API usage or discarding qualifiers (as prohibited by MISRA)."
