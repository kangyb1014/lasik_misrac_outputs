  "explanation": "The LFS_LOCK macro as defined expands to a compile-time constant (0), which makes the subsequent conditional branch impossible to take; therefore the if-block containing the early return should be investigated for unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Other fragments were not selected because they are not inherently unreachable: lfs_dir_tell_ (returns dir->pos) is reachable; LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) is reachable in the normal control flow of the function; LFS_TRACE is an empty macro (no-op) and does not constitute unreachable code; remaining lines are standard reachable statements (assignment of res, return res)."
