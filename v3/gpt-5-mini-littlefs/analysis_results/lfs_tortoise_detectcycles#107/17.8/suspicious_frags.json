  "explanation": "No code fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The only function parameters are the pointers 'dir' and 'tortoise'. The code does not reassign either pointer variable (no statements like 'tortoise = ...' or 'dir = ...'), nor does it perform pointer arithmetic on them. All modifications are to the objects pointed-to (e.g., tortoise->pair[0], tortoise->pair[1], tortoise->i, tortoise->period), which is permitted by the rule. The 'dir' parameter is declared const and only read. The call to lfs_pair_issync passes pointers but does not modify the parameter variables in this function. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate under Rule 17.8."
