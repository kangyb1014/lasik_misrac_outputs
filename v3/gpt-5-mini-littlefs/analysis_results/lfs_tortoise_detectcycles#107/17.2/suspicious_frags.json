  "explanation": "No recursion detected in the provided code fragments. Analysis of the call graph:\n- lfs_tortoise_detectcycles calls only lfs_pair_issync and uses the LFS_WARN macro.\n- lfs_pair_issync is a static inline function that performs only direct comparisons (no function calls), so it cannot cause indirect recursion back to lfs_tortoise_detectcycles.\n- lfs_tortoise_detectcycles does not call itself directly, nor are there any function-pointer parameters or callbacks in the shown code that could introduce indirect recursion.\n\nThe only external symbol used that is not defined here is LFS_WARN (likely a logging macro). Based on the code shown, there is no evidence that LFS_WARN would call back into lfs_tortoise_detectcycles; if desired, a quick check of the LFS_WARN definition could confirm it does not invoke this function. Apart from that, no other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 compliance."
