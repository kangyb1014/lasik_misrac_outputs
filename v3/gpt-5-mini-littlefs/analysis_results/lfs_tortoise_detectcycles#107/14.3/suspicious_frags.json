  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (typically loop conditions). This function contains no loop constructs (for, while, do-while), so there are no loop controlling expressions to evaluate against the rule. Other statements in the function are assignments, an increment, warnings, and return statements \u2014 none are controlling expressions for loops. The two listed conditional statements are the only controlling expressions present; they depend on runtime values (function parameters and struct members) rather than compile-time constants, so other lines do not need investigation under Rule 14.3."
