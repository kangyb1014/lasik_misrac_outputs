  "explanation": "No direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp appears in this snippet. The remaining code consists of assignments (tortoise->pair[...] = dir->tail[...]), integer tests/updates (tortoise->i, tortoise->period), and a logging call with a string literal \u2014 none of which invoke memcmp or compare null-terminated strings via memcmp. The only fragment that could indirectly involve memcmp is the call to lfs_pair_issync(...) (it may internally use memcmp), so it should be investigated. All other lines do not warrant investigation for Rule 21.14."
