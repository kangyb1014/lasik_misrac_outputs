  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided lfs_alloc implementation. Rule 21.17 specifically targets use of the standard string handling functions and possible out-of-bounds accesses caused by them. The code only performs integer arithmetic, bitwise operations, and array indexing guarded by the condition while (lfs->lookahead.next < lfs->lookahead.size), and calls lfs_alloc_scan (whose body is not part of this fragment). Therefore there are no string.h usages here to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If further review is required for string-function usage, inspect other functions (for example lfs_alloc_scan or other modules) where standard string functions might be called."
