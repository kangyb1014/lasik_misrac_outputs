  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameters themselves. The function assigns to *block (writing the object pointed to) and modifies members of the object pointed to by lfs (e.g., lfs->lookahead.next, lfs->lookahead.ckpoint). These are permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). There are no statements reassigning the pointer variables (no occurrences of lfs = ..., block = ..., block += ..., block++ or similar), so there are no fragments that violate the rule and none need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
