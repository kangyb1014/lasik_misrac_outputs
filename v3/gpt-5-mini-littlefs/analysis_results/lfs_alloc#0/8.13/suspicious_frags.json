  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they involve pointers that are intentionally used for modification or are not pointer usages: - The parameter 'block' is written to via '*block = ...' so it must be a pointer to non-const (it is an output). - The parameter 'lfs' is used to modify members (e.g. lfs->lookahead.next, lfs->lookahead.ckpoint), so it cannot be a pointer-to-const. - Accesses and arithmetic on scalar members (lfs->lookahead.start, lfs->lookahead.next, lfs->block_count, lfs->lookahead.ckpoint) are not pointer targets and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. - Return statements and loop-control logic do not involve pointer types that could be const-qualified. The three listed fragments should be investigated to determine whether the lookahead buffer pointer (lfs->lookahead.buffer) or the lfs parameter passed to lfs_alloc_scan could/should be declared to point to const-qualified data."
