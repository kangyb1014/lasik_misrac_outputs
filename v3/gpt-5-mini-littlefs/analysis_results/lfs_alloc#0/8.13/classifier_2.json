  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer lfs is used to modify lfs state (e.g. lookahead.next, lookahead.ckpoint) within lfs_alloc and presumably within lfs_alloc_scan, so it cannot be const-qualified. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that could be made pointer-to-const; here the pointer must be non-const to allow state updates, and the fragment (int err = lfs_alloc_scan(lfs);) does not introduce a pointer that could be const."
