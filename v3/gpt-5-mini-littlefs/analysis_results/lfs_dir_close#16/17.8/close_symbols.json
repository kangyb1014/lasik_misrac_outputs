  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_dir_close violates the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified, the analyzer must be able to see any code that could assign to the parameter identifiers 'lfs' or 'dir' within the function or via macro expansion.  Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with lfs->cfg; if LFS_LOCK is a macro its expansion could reference or assign to the parameter identifier 'lfs' (or 'dir'). The definition is needed to inspect any side effects on the parameter variables.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 macros can expand to statements that might modify parameter identifiers; need the definition to confirm no assignment to 'lfs' or 'dir'.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace macros often expand in-place; their expansion could (maliciously or accidentally) use/assign the parameter identifiers. The macro/body must be inspected to ensure it does not assign to the parameters.\n\n- lfs_dir_close_: The call target might be a function or a macro/inline. If it is a macro or inlinable code it could expand at the call site and assign to the parameter identifiers. Even if it is a function, its declaration shows whether it takes pointer-to-pointer arguments (which could indicate the caller passed addresses capable of changing the caller's pointer variables). The full definition is needed to verify whether any in-place expansion or called semantics change the parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_mlist_remove: According to the static call graph, lfs_dir_close_ calls this symbol. If lfs_dir_close_ is inlined or a macro, lfs_mlist_remove could appear in an expansion that assigns to the caller's parameter identifiers. Include its definition to fully follow any in-place expansions and side-effects.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_dir_t: The parameter types must be known to rule out hidden macro/type tricks (e.g., if lfs_t or lfs_dir_t are themselves macros that expand to something containing assignments, or if they define overloaded behaviour). Also knowing the field layout (e.g., cfg member) clarifies whether member accesses in macros could alias the parameter variable name.\n\n- lfs->cfg member type / definition: LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg; the cfg field's type and name are needed to inspect LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expansions for any assignment that might reference the parameter identifier via that member access.\n\nBy providing these symbols (macro definitions, called-function definitions, and the parameter/type definitions), the next agent can inspect all in-place expansions and callees to determine whether any code assigns to the parameter identifiers 'lfs' or 'dir' in the context of lfs_dir_close."
