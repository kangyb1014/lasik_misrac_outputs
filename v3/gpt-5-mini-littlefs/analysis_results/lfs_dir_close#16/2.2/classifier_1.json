  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_close:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_close:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_close_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    // remove from list of mdirs\n    lfs_mlist_remove(lfs, (struct lfs_mlist *)dir);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic void lfs_mlist_remove(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_mlist *mlist) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &lfs->mlist; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == mlist) {\n            *p = (*p)->next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated: In the provided configuration LFS_TRACE is defined as an empty macro, so the statement is removed by the preprocessor and generates no executed operation. Rule 2.2 concerns executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; since nothing is executed here it is not dead code. (A violation would occur if LFS_TRACE expanded to an executed no\u2011op \u2014 e.g. a call to a function that has no observable effects and whose removal would not change behaviour \u2014 then that executed, removable operation would be dead code.)"
