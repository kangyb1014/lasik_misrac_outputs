  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_close:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_close:\nstatic int lfs_dir_close_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    // remove from list of mdirs\n    lfs_mlist_remove(lfs, (struct lfs_mlist *)dir);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic void lfs_mlist_remove(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_mlist *mlist) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &lfs->mlist; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == mlist) {\n            *p = (*p)->next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n...\nstatic void lfs_mlist_remove(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_mlist *mlist) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &lfs->mlist; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == mlist) {\n            *p = (*p)->next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\np = &(*p)->next\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "In the for loop \"for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &lfs->mlist; *p; p = &(*p)->next)\", the third clause \"p = &(*p)->next\" (and the second clause \"*p\") access the object pointed to by p (i.e. *p), which is assigned to inside the loop body via \"*p = (*p)->next\". This means the second clause reads an object modified by the loop body and the third clause uses an object that is modified in the loop body, violating the requirement that the second clause shall not use objects modified in the loop body and the third clause shall not use objects modified in the loop body (MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2)."
