  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_dir_close violates \"a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" we must know whether the pointers passed into it (and any pointers reachable from them) are mutated or passed to non-const parameters. For that we need: \n\n- lfs_dir_close_ (definition/prototype): lfs_dir_close delegates actual work to this helper. If lfs_dir_close_ modifies data through the lfs or dir pointers (or passes them to APIs that do), then the pointers cannot be const. The implementation/prototype shows parameter types and any writes.\n\n- lfs_mlist_remove (definition/prototype): static call graph shows lfs_dir_close_ calls this function. If lfs_mlist_remove writes through pointers or requires non-const parameters, that prevents qualifying the pointers as const. Its definition reveals whether it mutates structures.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including the cfg member and its type): lfs_dir_close uses lfs->cfg in LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. The cfg member's type and whether those lock/unlock APIs take a const or non-const pointer determines if lfs should be const. Also the structure fields indicate whether callers commonly modify lfs state.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (type definition): to judge whether dir could be const we must know its contents and whether any callees modify those fields.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro/implementation/prototype): these are invoked with lfs->cfg. If these macros/functions require a non-const pointer (or perform modifications), lfs->cfg (and thus lfs) cannot be const; conversely, if they accept a const pointer, that supports const qualification.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/definition): LFS_TRACE casts lfs and dir to (void*) in the call site. That cast may mask constness or indicate the macro expects non-const void*. Inspecting the macro shows whether it discards const qualifiers (e.g., by taking non-const pointers) which affects whether the parameters can be declared const.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets an analyzer determine whether any write or non-const parameter use occurs for lfs or dir (directly or transitively), which is required to decide if they can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
