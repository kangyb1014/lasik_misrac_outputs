  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK, which implies the object pointed to by cfg is used for synchronization/management and likely requires a modifiable (non-const) pointer. Rule 8.13 requires const qualification only when possible; given the usage here (locking/unlocking, potential modification of internal state), making cfg a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate. (If, however, cfg truly referred to immutable configuration data that is never modified, then it should be const-qualified \u2014 that would be a violation.)"
