  "explanation": "The only controlling expression in the function is the if (err) check immediately after the LFS_LOCK call. Given the provided macro definition (#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)), the initialization int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); yields a compile-time invariant value (0), making the controlling expression invariant (always false) at that point \u2014 this is the fragment that should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other fragments do not need investigation: the subsequent assignment err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir); is not a controlling expression, LFS_TRACE is an empty macro (no control flow), LFS_UNLOCK and the final return are not controlling expressions, and there are no loops or do-while constructs in the function that could trigger the rule."
