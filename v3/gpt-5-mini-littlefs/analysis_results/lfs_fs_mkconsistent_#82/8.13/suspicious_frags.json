  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer usage or they clearly require a non-const object: - Declarations/initializations of local non-pointer objects (e.g. lfs_gstate_t delta = {0}; lfs_mdir_t root;) are used as destinations/outputs and are modified by subsequent calls, so they cannot be const. - Simple control-flow constructs and error checks (if (err) { return err; }, return 0;) do not introduce pointer types that could be const-qualified. - The use of the NULL literal as an argument is not an instance of a pointer-to-non-const that could be const-qualified. The suspicious fragments above cover all sites where an address or pointer value is passed or where the function parameter is a pointer; those are the locations that need inspection to determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified."
