  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Cannot determine a definite violation from the single call alone. The fragment shows a call lfs_fs_forceconsistency(lfs) where lfs is declared as lfs_t *lfs in the enclosing function. Rule 8.13 would be violated only if the object pointed to is not modified anywhere (i.e. the callee and the caller treat the pointee as read-only) but the pointer types are not const-qualified. A concrete violation scenario: if the prototype is int lfs_fs_forceconsistency(lfs_t *lfs) and neither lfs_fs_forceconsistency nor lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (nor any callees) modify *lfs, then lfs and the function parameter should be declared as const lfs_t * to conform to Rule 8.13. Conversely, if the filesystem state may be modified (e.g. lfs_dir_commit or other callees update lfs), then making the pointer const is not possible and there is no violation."
