  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically: \n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC attributes (for example __attribute__), no __asm or asm inline assembly, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({ ... }), no nested functions, no __extension__ markers, and no compiler-specific keywords. \n- The use of `static inline` is standard C (since C99) and not a compiler extension. \n- Declaration of a loop variable in the for-init (for (lfs_off_t i = ...)) is standard C99 and not an extension. \n- Fixed-size arrays (uint8_t dat[8]) and passing their address are standard C operations, not extensions. \n- Use of fixed-width types (uint8_t, uint32_t) and standard library functions like memcmp are standard, not extensions. \n- No anonymous structs/unions, no flexible array members with compiler-specific syntax, and no other non-standard constructs are present in the snippets.\n\nGiven the rule (report only explicit compiler-documented language extensions), there are no code fragments here that should be investigated for Rule 1.2."
