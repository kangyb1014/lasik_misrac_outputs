  "explanation": "I selected all uses of the standard string.h functions (memcmp, memcpy) and the call that passes a caller buffer into lfs_bd_read (which performs memcpy and may write into the provided buffer). These are the only places in the provided code that call functions from <string.h> and/or pass external buffers into routines that use memcpy/memcmp. Other code fragments need not be investigated for MISRA C Rule 21.17 for the following reasons:\n\n- The remaining calls to lfs->cfg->read are not calls to <string.h> functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 (which specifically concerns the string.h functions).\n\n- The inline helper lfs_tag_size and simple casts/assignments (e.g., const struct lfs_diskoff *disk = buffer;) do not invoke any string.h functions and therefore do not fall under Rule 21.17.\n\n- The arithmetic and control-flow code (loops, lfs_min/lfs_alignup/lfs_aligndown usage, cache bookkeeping, bound checks such as off+size > lfs->cfg->block_size) are not direct uses of string.h functions; they can affect whether the memcpy/memcmp calls are safe, but the actual string.h usages are already included in the suspicious list for investigation.\n\nI aimed to include every location where memcpy or memcmp is used or where a buffer is passed into a function that subsequently uses those functions, so other agents can inspect whether those calls might access beyond the referenced objects' bounds."
