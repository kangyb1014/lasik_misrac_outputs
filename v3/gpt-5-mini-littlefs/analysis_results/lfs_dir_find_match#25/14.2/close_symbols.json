The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "lfs_bd_cmp: Called directly from lfs_dir_find_match. MISRA requires that the behaviour of a for-loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement, so you must inspect lfs_bd_cmp for any for loops (and whether they obey the three-clause/one-counter constraints).\n\nlfs_bd_read: Called by lfs_bd_cmp (per the static call graph). To fully verify lfs_bd_cmp you must also inspect lfs_bd_read for for-loops and their well-formedness.\n\nlfs_min: Called in lfs_dir_find_match and inside lfs_bd_cmp. Although likely trivial, it must be checked to ensure it does not contain any for-loops (or other side effects) that would affect compliance with the MISRA for-loop requirements.\n\nlfs_tag_size: Called in lfs_dir_find_match to compute sizes. It must be checked to ensure it contains no for-loops (or side effects) that would be part of the called-function behaviour considered by MISRA.\n\nNote: These are the direct callees (and callee of a callee) shown in the provided static call graph. To complete the MISRA for-loop analysis you will need the full definitions/bodies of these symbols (and then recursively any further callees discovered in their bodies) so you can examine any for statements they contain and verify the three clauses and single-counter constraints."
