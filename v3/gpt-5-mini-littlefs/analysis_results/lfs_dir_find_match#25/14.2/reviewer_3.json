First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop in lfs_bd_cmp is written as: for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff). The third clause uses the object 'diff' which is assigned inside the loop body (diff = lfs_min(...)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the loop body. The declaration/initialisation 'lfs_size_t diff = 0;' does not prevent this: the loop still uses a variable modified in the body for its increment, so the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d452c8, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d45240\n  name->size=8, tag_size=8, diff=8\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=8\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=8, res=0\n  post-call name->size=8, tag_size=8\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d452c8, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d45240\n  name->size=8, tag_size=8, diff=8\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=8\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=8, res=0\n  post-call name->size=8, tag_size=8\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=9, tag_size=9, diff=9\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=72\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=9, res=0\n  post-call name->size=9, tag_size=9\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=9, tag_size=9, diff=9\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=72\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=9, res=0\n  post-call name->size=9, tag_size=9\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=4, tag_size=5, diff=4\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=40\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=4, res=1\n  post-call name->size=4, tag_size=5\n  comparison mismatch: res=1\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=9, tag_size=9, diff=9\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=72\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=9, res=0\n  post-call name->size=9, tag_size=9\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=8, tag_size=5, diff=5\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=40\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=5, res=1\n  post-call name->size=8, tag_size=5\n  comparison mismatch: res=1\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=8, tag_size=4, diff=4\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=88\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=4, res=1\n  post-call name->size=8, tag_size=4\n  comparison mismatch: res=1\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d452c8, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d45240\n  name->size=8, tag_size=8, diff=8\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=8\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=8, res=0\n  post-call name->size=8, tag_size=8\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=9, tag_size=9, diff=9\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=72\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=9, res=0\n  post-call name->size=9, tag_size=9\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=5, tag_size=5, diff=5\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=40\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=5, res=0\n  post-call name->size=5, tag_size=5\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=5, tag_size=4, diff=4\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=88\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=4, res=2\n  post-call name->size=5, tag_size=4\n  comparison mismatch: res=2\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=5, tag_size=8, diff=5\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=136\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=5, res=2\n  post-call name->size=5, tag_size=8\n  comparison mismatch: res=2\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=9, tag_size=9, diff=9\n  disk->block=1, disk->off=72\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=9, res=0\n  post-call name->size=9, tag_size=9\n  comparison equal\nfound a match\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=4, tag_size=5, diff=4\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=40\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=4, res=1\n  post-call name->size=4, tag_size=5\n  comparison mismatch: res=1\nlfs_dir_find_match ENTRY: name=0x7ffd29d45240, lfs=0x7ffd29d455d8, buffer=0x7ffd29d451a0\n  name->size=4, tag_size=4, diff=4\n  disk->block=1672, disk->off=88\nlfs_bd_cmp RETURN: diff=4, res=0\n  post-call name->size=4, tag_size=4\n  comparison equal\n\n</execution_log>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_find_match:\nstatic int lfs_bd_cmp(lfs_t *lfs,\n        const lfs_cache_t *pcache, lfs_cache_t *rcache, lfs_size_t hint,\n        lfs_block_t block, lfs_off_t off,\n        const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    const uint8_t *data = buffer;\n    lfs_size_t diff = 0;\n\n    for (lfs_off_t i = 0;

The third clause (i += diff) uses the object diff, which is assigned inside the loop body (diff = lfs_min(...)).
