  "scenario": "The local pointer 'lfs' is declared as a mutable pointer (lfs_t *lfs = name->lfs;). This would be a violation of Rule 8.13 only if the function (and the functions it calls) do not modify the pointed-to lfs_t object \u2014 in that case the pointer should be const-qualified (const lfs_t *lfs = name->lfs;). However, given only the fragment, there is no evidence that the pointed-to object is never modified (it is passed to other APIs and used to access members such as lfs->rcache), so we cannot conclude it should be const here."
