  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The value returned by LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is assigned to err and used in the controlling expression if (err). You must examine the LFS_LOCK macro/function (and any compile-time configuration that affects it) to determine whether it can produce an invariant value (for all calls in typical builds) or expand to code without a real conditional effect.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although used after the returns, LFS_UNLOCK may be a macro that contains control statements; inspect it to ensure no hidden invariant controlling expressions are introduced inside the macro expansion used in this function.\n- LFS_ASSERT: The call LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(...)) likely expands to control-flow (typically an if or do/while). You must know the exact macro expansion (and whether it compiles to nothing in some builds) to determine which controlling expressions appear in this function and whether they are invariant.\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace macros often contain conditional checks (e.g. if (cfg->trace) ...). The macro expansion may introduce controlling expressions inside this function; include it to see whether any such controlling expressions are invariant.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: This expression is the argument of LFS_ASSERT and is itself a controlling-condition candidate (after macro expansion). You must inspect the implementation to determine whether it can produce an invariant result for the given inputs.\n- lfs_t (definition): The LFS_LOCK and lfs_mlist_isopen calls use lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist. You need the lfs_t structure (members and semantics) to reason if those members make the controlling expressions invariant.\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): lfs_mlist_isopen takes (lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file); the layout/semantics of struct lfs_mlist and how file is treated may affect whether lfs_mlist_isopen can be invariant.\n- lfs_file_size_: Although not part of a controlling expression in the target function, include its symbol to confirm it does not introduce or rely on macros that change control flow in the caller (e.g. via longjmp-like behavior) and to be complete about symbols referenced by the function.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let you expand all macros and inspect called functions/fields that produce the controlling expressions in this function, so you can determine if any controlling expression is effectively invariant (and thus a MISRA violation) in the relevant build/configuration."
