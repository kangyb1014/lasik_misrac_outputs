  "explanation": "- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly by lfs_file_size. Inspect its implementation to see whether it calls memcmp (or any string-comparison wrapper) and whether those memcmp calls compare null-terminated C strings.\n- lfs_file_size_: The core computation called by lfs_file_size. Analyze its body for any uses of memcmp (directly or via helpers) that could compare null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_max: Callee of lfs_file_size_. Include it so the full call chain from lfs_file_size_ is visible; although unlikely to use memcmp, confirming this avoids a missed indirect memcmp usage.\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function referenced by the MISRA rule. Include its signature/usage so that any calls found in the above functions can be checked to determine whether they are comparing null-terminated strings (e.g., by examining the pointer types, length arguments, or surrounding code such as strlen usage)."
