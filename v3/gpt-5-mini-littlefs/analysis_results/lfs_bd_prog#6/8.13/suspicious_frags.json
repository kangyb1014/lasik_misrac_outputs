  "explanation": "The other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The parameter 'buffer' and the local 'data' are already const-qualified (const void *buffer and const uint8_t *data). - The pcache parameter and its members are written to (pcache->size, pcache->block, pcache->off, pcache->buffer via memcpy), so pcache must be a pointer to a non-const object. - The memcpy destination (&pcache->buffer[off-pcache->off]) is intentionally non-const because it is written to. - Local pointer arithmetic and temporary addresses (e.g. &pcache->buffer[...]) are used for mutation and therefore are not candidates for const qualification. No other pointer declarations or uses in the function are eligible for adding const without changing semantics, so they are not included as suspicious."
