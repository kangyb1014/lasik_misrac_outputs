  "explanation": "No code fragment uses any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The function only performs pointer traversal and comparisons (using a pointer-to-pointer to iterate the linked list) and does not perform any string or memory block operations that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that are relevant to Rule 21.17 and nothing to investigate under that rule."
