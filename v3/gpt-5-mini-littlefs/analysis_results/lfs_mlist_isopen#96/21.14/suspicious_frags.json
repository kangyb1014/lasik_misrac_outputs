  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in this function. The code only performs pointer comparisons (if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node)) and iterates a linked list; there are no string objects or null\u2011terminated string comparisons, and no other standard library calls. Therefore there are no fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings) to investigate in this function."
