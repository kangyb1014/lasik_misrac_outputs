  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever that is possible (i.e. when the code does not use the pointer to modify the pointed object). In the loop p is only used to read pointer values (test *p and take the address of (*p)->next) and never modifies *p or the pointed-to struct. Therefore p need not allow modification of the pointed-to pointer and could be declared to point to a const-qualified type, e.g.:\n\nfor (struct lfs_mlist * const *p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) { ... }\n\n(or the whole traversal could be written using a const struct lfs_mlist * traversal pointer). Leaving p as struct lfs_mlist ** when it is only used for reads violates the intent of Rule 8.13. Consequently the report of a violation is correct."
