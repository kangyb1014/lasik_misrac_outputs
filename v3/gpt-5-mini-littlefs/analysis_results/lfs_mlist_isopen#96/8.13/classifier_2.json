  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The function only inspects the list and does not modify the pointed-to objects, so the pointer parameters could and should be const-qualified (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *head, const struct lfs_mlist *node). The fragment also contains an unnecessary cast (struct lfs_mlist*)node which would hide or discard const qualification if it were present. Therefore the code fails to qualify pointers as const where possible, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
