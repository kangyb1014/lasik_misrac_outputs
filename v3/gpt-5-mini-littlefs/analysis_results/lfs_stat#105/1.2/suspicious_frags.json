  "explanation": "I inspected the lfs_stat function and the related macro definitions provided. There are no compiler-specific language extensions present. Specifically:\n- No use of GCC/Clang/other compiler extension tokens such as __attribute__, __inline__ (compiler-specific form), __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or other vendor-specific intrinsics appear.\n- The macros use standard C constructs: variadic macros with __VA_ARGS__ (standard since C99), comma operator in ((void)cfg, 0), and (void) casts \u2014 all standard C features, not compiler extensions.\n- Casts like (void*) and the use of standard printf format specifiers are standard C and not extensions.\n\nBecause none of the code fragments use language extensions explicitly documented as compiler extensions, there are no fragments to flag for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
