  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule \u201cLanguage extensions should not be used\u201d we must inspect any macro expansions, casts, attributes or non\u2011standard declarations that actually appear (or are pulled into) the target function. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: the macro or function definition is required because the call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) may expand to compiler extensions (statement\u2011expressions, typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, GCC variadic trickery like ##__VA_ARGS__, etc.). The macro body determines whether the target uses extensions.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/definition could use language extensions and must be inspected.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: this trace macro is invoked twice with format strings and casts; its definition often uses variadic macros or helper functions and may hide compiler extensions (attributes, builtin intrinsics, or non\u2011standard format handling). We must see its expansion/auxiliary functions to judge compliance.\n\n- lfs_stat_ (declaration/definition): although called from the target, its declaration could use non\u2011standard function attributes (e.g. __attribute__, inline asm) or compiler extensions in its prototype that might be considered part of the call site semantics; check its definition for any hidden extensions that could affect the call sequence.\n\n- typedef struct lfs (lfs_t) and definition of its member cfg: the target dereferences lfs->cfg. The type of lfs_t or the cfg member could use anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields with implementation specifics, or other non\u2011standard constructs. We need the type definitions to see if they use language extensions.\n\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg (for example lfs_config): the exact type of cfg may introduce extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bitfields, non\u2011standard qualifiers) used by the macros LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; inspect it to detect such uses.\n\n- struct lfs_info (definition): present in the function signature and used by lfs_stat_; its definition could include non\u2011standard constructs (anonymous members, attributes, packed qualifiers) that should be checked.\n\nThese symbols (macro bodies and the relevant type/decl definitions) are the minimal set needed to determine whether the target function (after macro expansion and considering referenced types) uses any compiler\u2011specific language extensions."
