  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call passes \u2018path\u2019 as const char * (correct) and \u2018info\u2019 as struct lfs_info * which is an output parameter populated by lfs_stat_/lfs_stat, so it must be non-const. The lfs pointer is non-const because the function locks/changes state. Therefore the pointer qualifications are appropriate and Rule 8.13 is not violated."
