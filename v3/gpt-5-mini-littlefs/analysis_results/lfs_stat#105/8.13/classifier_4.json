  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_UNLOCK which presumably manipulates/unlocks resources in the config object, so the pointer must be non-const and Rule 8.13 is not violated. (If, instead, the implementation of LFS_UNLOCK only read from the cfg object and did not modify it, then the function/macro parameter should be declared to point to a const-qualified type and the current non-const usage would violate Rule 8.13.)"
