  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not appear to modify function parameters themselves. In lfs_stat: LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are macros that do not assign to the lfs parameter (their definitions show no modification), LFS_TRACE is empty, and lfs_stat simply forwards its parameters to lfs_stat_ without assigning to them. In lfs_stat_: uses of strchr(path, '/') and lfs_tag_type3(tag) only read from path or use local variables; lfs_dir_getinfo(lfs, &cwd, lfs_tag_id(tag), info) may modify the object pointed to by info (which is permitted by the rule) but does not modify the info pointer itself. Therefore only the function signature of lfs_stat_ (shows path is a pointer parameter) and the call passing &path to lfs_dir_find are flagged for investigation, since passing the address of the parameter allows the callee to modify the pointer parameter itself, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
