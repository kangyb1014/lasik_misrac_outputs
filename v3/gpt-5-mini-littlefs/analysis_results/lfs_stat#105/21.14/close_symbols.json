  "explanation": "- lfs_stat_: Direct callee of lfs_stat. Any use of memcmp that compares path strings will most likely occur here \u2014 you must inspect its implementation to determine if memcmp is used on null\u2011terminated strings or on explicit length buffers.\n- lfs_dir_find: Called by lfs_stat_. It locates directory entries (names). Directory lookup code is a prime place where name comparisons occur; you need its source to see whether memcmp is used to compare C strings (null\u2011terminated) vs length\u2011bounded buffers.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Called by lfs_stat_. It extracts entry metadata and may perform name/tag comparisons or copy operations that use memcmp; include it to check for forbidden memcmp use on strings.\n- lfs_tag_type3 and lfs_tag_id: Called (transitively) by lfs_stat_. These tag parsing/inspection helpers could perform byte/ID comparisons using memcmp. Their implementations must be checked to ensure memcmp isn\u2019t used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function whose inappropriate use is being checked. You must find call sites (and their argument patterns) in the functions above to decide compliance with the MISRA rule.\n- lfs_t and struct lfs_info: Types used by lfs_stat and passed into the callee chain. Their definitions (particularly fields holding name buffers, lengths, or configuration flags) are necessary to understand whether buffers passed to memcmp are null\u2011terminated strings or fixed\u2011length data.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst inspect all reachable code from lfs_stat that could call memcmp and determine if any memcmp invocation compares null\u2011terminated strings (a MISRA violation)."
