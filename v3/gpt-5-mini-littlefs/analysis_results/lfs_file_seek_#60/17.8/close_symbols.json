  "explanation": "- lfs_t (type/struct definition): needed to know whether 'lfs' is a pointer and to inspect fields referenced (file_max, cfg). The MISRA rule forbids modifying the parameter variable itself; knowing lfs' layout ensures we can distinguish lfs (the pointer parameter) from the objects it points to.\\n- lfs_file_t (type/struct definition): required to confirm that pos, off, flags, cache are members of the object pointed to by 'file' (modifying these is allowed) and that 'file' itself is not being overwritten.\\n- struct for file->cache (fields: off, size): to verify that accesses like file->cache.off/size are member writes (allowed) and not macro expansions that could write to the parameter variable.\\n- struct/type of lfs->cfg (at least block_size): to check lfs->cfg->block_size usage and ensure it is a field access on the pointed object, not something that could modify the parameter variable.\\n- lfs_off_t (typedef) and lfs_soff_t (typedef): to verify these are integer types (not pointers) so expressions like (lfs_off_t)off and the compound literal &(lfs_off_t){...} do not take the address of a parameter variable.\\n- LFS_SEEK_SET, LFS_SEEK_CUR, LFS_SEEK_END (macros/constants): to ensure these are simple integer constants (not macros that expand to code which could modify parameters).\\n- LFS_ERR_INVAL (macro/constant): to confirm it is just a return value constant.\\n- LFS_F_READING (macro/flag): to ensure it is a simple bitmask constant used in the flags test and not something that could modify 'file' or its members.\\n- lfs_file_size_ (function prototype/signature): the call lfs_file_size_(lfs, file) must be checked to ensure the callee does not take addresses of the caller's parameter variables (e.g., &lfs or &file) via macro expansion or unusual signature. We need the prototype to confirm it takes copies/pointers only to pointed objects (allowed) and does not modify the parameter variable itself.\\n- lfs_ctz_index (function prototype/signature): required because it is called with the first parameter 'lfs' and with addresses of temporaries/locals. Its prototype shows whether any parameter could alias the function's parameters (e.g., if it were a macro taking '&(lfs_off_t){...}' differently) or if it expects pointers to caller parameters. Also needed to confirm it does not expect e.g. lfs_t ** or lfs_file_t ** which could indicate callers might pass addresses of parameters.\\n- lfs_file_flush (function prototype/signature): needed for the same reason as above \u2014 to ensure the flush call cannot (via its signature or macro expansion) modify the function's parameter variables themselves.\\n\\nIn short: include the struct/type definitions and the prototypes/macros used so we can verify that all assignments and address-taking in lfs_file_seek_ operate on objects pointed to by pointer parameters or on local temporaries/compound literals \u2014 and not on the parameter variables themselves (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
