  "explanation": "I found no code that assigns to the function's formal parameters (lfs, file, off, whence). The only writes are to objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g. file->pos, file->off, file->cache.*), which MISRA Rule 17.8 explicitly allows (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). Local variables are used and modified (npos, noff, oindex), and compound/local objects are passed by address to lfs_ctz_index (&(lfs_off_t){...} and &noff) \u2014 these modify the temporary/local objects, not the function parameters themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation regarding that rule."
