  "explanation": "I did not flag any other fragments because they use standard, non\u2011extension C constructs: fixed-width integer types (uint32_t, int32_t, etc.), casts, struct and pointer usage, #ifdef conditional compilation, normal function calls, and bitwise/arithmetical operations. There are no GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__ annotations, inline assembly, typeof, or other compiler-specific extensions elsewhere in the function. The only items that may rely on compiler-specific language extensions or a particular C dialect are the compound literal usage and the related local declarations inside the if-block; these should be checked against the target compiler documentation (or the selected C language standard) to verify they are not considered extensions in the build configuration."
