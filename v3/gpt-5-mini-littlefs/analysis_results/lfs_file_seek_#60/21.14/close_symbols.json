  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- lfs_file_size_: Called directly from lfs_file_seek_ when whence==LFS_SEEK_END. If lfs_file_size_ (or anything it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, that would be a violation reachable from the target function.\n- lfs_ctz_index: Called directly from lfs_file_seek_ to compute cache indexes. memcmp could be used inside it (or in things it calls) so it must be inspected.\n- lfs_file_flush: Called directly before updating file->pos. Flush logic often compares buffers/metadata; any memcmp use inside it would be semantically reachable from lfs_file_seek_.\n- lfs_max: Callee of lfs_file_size_ (and lfs_file_flush). Included because it is in the transitive call graph and could contain memcmp usage.\n- lfs_popc: Callee of lfs_ctz_index. Included to cover memcmp occurrences in this transitive path.\n- lfs_cache_drop: Callee of lfs_file_flush. Cache operations may compare memory; include to check for memcmp usage.\n- lfs_file_flushedread: Callee of lfs_file_flush. I/O related helper that may perform comparisons; include for inspection.\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Callee of lfs_file_flush. Same rationale as flushedread.\n- lfs_bd_flush: Callee of lfs_file_flush. Block-device flush helper \u2014 include to ensure no memcmp misuse.\n- lfs_file_relocate: Callee of lfs_file_flush. Relocation code may compare metadata or strings; include for completeness.\n- memcmp: The standard library symbol being restricted by the MISRA rule. The analysis must search for uses of memcmp in the above functions (direct and transitive) and determine whether any use compares null-terminated strings.\n\nNotes:\n- The listed symbols cover the direct callees of lfs_file_seek_ and their transitive callees per the provided static call graph. Inspecting these symbols (and occurrences of memcmp inside them) is sufficient to determine whether lfs_file_seek_ can reach a memcmp that compares null-terminated strings.\n- Other callers of lfs_file_seek_ are not needed to decide whether the target function itself (and its callees) violate the rule, so they are omitted."
