  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/function used at the start (LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). Its expansion could contain assignments or side-effects that refer to the parameter name or otherwise modify the parameter object; need its definition to prove it does not modify the parameter variable lfs or block_count.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: macro/function used before return. Its expansion might modify arguments or use the parameter identifier; include to ensure it does not reassign the parameter variable.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro used with (void*)lfs and block_count. Macros can expand to complex expressions; include to confirm the macro does not modify the parameter variables (for example via unexpected assignment to an identifier).\n- lfs_fs_grow_: the callee invoked with the parameters. While modifications to a callee's own parameters do not violate the MISRA rule for the caller, lfs_fs_grow_ could be a macro or inline that expands into code in the caller context and could therefore modify the caller's parameters. Include its definition to determine whether the call is a simple call or an expansion that could modify lfs or block_count.\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): need the definition of the lfs parameter type to ensure lfs is a normal pointer variable and to inspect the cfg member expression (lfs->cfg). If lfs_t is a macro, or if lfs is defined in an unusual way, this could affect whether the parameter itself is being modified.\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): need the underlying type of block_count to ensure it is not a modifiable lvalue type (e.g., a reference-like macro/type) and to verify that uses (casting/printing) cannot modify the parameter itself.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether any of the invoked macros/functions or type definitions could modify the formal parameters (the pointer variable lfs or the scalar block_count) in the context of lfs_fs_grow, thereby violating the MISRA rule."
