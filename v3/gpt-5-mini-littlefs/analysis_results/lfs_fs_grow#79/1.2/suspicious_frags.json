  "suspicious_frags": [
    "LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_grow -> %d\", err);",

  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses only standard C constructs: the function signature, local variable declaration (int err), the if (err) return pattern, the (void*) cast, the call to lfs_fs_grow_(lfs, block_count), and return err are all standard C and do not by themselves indicate use of compiler language extensions. The use of PRIu32 in the format string is the standard inttypes.h macro (C99) and the adjacent-string literal concatenation is standard C; these do not require investigation for compiler-specific extensions. The flagged fragments are macro invocations (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE) which may expand to implementation- or compiler-specific constructs (for example statement-expressions, attributes, inline assembly, or other compiler extensions) and therefore should be investigated further. No other lines in the provided snippet show signs of language extensions."
