  "scenario": "No language extension is used in the fragment: LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); is a standard macro invocation using member access (lfs->cfg) and a semicolon. This does not itself employ any compiler-specific language extensions. (Only if the LFS_UNLOCK macro expands to a compiler-specific extension would a violation occur, but that expansion is not shown.)"
