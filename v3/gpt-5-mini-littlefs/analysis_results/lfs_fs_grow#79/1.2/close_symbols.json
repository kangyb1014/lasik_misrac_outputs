  "explanation": "You must inspect these symbols because the target function itself is trivial but relies on macros, typedefs and a callee that can hide compiler-specific language extensions. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): The call is the first operation in the function. If LFS_LOCK is a macro it may use compiler extensions (e.g. GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline assembly, __attribute__, or non-standard variadic behaviour). If it is an inline function it may still use attributes/extension syntax. We must see its definition to determine whether an extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK for possible hidden extensions in its implementation or macro expansion.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): The function uses LFS_TRACE with a format string and arguments. LFS_TRACE is very likely a macro that can use variadic macro features, token-pasting tricks (##__VA_ARGS__), statement-expressions, or compiler attributes (e.g. __attribute__((format(...)))) or other compiler-specific constructs. Its definition must be inspected to detect any explicit compiler language extensions.\n\n- lfs_t (struct definition, including type of cfg field): The code accesses lfs->cfg. The exact type of cfg may determine how LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are invoked (e.g. if they expand to operations that rely on specific compiler extensions tied to that type). Also typedefs/struct declarations could themselves use non-standard keywords or attributes.\n\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): The parameter type may be an alias to a compiler-provided extended type (e.g. extended integer types) or use compiler-specific typedefs/macros; its definition must be checked for extensions.\n\n- PRIu32 (format macro from <inttypes.h>): The format macro is used inside the format string. While PRIu32 is part of the standard C headers, projects sometimes reimplement or redefine such macros. You must check its definition (or the included header) to ensure no non-standard extension is being pulled in or that the project isn't using a custom, non-standard replacement.\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_ (declaration and/or definition): Although the target simply calls this function, it could be a macro or inline function that uses extensions, or its prototype could use non-standard attributes. Inspecting its declaration/definition ensures the call site does not indirectly rely on language extensions.\n\nIn short: macros are the primary risk for hidden language extensions, so include their definitions; typedefs/structs and the callee must also be checked to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used."
