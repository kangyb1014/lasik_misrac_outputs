  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required to check for unreachable code in lfs_fs_grow:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The initial control flow depends entirely on the return value of LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro or function that always returns a constant (or performs a non-returning action), the rest of the function may be unreachable. You must inspect its definition/semantics (return values, side effects, possible non-returning behavior) to determine reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Appears after the call to lfs_fs_grow_ and before the final return. If LFS_UNLOCK is defined in a way that affects control flow (e.g., contains a return, longjmp, assert that aborts), it can make later code unreachable. Its definition is required to prove the reachability of the final return and to check for unreachable cleanup code.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros can expand to statements that alter control flow (e.g., return, goto, abort) in some builds/configurations. Both invocations in this function (before and after the call) must be inspected to ensure they do not render following code unreachable.\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_: The core operation called by lfs_fs_grow. If lfs_fs_grow_ is declared/defined as non-returning (noreturn), calls exit/longjmp, or contains infinite loops, then the code after the call (the trailing LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return) would be unreachable. Its prototype and implementation (or attributes) are required to determine reachability.\n\n- lfs_t (structure and its cfg member): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg. The type and layout of lfs_t and its cfg member may influence how the lock macros are expanded or whether passing cfg has side effects. Inspecting lfs_t and the cfg member type helps understand the semantics of LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and whether any compile-time constants make branches unreachable.\n\n(PRIu32 and the printf format are not required for reachability analysis; they do not affect control flow.)"
