The subsequent controlling expression if (err) therefore becomes if (0) (always false) which is an invariant controlling expression and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The assignment statement itself is not a controlling expression, but it produces an invariant controlling expression later; the allowed exceptions (infinite loops or the permitted do-while pattern) do not apply to this if-statement.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_sync:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Given the provided macro definition LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0), the assignment int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); always yields 0. The subsequent controlling expression if (err) therefore evaluates to a constant false (invariant). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions, and none of the permitted exceptions (infinite-loop use or the specific do-while constant-false pattern) apply to this if-statement. (One possible counter-argument is that in other build configurations LFS_LOCK may be defined differently, but based on the supplied macro definition in the translation unit the reported violation is valid.)"
