  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" we must determine whether any controlling expression in lfs_file_sync is a compile\u2011time or otherwise invariant expression. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - The variable err is initialized from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). Whether the if (err) is invariant depends entirely on what LFS_LOCK expands/returns. If LFS_LOCK is a macro that expands to a constant (or to an expression that the compiler can prove constant) then the controlling expression becomes invariant. We need the full definition/semantics of LFS_LOCK (macro or function) to decide.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - LFS_UNLOCK is not directly the controlling expression, but its definition can reveal paired macro/function behavior with LFS_LOCK (e.g. both are no-ops in some configurations). If both are compile\u2011time no-ops returning constants, that supports a determination that if (err) is invariant. Include its definition for completeness.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT\n  - LFS_ASSERT may be a macro that expands to control flow (for example, an if that calls an error handler, or it may be compiled out). Macros that introduce control statements into the function body can create additional controlling expressions that must be checked for invariance. Also the expression passed to LFS_ASSERT (the lfs_mlist_isopen call) might itself be a constant in some builds; we need the macro definition to see whether it contributes any controlling expressions.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  - Tracing macros sometimes expand to conditional code (e.g. if (trace_enabled) printf(...)) or to nothing. If LFS_TRACE expands to an if-statement or similar, that is another controlling expression to inspect for invariance. Obtain its definition to be sure no hidden invariant control is introduced by macro expansion.\n\n- lfs_t (structure definition and its cfg member)\n  - The argument to LFS_LOCK is lfs->cfg. We must know the type and possible compile-time constness of lfs->cfg (and whether lfs is a compile-time constant in any build) to judge whether LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) could be a constant. The structure definition also shows if any fields are #define'd or conditioned in ways that affect macro expansion.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen\n  - Although used only inside LFS_ASSERT, we need its prototype/semantics to determine whether the expression passed to the assertion could be invariant. If LFS_ASSERT expands to runtime checks this may be irrelevant, but if LFS_ASSERT is compiled out and lfs_mlist_isopen is still used elsewhere, its behavior could bear on whether any controlling expressions are invariant across builds.\n\nNote: lfs_file_sync_ is not required to decide whether the if (err) controlling expression is invariant because err is evaluated before that call; however, include LFS_LOCK/LFS_ASSERT/LFS_TRACE and the lfs_t/cfg definitions above to correctly determine whether any controlling expression in the expanded function is invariant."
