  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or function invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If it is a macro, it is expanded in the caller and could contain plain identifiers or assignments that refer to the parameter name (e.g. refer to or assign to 'lfs' or 'file'). To determine whether the parameter variables themselves are modified you must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition. If it is a function, it cannot change the caller's parameter variables directly, but the definition still confirms that.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 inspect its definition (macro vs function) to ensure it does not expand to code that assigns to the parameter identifiers.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is invoked with (void*)lfs and (void*)file. As a macro it could expand to code that references or assigns the identifier names used in the caller; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not modify the parameter variables.\n- lfs_file_rewind_ (definition): The call to lfs_file_rewind_ could be a real function or a macro/inline that expands in the caller. If it is a macro/inline that expands into code referencing the caller's parameter identifiers, it might modify them. Inspecting its definition ensures it does not modify the parameter variables. If it is a normal function, it cannot change the caller's local parameter variables (only objects they point to).\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): Needed to understand the lfs->cfg member and to see whether any macro expansions or inline code operate on the lfs object vs the lfs pointer itself. Also to confirm there are no strange overloaded identifiers/conflicts.\n- lfs_file_t (type/typedef/struct definition): Needed for the same reasons as lfs_t \u2014 to check how macros/functions may operate on the file object and to confirm whether any expansion could target the pointer variable rather than the object it points to.\n\nIn short: macros expand in the caller and can reference caller identifiers, so all macros used here must be inspected. Also ensure callees are not macros/inline expansions that could modify the parameter variables; type/struct definitions help interpret any field-based assignments (lfs->cfg) to distinguish pointer-object modification (allowed) from modifying the parameter variables themselves (disallowed)."
