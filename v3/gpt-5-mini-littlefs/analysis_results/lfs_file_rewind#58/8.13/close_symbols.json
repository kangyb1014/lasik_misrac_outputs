  "explanation": "- lfs_t: the pointer parameter type; need its typedef/struct to know whether members are const-qualified or whether the entire object could/should be const (and to inspect the cfg member type).\n- lfs_file_t: the file parameter type; necessary to determine if the pointer could be to const data (i.e., whether file is mutated) and whether its pointed-to type is/should be const-qualified.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: the called helper\u2019s prototype/implementation; the target only forwards lfs and file to it, so its signature and body determine whether the pointers are used/modified (which prevents qualifying them const in the caller).\n- lfs_file_seek_: lfs_file_rewind_ calls this function (per the static graph); its prototype/implementation is needed to see whether lfs or file are modified further down the call chain (transitively preventing const qualification in the top-level parameters).\n- LFS_LOCK: macro or function used with lfs->cfg; its declaration/signature shows whether cfg (and therefore lfs) must be non-const to satisfy the lock interface.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 to see whether unlocking requires a non-const cfg/lfs.\n- LFS_TRACE: the tracing macro is invoked with explicit casts (void*)lfs and (void*)file. Its definition is needed to determine whether it strips/needs non-const pointers (or causes casts that discard const), which affects whether the parameters can be const-qualified.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg member in lfs_t): the concrete type of cfg (often passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK) to check whether those APIs accept const pointers or require mutable cfg.\n\nProviding these symbols (typedefs, prototypes and macro definitions/implementations) lets the analyzer determine whether lfs and file could be declared as pointers-to-const or whether downstream uses/macro interfaces require non-const, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer targets."
