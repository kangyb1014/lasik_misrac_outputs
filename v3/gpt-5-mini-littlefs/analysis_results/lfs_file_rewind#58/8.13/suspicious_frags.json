  "explanation": "I flagged all pointer declarations and uses in the provided code that could plausibly be const-qualified and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: function parameters of pointer type (declarations of lfs_file_rewind, lfs_file_rewind_, lfs_file_seek_), explicit passes of addresses (the compound literal &(lfs_off_t){...} and &noff), and struct pointer members (lookahead.buffer and lfs_file::next). I did not flag: - pointers that are already const-qualified (for example lfs->cfg and file->cfg), - macros and casts used purely for tracing/locking (LFS_TRACE, LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK) since they either cast for diagnostics or do not change qualification, and - non-pointer members and obvious mutable state (e.g. numeric fields, arrays) because Rule 8.13 concerns pointer-to-type qualification only. Also I did not mark pointer parameters as non-suspicious when the shown code clearly modifies the pointed objects (e.g. file->pos is updated in lfs_file_seek_), since such uses legitimately require non-const pointers."
