  "explanation": "The compilation error was caused by redeclaring LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK prototypes that conflicted with existing macros (the macro expansion made the declarations syntactically invalid). I removed those prototype lines to avoid the macro collision. I added the missing typedefs/forward-declaration for lfs_t and lfs_file_t and declared the internal lfs_file_rewind_ as extern so the function compiles and keeps the original logic intact. No macros, main(), or mock functions were added."
