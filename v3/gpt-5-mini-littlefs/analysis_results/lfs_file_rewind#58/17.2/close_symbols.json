  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: the immediate callee of the target. You must examine its body to see whether it calls back to lfs_file_rewind (directly) or to other functions that form a cycle (indirect recursion).\n- lfs_file_seek_: shown as a callee of lfs_file_rewind_. You must analyze its implementation to determine whether it calls lfs_file_rewind, lfs_file_rewind_, or any other function that eventually leads back to the target (indirect recursion).\n- (transitive) all functions called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_file_seek_: recursion can be indirect and may involve several hops. The full transitive closure of callees from lfs_file_seek_ is required to prove absence or presence of a cycle.\n- lfs_t (type/struct) and lfs_file_t (type/struct): their definitions are needed to detect any function pointers or callbacks stored in these structures that could be invoked by callees and that might point back to lfs_file_rewind or its helpers (another form of indirect recursion).\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function definitions): although locking macros typically do not induce recursion, if they expand to function calls (or call hooks) there is a theoretical path back to the target. Provide their definitions to rule out such indirect calls.\n\nProvide the full source (or prototypes and static call graph) for the listed functions and the type/macro definitions so the next analysis can compute the complete call graph and determine whether any cycle (direct or indirect recursion) exists."
