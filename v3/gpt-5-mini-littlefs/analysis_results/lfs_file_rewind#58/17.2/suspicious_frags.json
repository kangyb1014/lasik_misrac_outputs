  "explanation": "I selected every function-call expression present in the provided code fragments that could participate in a direct or indirect call cycle: the lock/unlock macros (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK), the public wrapper call to lfs_file_rewind_, and all calls inside lfs_file_rewind_ and lfs_file_seek_ (lfs_file_seek_, lfs_file_size_, lfs_ctz_index, lfs_file_flush). These call sites are the only points where control transfers to other functions and thus the only locations that can form direct or indirect recursion. Other parts of the code (assignments, comparisons, early returns, cache/index arithmetic, constant returns such as \"return npos;\" or \"return 0;\", and the LFS_TRACE logging lines) do not perform function calls that could create a recursion cycle and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. The duplicated lfs_file_seek_ body in the additional code is identical to the one already inspected, so no extra fragments are required for completeness."
