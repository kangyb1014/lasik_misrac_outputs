  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - The target function assigns its first controlling expression operand from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg): int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); and immediately tests if (err). To decide if the controlling expression if (err) is invariant you must know the exact definition/expansion and behaviour of LFS_LOCK (macro or function), its possible return values, and whether its result can vary at run time. If LFS_LOCK is a macro that always returns a constant (or is compiled out), the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - Although not directly used in a controlling expression here, the unlock macro/function may be paired with LFS_LOCK and its definition can show whether locking is a no-op in some configurations (making LFS_LOCK constant). Also some implementations encode error/side-effect semantics via paired lock/unlock macros; knowing LFS_UNLOCK helps interpret the locking infrastructure and compile-time configuration that could render LFS_LOCK invariant.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  - LFS_TRACE is invoked twice with err and other values. If LFS_TRACE is implemented as a macro that alters control flow or expands to expressions that affect evaluation (for example, wrapping code in do/while or conditional compilation), that could change whether some expressions are considered invariant or if side-effects exist. Its definition is needed to be sure it doesn't introduce hidden controlling expressions or constant-folding that affect invariance analysis.\n\n- lfs_file_rewind_\n  - This is the direct callee. The target function assigns err = lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file) and returns err. While the immediate controlling expression if (err) is based on the earlier LFS_LOCK result, a complete MISRA check of the target function often requires inspecting callees for control-flow constructs that might be inlined or macro-expanded, and to ensure no controlling expressions in the overall logical operation are invariant due to interactions across calls. At minimum, the callee\u2019s prototype/implementation is required to know whether it can alter program state in ways that affect invariance reasoning (for example, modifying cfg or global state used by LFS_LOCK).\n\n- lfs_file_seek_\n  - Static call graph shows lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_. To fully analyze lfs_file_rewind_ (the callee of the target) for any invariant controlling expressions that could propagate back to the caller\u2019s observable behaviour, the caller of that callee (and its callees) should be available. This is required if the analysis must include the entire close-call context rather than just the target function body.\n\n- struct lfs_t\n  - The target function takes lfs_t *lfs and uses lfs->cfg. The type definition of lfs_t is required to know the exact type and layout of cfg, and whether lfs contains other fields or helpers used by macros (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE). If cfg is embedded differently across configurations, LFS_LOCK behaviour could be invariant in some builds.\n\n- struct lfs_file_t\n  - The file parameter is passed to lfs_file_rewind_. Its type definition is needed when inspecting the callee(s) (lfs_file_rewind_, lfs_file_seek_) to determine whether they access or modify file state that could influence controlling expressions (for example, make an earlier test always true/false).\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration structure, e.g. struct lfs_config)\n  - LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. The concrete config type (and its compile-time options/fields) is often how locking behaviour is controlled (e.g., lock function pointer NULL, macro selecting no-lock behaviour). Knowing that type and its relevant fields/macros is necessary to decide whether LFS_LOCK can be a compile-time/no-op (and thus produce an invariant result) or whether it can vary at run time.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the controlling expression(s) in lfs_file_rewind are invariant you must inspect the lock/unlock/trace macros/functions and the data types they use, plus the direct callee lfs_file_rewind_ (and its callees) because these symbols and types control runtime variability that can make \"if (err)\" either variant or effectively constant under some build/configuration options."
