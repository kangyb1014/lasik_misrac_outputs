  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions listed above because the target function itself only performs macro calls, casts and a call to lfs_file_rewind_. MISRA rule about \"language extensions should not be used\" requires checking whether any compiler-specific extensions are used in those macros, types or the called function declaration/definition. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros (or inline wrappers) invoked in the target. Their expansions may contain compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __extension__, inline asm, __builtin_* intrinsics, nonstandard attributes, nested functions, or other vendor-specific constructs). You need the macro bodies to detect any such use.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: this tracing macro is variadic in appearance and often implemented with token-pasting or special handling of zero arguments (e.g. the GCC '##__VA_ARGS__' extension). Its implementation could also use statement-expressions, __attribute__((format)), or other compiler-specific extensions. Inspect its definition to decide if it uses documented compiler extensions.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: the types of the function parameters may themselves be defined using language extensions (anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific attributes on fields or types, bit-field extensions, typeof-based constructs, flexible array use with extensions). You need their definitions to ensure the types used in the function signature are standard C only.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg typedef/struct): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are passed lfs->cfg; the cfg type or its members might use extensions (function pointer attributes, nonstandard calling conventions, attribute-packed, or macros that expand to extension code). Inspect that type/definition.\n\n- declaration/definition of lfs_file_rewind_: the prototype or body of the called function may carry compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__ on the declaration, K&R style declarations, inline assembler, etc.) and the call might rely on such extensions. You need to see its declaration/definition to be sure the call site in the target function does not rely on an extension.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether any language extensions are present in the code paths invoked by the target function (macro expansions, parameter types, or called function declarations)."
