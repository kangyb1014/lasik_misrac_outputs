  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The code only reads the parameters and passes pointer parameters to other functions (lfs_cache_drop, lfs_bd_flush, and lfs->cfg->sync). Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter (via those called functions) is permitted by Rule 17.8; what is prohibited is changing the value of the parameter itself (e.g., reassigning lfs, pcache, rcache, or validate), which does not occur here. The local variable err and the use of LFS_ASSERT are unrelated to modifying parameters."
