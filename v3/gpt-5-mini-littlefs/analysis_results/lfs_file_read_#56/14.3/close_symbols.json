  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking MISRA C 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant':\n\n- LFS_ASSERT\n  - The macro expansion determines whether the controlling expression in the assert is a runtime conditional or compiled away (or transformed). MISRA treats runtime controlling expressions; if LFS_ASSERT expands to nothing or to a compile-time-only construct then the apparent controlling expression may not exist at runtime. We must see the exact macro to decide if the expression is an invariant runtime check.\n\n- LFS_O_RDONLY\n  - The constant used in the asserted expression ((file->flags & LFS_O_RDONLY) == LFS_O_RDONLY) is needed to determine the bitmask value tested and therefore whether that test can be invariant (always true/false) for files in normal usage.\n\n- LFS_F_WRITING\n  - The bit tested in the if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) expression; its value/definition (bit position) is required to reason about whether the test can be invariant and to interpret the flags field semantics.\n\n- LFS_READONLY\n  - This preprocessor symbol controls whether the whole write-flush branch is compiled in. To decide if there is a runtime controlling expression to check, we must know whether LFS_READONLY can be defined (i.e. whether the if(...) branch exists in the built code).\n\n- struct lfs_file_t (definition, specifically the flags member and its type/qualifiers)\n  - We must know the declaration of file->flags (type, signedness, volatile/const qualifiers, bitfields) to determine whether the flags value can change at runtime (e.g. via side effects, is volatile) and thus whether the controlling expressions can be invariant. If flags is const or a compile-time constant, the test could be invariant.\n\n- lfs_file_flush (declaration/definition)\n  - The called function could mutate file->flags (or other global state) in other code paths; inspecting its implementation shows whether flags can be changed elsewhere, which affects whether the tested condition might be invariant across program lifetime or can vary. Also the body will reveal side effects that can make the controlling expression meaningful.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread (declaration/definition)\n  - Although called after the tests, its implementation can show whether it relies on or modifies the same flags/state; for completeness we need to see whether the read path affects or depends on the flags, which informs whether the earlier tests are expected to vary.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to decide if the two controlling expressions in lfs_file_read_ (the LFS_ASSERT expression and the if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) test) are runtime-variant or effectively invariant in the compiled program."
