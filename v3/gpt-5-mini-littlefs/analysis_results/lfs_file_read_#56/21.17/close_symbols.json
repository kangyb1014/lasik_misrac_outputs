  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about string.h functions producing out-of-bounds accesses you must inspect any code that actually copies/moves memory or computes sizes/offsets reachable from lfs_file_read_. The target function itself simply forwards to other functions, so the following symbols are required:\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: Direct callee that performs the actual read into the user-supplied buffer. Must be inspected for any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* and for correct size/offset calculations against the 'size' parameter.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called conditionally by the target; it can call other functions that move or copy data (including flushedread/flushedwrite). Its implementation must be checked for memcpy/memmove use and for correct bounds when interacting with file buffers.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Related writer routine that file_flush may call; it may perform memory copies from user buffers into internal caches \u2014 check for size misuse that could affect flush/read interactions.\n\n- lfs_bd_read and lfs_bd_flush: Block-device read/write primitives that move data between internal caches and caller buffers. These are likely places where memcpy/memmove are used; verify they don't copy beyond the provided buffer/size.\n\n- lfs_file_relocate: May move file contents (internally copying data); must be checked for memory-copy operations and correct ranges.\n\n- lfs_cache_drop: Manages cache buffers; may perform buffer copies or expose cached buffers to bd_read/write \u2014 inspect for any mem* usage and bounds handling.\n\n- lfs_dir_getread: Directory metadata read helper called by flushedread; may copy directory entry bytes into buffers \u2014 inspect for safe use of memcpy/memmove/str* and correct length checks.\n\n- lfs_ctz_find: Computes offsets/lengths (count trailing zeros/find free bits) that are used to compute copy sizes. Any miscalculation here can cause out-of-bounds copies, so include it.\n\n- lfs_min and lfs_max: Size-clamping macros/functions used to bound copy sizes. Their semantics (macro vs function) and usage affect whether copies are correctly limited; include to verify size computations.\n\n- lfs_file_t and lfs_t (and their relevant fields): Type definitions (file->pos, file->size, flags, and lfs->cfg and cache pointers) are required to reason about valid ranges, buffer ownership, and how sizes/offsets passed to mem* calls are derived.\n\n- lfs_size_t and lfs_ssize_t, lfs_block_t, lfs_off_t: Type definitions used for sizes/offsets to verify signed/unsigned conversions and to check whether size parameters passed to mem* calls match the buffers' actual lengths.\n\n- LFS_O_RDONLY and LFS_F_WRITING: Flag macros used to determine control flow (whether flush is called); needed to determine which call paths are possible.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertions may affect assumptions about sizes/offsets; include to know which invariants the code relies on.\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration fields such as read_size, prog_size, block_size, cache sizes): These configuration values determine granularity/alignment and maximum copy sizes performed by lower-level functions; they are essential to verify that copies do not exceed buffer bounds.\n\nIn short: include the direct callees that perform reads/writes and all helper functions, types, macros, and configuration fields that contribute to computing copy sizes and buffer addresses so that every place that might call standard string/memory functions can be inspected for out-of-bounds behavior."
