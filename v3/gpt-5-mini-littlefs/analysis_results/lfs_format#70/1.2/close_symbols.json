  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for compiler language extensions:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked at the start. Its definition must be inspected because it could hide compiler-specific extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, inline assembly, typeof, or compiler-specific attributes) that would violate the rule.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it is a macro/function used here and may use compiler extensions internally.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is variadic and uses format arguments and casts in the call site. Its expansion may use compiler extensions (variadic macro extensions like the GCC-specific ##__VA_ARGS__, non-standard format handling, or implementation-specific casts). Inspecting its definition is necessary to determine if an extension is used.\n\n- lfs_format_: Although called by lfs_format, its body is not required to decide whether lfs_format itself uses extensions. However, lfs_format simply forwards to lfs_format_; if lfs_format_ is implemented as a macro or inlined with extensions, that could be relevant. Include it to ensure no hidden extension in the immediate callee affects the apparent behavior.\n\n- struct lfs_config: The code reads many members of cfg (context, read, prog, erase, sync, read_size, prog_size, block_size, block_count, block_cycles, cache_size, lookahead_size, read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer, name_max, file_max, attr_max). The exact types (especially for the function-pointer members) must be known to determine whether the casts performed in the trace call (e.g. (void*)(uintptr_t)cfg->read) are standard-conforming or require non\u2011standard behavior.\n\n- lfs_t: The type of the first parameter; its definition is needed only to check for any odd/nonstandard attribute on the type that might be a compiler extension (e.g. special attributes, packed/unaligned qualifiers) although that is less likely \u2014 include for completeness.\n\n- read/prog/erase/sync (function-pointer types in struct lfs_config): The code casts these members (apparently function pointers) via (uintptr_t) and then to (void*). Converting function pointers to integer types or to data pointers may be implementation-defined or require extensions on some compilers. Knowing the exact declarations of these members is required to judge whether the casts are using non\u2011standard/implementation specific behavior.\n\n- uintptr_t: The code uses (uintptr_t) in casts. Inspect the typedef/availability in the target environment (stdint.h/stddef) to ensure uintptr_t is a standard integer type here and not a compiler-provided extension. Also conversion semantics between function pointers and integer types depend on the exact definition.\n\n- PRIu32 and PRId32: These format macros are used in the format string. Verify they are the standard inttypes.h macros and that their usage matches the underlying types (e.g. that read_size etc. are uint32_t/int32_t). Also check that any custom redefinitions of these macros are not compiler-specific extensions.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the target function uses language extensions you must inspect the definitions/decls of the logging and lock macros, the struct lfs_config (especially function-pointer member types), the presence and definition of uintptr_t and the PRI* macros, and the immediate callee lfs_format_. Any of these could hide compiler-specific extensions (casts, attributes, inline assembly, statement expressions, nonstandard variadic macro behavior, or pointer/integer conversion extensions)."
