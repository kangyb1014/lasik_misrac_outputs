Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - LFS_LOCK is invoked at the start of lfs_format and its expansion or implementation may contain control structures (if/while/for/do-while). To decide whether any controlling expression in the target function is invariant we must inspect the LFS_LOCK macro/function body. In particular, many lock macros expand to do { ... } while(0) or to loops; the do-while(0) pattern is a permitted MISRA exception only if the controlling expression is an integer constant false, so the exact macro definition is required.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - Analogous to LFS_LOCK: its definition may contain control statements or macro wrappers (again often do { ... } while(0)). We must inspect it to ensure it does not introduce an invariant controlling expression into the target function.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  - LFS_TRACE is a logging macro used in lfs_format. Logging macros commonly expand into compound statements or do/while(0) constructs; we need the precise macro expansion to verify whether any controlling expression in that expansion is invariant (and if it is a do-while(0), whether it meets the MISRA exception constraints).\n\n- lfs_format_\n  - Although the call to lfs_format_ in lfs_format is not itself a controlling expression, the callee's code may be inlined by the compiler (or the code base may use macros) or the callee's semantics may affect whether the overall function contains invariant control expressions after macro expansion. Including lfs_format_ allows the analyzer to see whether any control statements introduced by that function (or by macros it uses) are present in the translation unit that should be considered when judging lfs_format for MISRA Rule violations.\n\n- struct lfs_config\n  - lfs_format reads many members of cfg in the LFS_TRACE call (cfg->read_size, prog_size, etc.). The definitions of these members and any accessor macros are required in case any of them are implemented as macros/functions that expand to control-flow constructs. Also the struct definition helps resolve whether any expressions involving cfg members used in macros are constant/invariant.\n\n- lfs_t\n  - The type of the first parameter; include its definition because macros or inline functions that operate on lfs_t (or its fields) might contain controlling expressions. This ensures the analyzer can expand any inline accessor or lock/unlock implementations that reference lfs_t.\n\nNote: Standard format macros (PRIu32/PRId32) and the formatting arguments themselves are not expected to introduce control flow; the primary potential sources of invariant controlling expressions in this function are the macros (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE) and any macros/inline code reached via the direct callee (lfs_format_). Inspecting the listed symbols will allow a complete assessment of whether any controlling expressions visible from lfs_format are invariant."
