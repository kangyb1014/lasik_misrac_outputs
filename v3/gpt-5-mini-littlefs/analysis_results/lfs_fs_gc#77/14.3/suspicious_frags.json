  ],
  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not contain controlling expressions that are obviously invariant and therefore need not be investigated: the call and assignment err = lfs_fs_gc_(lfs); is a normal non-constant evaluation; the LFS_TRACE invocations are logging calls (not control-flow); LFS_UNLOCK is defined as ((void)cfg) and is not used as a controlling expression; the final return err; and other statements have no controlling expressions. The only controlling expression in the function is the if (err) above, and the LFS_LOCK macro that produces a constant should be examined. No other code fragments in the provided snippets present invariant controlling expressions per Rule 14.3."
