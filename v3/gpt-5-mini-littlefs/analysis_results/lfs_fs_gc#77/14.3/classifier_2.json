  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The code initializes err with LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), and LFS_LOCK is defined as ((void)cfg,0) which yields a constant 0 but is not a controlling expression. However, a violation would occur if that macro were used as a controlling expression, e.g. if (LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)) { ... } or while (LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)) { ... } \u2014 those would be invariant (always false/always true) and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
