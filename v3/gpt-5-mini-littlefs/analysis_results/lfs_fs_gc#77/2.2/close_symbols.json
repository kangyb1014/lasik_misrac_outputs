  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to assess dead-code for lfs_fs_gc:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - Determines whether the early return (err) can occur and has potential side-effects (blocking, state change). Removing the LFS_LOCK invocation could change timing/behavior or error-handling, so its definition and semantics are needed.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - Unlock side-effect and ordering relative to lfs_fs_gc_ matter: removing the function or the unlock could change system state or timing. Need its semantics to judge whether the unlock call is removable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  - Logging macro/function can have side-effects (I/O, formatting, asserts) or be a no-op. To decide if the trace calls are dead (removable) we must know its implementation and whether its removal affects behaviour or timing.\n\n- lfs_fs_gc_\n  - The core work is delegated to this function. To determine whether lfs_fs_gc as a wrapper is dead, we must inspect lfs_fs_gc_ to see if it performs observable effects; if it does, the wrapper is not dead even if no callers are visible.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan\n  - These are direct callees of lfs_fs_gc_. They may perform I/O, commits, allocation, or state changes that are observable. Understanding their side-effects is required to judge whether removing lfs_fs_gc_ (and therefore lfs_fs_gc) would change program behaviour.\n\n- lfs_t (type) and its cfg field/type\n  - The lock/unlock and possibly other operations act on lfs->cfg. The concrete type and semantics of cfg (e.g., lock object, pointer to OS primitives or driver state) determine whether the lock/unlock/other accesses are observable and thus whether those operations are removable.\n\nNote: to fully decide MISRA dead-code violation you may also need the global call graph (all callers, indirect uses such as function-pointer tables, registration APIs) and the concrete implementations of the above symbols, but the list above is the minimal set of additional symbols required to judge whether the function and its internal operations are removable without behavioural effect."
