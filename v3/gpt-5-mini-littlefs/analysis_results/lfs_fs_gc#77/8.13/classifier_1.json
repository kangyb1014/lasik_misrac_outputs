  "scenario": "From this single call site (LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)) there is no evidence that Rule 8.13 is violated. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (the pointee qualification), which are not shown here. If, however, lfs->cfg is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. lfs_config_t *cfg;) and LFS_LOCK (and all other users) do not modify the pointed-to object, then the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const lfs_config_t *cfg;) and that would be a violation of Rule 8.13 in the current code. Without the declaration of lfs->cfg or the definition/signature of LFS_LOCK, the fragment alone does not prove a violation."
