  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be const-qualified. The only constructs in this function that involve pointer types or pointer arguments are the ones listed above (function parameter, calls that pass lfs or lfs->cfg, and the cast to (void*) for tracing). Other lines in the function are integer declarations/returns or trace output of an integer (err) and do not involve pointer types, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need further investigation here."
