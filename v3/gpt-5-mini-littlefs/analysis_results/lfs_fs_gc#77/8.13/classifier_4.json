  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment passes lfs->cfg to LFS_UNLOCK. Lock/unlock operations typically modify the lock state or call non-const APIs on the configuration object, so the pointer must be to a modifiable (non-const) type. From this single call there is no evidence that lfs->cfg could be const-qualified, so Rule 8.13 is not violated here."
