  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with lfs->cfg. Macros can expand to code that assigns to identifiers or use/modify the function parameter variable; its expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not assign to the local parameter variable 'lfs' (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion could contain code that assigns to the parameter variable; inspect its definition/implementation.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro/function is passed the parameter (and its value). Some TRACE macros expand to complex code (do/while, temporary assignments, or wrappers) that could, in pathological cases, modify the parameter variable; include its definition to confirm it does not reassign 'lfs'.\n- lfs_fs_gc_: Although a normal function called with lfs cannot reassign the caller's local parameter, it could be a macro or inline implementation that might. Include its definition/implementation to verify it is a true function call (no macro redefinition) and that no code in its body (or macro expansion) reassigns the caller's parameter identifier.\n- lfs_t: The typedef/struct for lfs_t (and its cfg member) is needed to understand how the parameter is used in the macros (e.g., lfs->cfg) and to confirm there are no unusual macros/overloaded names that could make using lfs->... expand into an assignment to the parameter itself."
