  "explanation": "For MISRA C checks about out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by string.h routines you must inspect any code that the target calls (directly and indirectly) and any macros that run inside the target: \n\n- lfs_fs_gc_: called directly by lfs_fs_gc; its body may call string functions or pass buffers/sizes leading to violations. \n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: these are the callees of lfs_fs_gc_ per the call graph; each must be examined for use of string.h functions and for the sizes/limits of the buffers they manipulate. \n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: macros/functions invoked by lfs_fs_gc for locking; their implementations may use string/formatting functions or manipulate buffers (e.g. for diagnostics) and must be checked. \n- LFS_TRACE: logging/trace macro used in lfs_fs_gc; logging usually formats strings and can call snprintf/strncpy/etc. Its implementation must be checked for safe usage. \n- lfs_t: the target's primary type; its definition is needed to locate member types and buffer sizes used or passed to callees. \n- lfs->cfg (configuration object / its type definition, e.g. lfs_config): lock/trace macros take lfs->cfg; its fields (buffer sizes, pointers, callbacks) affect whether string functions are called and with what sizes. \n- data structure definitions used by callees (e.g. lfs_pair, lfs_dir, lfs_block_t): to determine the actual storage sizes and bounds of objects passed to string.h functions inside callees. \n- string.h functions potentially used by the above (memcpy, memmove, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, memcmp, strspn): to verify their call sites in the code above and ensure length/size arguments and buffers are correctly bounded.\n\nCollecting the source/definitions of these symbols allows a reviewer to trace all uses of standard string routines, inspect buffer sizes and length arguments, and determine whether any call can access beyond an object's bounds."
