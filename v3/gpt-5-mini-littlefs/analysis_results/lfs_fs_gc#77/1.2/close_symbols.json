  "explanation": "You must inspect the textual definitions of these symbols to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions: \n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function): The target calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it may use GCC/clang extensions (statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, __extension__, inline assembly, builtin functions, etc.). If it is an inline function it may carry compiler-specific attributes. Inspecting its definition shows whether an extension is used. \n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function): Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock is invoked in the target and its implementation may hide extensions. \n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): This logging macro is used twice with variadic arguments and casts. Macros that implement tracing commonly use variadic-macro extensions, GNU statement-expressions, or compiler attributes. You need its definition to verify whether it uses any non-standard language extensions. \n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including the cfg field): The code accesses lfs->cfg; the type of lfs_t and of its cfg member may be defined using compiler extensions (e.g., anonymous structs/unions in non-C11 modes, unnamed bit-fields, packed/aligned attributes, typeof-based fields, or compiler-specific specifiers). Inspecting the type definition is necessary to see if the code relies on extensions. \n\n- lfs_fs_gc_ (function definition/prototype): The target calls lfs_fs_gc_. The callee might be defined as static inline in a header or use attributes/extension features in its declaration (e.g., __attribute__((...)), __inline__ extents, or GCC-specific calling conventions). Its definition/prototype must be checked to ensure the call site or linkage uses no language extensions. \n\n(You only need these symbols to decide whether the target function itself depends on compiler extensions; other transitive callees can be skipped unless the above definitions reference further macros/types that use extensions.)"
