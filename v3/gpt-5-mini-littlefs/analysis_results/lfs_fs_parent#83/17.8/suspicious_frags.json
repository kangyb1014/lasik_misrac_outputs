  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying function parameters themselves (the pointer variables), though the objects they point to may be modified. The only places in this function that involve the parameters lfs, pair, or parent are the listed fragments: two direct writes through the parent pointer (parent->tail[...] = ...), a call that passes parent to another function, and the call that passes parent and parent->tail (and reads pair elements). All other code in the function is local initialization, constant/macro usage, condition checks, or returns (struct tortoise initialization, err handling, while loop and return statements), and does not assign to the parameter variables themselves nor otherwise modify them. Therefore those other lines do not need investigation under Rule 17.8."
