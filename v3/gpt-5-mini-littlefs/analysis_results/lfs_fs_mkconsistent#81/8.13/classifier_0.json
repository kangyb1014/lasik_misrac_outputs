  "scenario": "The pointer lfs is a function parameter of type lfs_t * and is used for an address-print in LFS_TRACE by casting to (void*). The object is not const-qualified because the function may modify the filesystem state elsewhere, so qualifying it const is not appropriate. Casting to void* for printing does not contradict the intent of Rule 8.13. Therefore there is no violation."
