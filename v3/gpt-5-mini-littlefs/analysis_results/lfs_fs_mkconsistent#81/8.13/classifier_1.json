  "scenario": "There is insufficient information in the fragment to prove a violation. Rule 8.13 concerns declarations of pointer types: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not intended to be modified. In this fragment we only see a call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); we do not see the declaration of the member cfg nor the signature/behavior of LFS_LOCK. If cfg is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. struct lfs_config *cfg) but LFS_LOCK (and all other users) do not modify the pointed-to object, then this is a violation: cfg should be declared as a pointer to const (e.g. const struct lfs_config *cfg). If, however, LFS_LOCK or other code legitimately modifies the pointed-to object, then a non-const pointer is appropriate and there is no violation."
