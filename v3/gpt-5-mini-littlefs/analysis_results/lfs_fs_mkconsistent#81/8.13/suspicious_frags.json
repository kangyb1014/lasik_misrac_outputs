  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve pointer parameters or pointer expressions were selected because MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns const-qualification of pointed-to types. Other lines in the function (variable declaration of err, return statements, trace format strings, and non-pointer operations) do not present potential violations of Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need investigation in this snippet. Deeper decisions about const-qualification require the declarations of the involved types (e.g. lfs_t and the type of cfg) and the implementations of the called macros/functions; those declarations are outside this fragment and were not included here."
