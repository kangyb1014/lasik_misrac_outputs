  "explanation": "To determine whether pointers in lfs_fs_mkconsistent can/should be const-qualified we must know whether the function (or anything it calls) mutates the object(s) pointed to or requires non-const pointers. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_t (definition of the structure): needed to check the type of the parameter lfs and whether its members are modified here or elsewhere; also to see if the API expects lfs_t to be mutable.\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg/configuration type used by lfs_t): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; we must know its type to see if it could be a pointer-to-const or requires mutability.\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (prototype/definition): the target forwards lfs to this function. If lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ modifies lfs or its internals, lfs cannot be const in the caller. We need the prototype/signature and implementation to see whether it accepts a const pointer or writes through it.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function prototypes): they are called with lfs->cfg. Their parameter types determine whether cfg must be mutable (non-const) and thus whether the pointer to cfg can be const-qualified.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function prototype): used with (void*)lfs and with formatting; the definition shows whether it requires a non-const pointer or mutates/logging state that forces non-const.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit (prototypes/definitions): these are callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_. Any of them may write through the lfs pointer or through members (e.g., dir_commit likely modifies filesystem state). Their signatures and bodies reveal whether they require non-const pointers and thus prevent adding const to lfs or its members.\n\nCollecting these symbols (types, prototypes, and implementations) lets the next analyser decide whether any pointer parameters in lfs_fs_mkconsistent can be const-qualified without breaking the program or violating intended mutation semantics."
