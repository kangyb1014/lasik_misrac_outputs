  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No definite violation can be determined from this single call. Most likely LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) needs a mutable pointer because unlocking modifies the object/state referenced by cfg (so the pointer should not be const) \u2014 in that common case Rule 8.13 is not violated (is_rule_violated = false). A concrete violation would occur only if the implementation of LFS_UNLOCK (and the underlying functions/macros it expands to) does not modify *cfg but its prototype/usage takes a non-const pointer; in that case lfs->cfg ought to be a pointer to a const-qualified type and passing a non-const pointer would violate Rule 8.13."
