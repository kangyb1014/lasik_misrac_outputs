  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The parameter lfs_t *lfs is used to lock/unlock and passed to lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(), which presumably modify filesystem state (via LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and the internal helper). Therefore the pointer must be non-const and the declaration does not violate Rule 8.13. (If, contrarily, the function only read from *lfs and did not modify any reachable object, then omitting const would be a violation.)"
