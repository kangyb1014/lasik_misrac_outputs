  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is the pointer 'lfs', and within this function it is never assigned to, incremented, or otherwise modified. Uses of the parameter are limited to: reading a member (lfs->cfg) for the LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros, passing the pointer to lfs_fs_mkconsistent_, and casting it to (void*) for tracing. None of these operations modify the parameter itself. Note: modifying the object pointed to by 'lfs' (e.g. via lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ or through the macros) would be allowed by Rule 17.8; the rule only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself, which does not occur in this code fragment. Therefore no further fragments in this function require investigation for Rule 17.8."
