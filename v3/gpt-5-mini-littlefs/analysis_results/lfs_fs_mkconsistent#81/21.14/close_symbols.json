  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_fs_mkconsistent (including work it delegates) violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings, we must inspect lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (the direct callee) and the functions it calls, because any of them may call memcmp incorrectly. Specifically:\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: the target function delegates the main work here; it may directly call memcmp or pass strings/char buffers to callees.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit: these are the callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_; memcmp misuse may occur inside any of them (including indirect comparisons of strings or buffers they receive).\n- memcmp: include the standard function symbol so the analyzer can detect direct calls (and any wrappers/aliases) and then examine the call sites/arguments to determine whether the arguments are null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the rule) or raw buffers (which is allowed).\n\nInspecting the source of these symbols (call sites and argument types/usage) is sufficient to determine if memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in the context of lfs_fs_mkconsistent."
