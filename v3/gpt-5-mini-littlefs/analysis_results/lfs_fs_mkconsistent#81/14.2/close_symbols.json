Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_mkconsistent violates the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect any for loops that occur in the function body and in any functions called from that body (MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body). The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: This is the direct callee of the target function. Its implementation must be inspected for any for statements and to see whether it calls other functions containing for loops or modifies objects that could be used as loop counters/flags in enclosing loops.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit: These are the callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_. Any for loops (or side effects on objects used as loop counters/flags) inside these functions, or objects they modify, are relevant because their behaviour contributes to the containing function\u2019s semantics with respect to the MISRA rule.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE (macro/inline definitions): These macros are invoked in lfs_fs_mkconsistent. Macros can expand to code containing for loops or expressions with side effects; you must see their expansions to ensure they do not violate the three clauses (e.g., by modifying loop counters or other objects used in for clauses).\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): Knowing the structure of lfs_t is necessary to find what members (especially lfs->cfg) refer to and to understand whether any members are used as loop counters or modified by called functions.\n\n- definition/type of lfs->cfg (configuration object): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK operate on lfs->cfg. The lock/unlock implementations might access or modify fields that could be used in for loops (directly or indirectly) or have persistent side effects; their types and semantics must be known to reason about forbidden side effects in the second (condition) or third (iteration) clauses or modifications in the loop body.\n\nNote: If any of the listed functions in turn call further functions, the implementations of those deeper callees should also be included recursively until all functions reachable from lfs_fs_mkconsistent (that could participate in or affect for\u2011loop behaviour) have been examined. The provided list is the minimal immediate closure needed from the static call graph shown."
