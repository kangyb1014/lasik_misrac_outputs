  "explanation": "The visible C constructs in this function (function signature, local variable declaration, assignments, return statements, pointer cast (void*) for %p, and format strings) are standard C and do not themselves indicate use of compiler language extensions. However, the macro invocations (LFS_LOCK, LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK) are flagged because macros can expand to compiler-specific extensions (for example GNU statement expressions, typeof, asm, __attribute__ uses, or other non-standard builtins) which are explicitly classified as extensions in compiler documentation. Those macro invocations should be investigated by inspecting their definitions. No other fragments in this function show any explicit compiler extension syntax (no __attribute__, asm, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expression ({ ... }), or other recognized extension tokens), so they do not need further investigation here."
