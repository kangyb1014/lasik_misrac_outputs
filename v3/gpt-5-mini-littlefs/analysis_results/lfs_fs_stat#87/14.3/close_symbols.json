A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The controlling expression if (err) uses the value returned by LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To decide whether that controlling expression is invariant you must inspect the full definition/expansion of LFS_LOCK to see if it always yields a compile-time constant or if it depends on runtime state.\n- lfs_t (structure definition, including the cfg member): LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg. You need the lfs_t definition to determine the type and mutability of cfg (whether it can vary at run time or could be a compile-time constant or constant-expression).\n- definition/type of the cfg member (the type passed as lfs->cfg): The semantics of LFS_LOCK may depend on the cfg type (for example, it may read fields or pointers inside cfg). Examining the cfg type lets you determine whether the argument to LFS_LOCK can vary between calls.\n- all symbols referenced inside the LFS_LOCK implementation (underlying lock functions/macros/constants): If LFS_LOCK is a macro or wrapper, its expansion may call lower-level functions or use constants (e.g. a no-op that expands to 0). Those helper symbols must be inspected to establish whether LFS_LOCK's return value is invariant."
