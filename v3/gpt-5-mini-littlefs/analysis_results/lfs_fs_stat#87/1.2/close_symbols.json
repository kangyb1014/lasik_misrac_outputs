  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros or inline helpers invoked by the function. Their expansions must be inspected to see whether they use compiler-specific extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, __builtin_... etc.). If they are functions, their declarations could also carry extension attributes.\\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro/function is invoked with a format string and casted pointers; trace macros commonly employ variadic macro tricks, format attributes, or compiler-specific helpers. You must inspect its definition/expansion for any compiler-specific extensions (variadic macro extensions, ##__VA_ARGS__ pre-C99 behavior, __attribute__(format), __builtin_expect, etc.).\\n- lfs_t (full definition): The target dereferences lfs->cfg. The actual type definition of lfs_t (and any embedded anonymous unions/structs, bitfields, or other nonstandard constructs) must be checked because anonymous members or compiler-specific layout pragmas could be language extensions.\\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg (cfg field): The expression LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) passes lfs->cfg to the lock helper; the exact type/definition of cfg may reveal use of compiler extensions (e.g., typeof-based macros, nonstandard attributes on the type).\\n- struct lfs_fsinfo (declaration): The function takes a pointer to this struct; its definition should be checked for anonymous unions/structs, bitfields with implementation-defined widths or other compiler extensions.\\n- lfs_fs_stat_ (declaration/definition): Although this is a callee, its prototype/definition may include compiler-specific attributes (e.g., __attribute__ annotations, inline asm in the declaration) or use extensions that affect how the call is compiled. Inspecting it ensures no extension is pulled into the translation unit that would make the target function rely on a language extension.\n\nOnly these symbols are necessary to determine whether the target function (as written and via its direct macro expansions and used types/declarations) relies on compiler language extensions. Inspect their header/definition locations (macro expansions and type/decl definitions) for any usage of documented compiler extensions such as __attribute__, asm, typeof, statement-expressions, __builtin_*, or vendor-specific keywords."
