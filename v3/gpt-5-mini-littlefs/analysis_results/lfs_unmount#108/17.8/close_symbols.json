  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is used in the function as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to the parameter identifier \"lfs\" (or otherwise modifies the parameter variable). Need the definition to rule out any assignment to the parameter itself. If it is a function, its prototype/definition confirms it cannot change the caller's local parameter variable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK (used as LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg)). Its definition determines whether it might expand to assignment to the parameter name.\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace/log macros often expand inline; if LFS_TRACE is a macro it could contain code that modifies the parameter identifier. Need its definition to ensure it does not assign to or rebind the parameter.\n- lfs_unmount_: The callsite passes the parameter value to lfs_unmount_. If lfs_unmount_ were actually implemented as a macro (or inline expansion) it could contain assignments to the identifier \"lfs\" in the caller; if it is a plain function it cannot change the caller's parameter variable. Include its definition to disambiguate.\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition including member cfg): Confirm the true declaration of the parameter type and the member name \"cfg\" so we can check whether member access is ordinary or if the member name is subject to macro substitution that could change tokenization/expansion behavior.\n- cfg (any macro definition for the member name): If there is a macro named cfg (or other macros that substitute tokens used in the expression lfs->cfg), macro expansion could produce unexpected code that modifies the parameter variable. Include any such macro definitions.\n\nThese symbols are the only additional items needed to determine whether the function body (including expanded macros/calls) performs an assignment or other modification of the parameter identifier 'lfs'."
