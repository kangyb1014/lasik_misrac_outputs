  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies the parameter variable 'lfs' itself. Specific notes:\n- The calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) pass the member expression lfs->cfg to macros that expand to ((void)cfg,0) and ((void)cfg) respectively; these macros do not modify the pointer parameter.\n- LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount(%p)\", (void*)lfs) merely casts and uses the pointer for tracing; it does not assign to or modify 'lfs'.\n- The call err = lfs_unmount_(lfs) passes the pointer to another function; passing a pointer is allowed and does not modify the caller's parameter variable. The definition of lfs_unmount_ simply returns lfs_deinit(lfs) and does not assign to its own parameter either.\n- Any modification of the object pointed to by 'lfs' (e.g., within lfs_deinit) would be permitted by Rule 17.8; the rule forbids modifying the parameter variable itself, and no assignment/alteration of the pointer parameter appears in the provided code.\nTherefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the supplied code."
