  "explanation": "I scanned the provided code for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any comparisons of null-terminated strings. No calls to memcmp (or to strcmp/strcoll) appear in lfs_unmount, lfs_unmount_, lfs_deinit, or in the shown type definitions. The functions present perform locking/unlocking, tracing, deinitialization and conditional frees based on pointer checks; they do not perform string comparisons or call memcmp. The buffers shown are uint8_t* (binary buffers), not char* strings, and there are no string literals or code that treats these buffers as null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. (If other source files or macros such as LFS_TRACE/LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK exist, those should be scanned separately; they are not shown here.)"
