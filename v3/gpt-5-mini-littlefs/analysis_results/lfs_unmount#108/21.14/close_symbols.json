  "explanation": "- lfs_unmount_: This is the direct callee from lfs_unmount and may itself contain calls to memcmp or call other functions that do. You must inspect its body to find any memcmp usage and the arguments passed.\n- lfs_deinit: Shown in the static call graph as a callee of lfs_unmount_. Any memcmp use in lfs_deinit (or calls it makes) could be a MISRA violation reachable from lfs_unmount, so its implementation is required.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is about usage of this standard-library function. You need the memcmp symbol (prototype/usages) to identify call sites and then inspect the arguments to determine whether they are null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_t: The type/structure definition for lfs_t (and any related config/field types accessed by lfs_unmount_, lfs_unmount_ and lfs_deinit) is needed to interpret the arguments passed to memcmp (pointer types, buffers, lengths) and decide whether those buffers are null-terminated strings.\n\nNote: to be thorough you should also include the full source of any additional transitive callees discovered inside lfs_unmount_ or lfs_deinit, since memcmp calls might appear deeper in the call chain; the three function symbols above are the immediate symbols required to start that analysis."
