  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the code simply calls LFS_TRACE with a format string and a (void*) pointer. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 targets use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, etc.) that can access beyond object bounds; the fragment does not call any of those functions. (However, a violation could occur if the LFS_TRACE implementation used a <string.h> function unsafely \u2014 e.g. copying the formatted message into a too-small buffer with strcpy/memcpy: char buf[8]; strcpy(buf, \"lfs_unmount(%p)\"); \u2014 which would violate Rule 21.17.)"
