  "explanation": "lfs_unmount_: The target directly calls this function; any use of memcpy/memset/strncpy/etc. that could access out-of-bounds memory may be inside it. You must inspect its body and parameter usage to determine compliance.\nlfs_deinit: Listed as a callee of lfs_unmount_. It may perform string.h operations on buffers/fields originating from lfs, so its implementation is needed to follow the call chain for possible unsafe string operations.\nlfs_t (definition): The layout and sizes of members of lfs_t are required to judge whether any pointer/length arguments passed to string.h functions in callees can exceed object bounds (for example buffers embedded in the filesystem state).\ndefinition of the type of lfs->cfg (configuration struct/typedef): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and may be used by callees. Knowing the cfg type and its buffer/size fields is necessary to verify that any string.h calls that use cfg pointers/lengths are in-bounds.\nLFS_LOCK (macro/function) and LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function): These may be macros or functions that expand to code that touches cfg or other buffers or that wrap calls which use string.h functions. Their definitions are needed to ensure they themselves do not introduce out-of-bounds string.h usage or alter objects passed to subsequent calls.\nLFS_TRACE (macro/function): Trace/logging macros sometimes format strings or copy buffers. Although typically not in <string.h>, the macro may expand to code that uses string functions or that manipulates buffers from lfs; include it to rule out any string.h misuse introduced by tracing.\n\nInclude the bodies/signatures/typedefs for these symbols so the analyzer can inspect all possible uses of memcpy/memset/memcpy/strncpy/etc. and verify that pointer/length arguments do not permit out-of-bounds accesses."
