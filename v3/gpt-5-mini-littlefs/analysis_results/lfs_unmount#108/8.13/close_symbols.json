  "explanation": "Why each is needed to check the MISRA pointer-const rule:\n\n- lfs_t (struct/typedef): to know the exact type and member declarations (especially cv-qualification and whether members are pointers). Making the lfs parameter const or not depends on what members exist and how they are declared.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. lfs_cfg_t / struct lfs_config): lfs_unmount passes lfs->cfg to lock/unlock. You must know whether cfg is a pointer, whether it is declared const-qualified, or if making lfs const would change the effective type of cfg (top-level vs nested const) and whether that is compatible with callees.\n\n- lfs_unmount_ (declaration + definition): the body and prototype of the internal unmount routine determine whether the lfs object (or its members) are modified. If lfs_unmount_ mutates lfs, the public lfs_unmount parameter cannot be const.\n\n- lfs_deinit (declaration + definition): lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit (per the call graph). lfs_deinit may modify the lfs object or its members; its prototype/body are required to decide whether const qualification is permissible.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function signature): lfs_unmount calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If the lock API requires a non-const cfg pointer or writes through the cfg pointer, that prevents declaring cfg (or the lfs pointer) as const-compatible.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function signature): same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock API parameter types and whether it modifies state affect whether cfg (and thus lfs) can be const.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function signature): lfs is passed (cast) to tracing. If the trace API expects a void* (non-const) then making lfs a pointer-to-const would require casting away const (or change the trace call). You must know the trace prototype to determine whether that cast/discard of const would violate MISRA rules.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to decide whether the lfs parameter (and its cfg member) can/should be const-qualified without introducing casts that discard const or breaking called APIs."
