  "scenario": "The lfs_unmount function takes a non-const pointer lfs_t *lfs, but the function body calls lfs_unmount_(lfs) and performs LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK on lfs->cfg, which imply modification or mutation of the object (or at least passing it to APIs that expect a modifiable lfs_t). Therefore the pointer cannot be const here. (If, contrary to the implementation, lfs_unmount only read from the object and never modified it or passed it to non-const APIs, then using a non-const pointer would violate Rule 8.13.)"
