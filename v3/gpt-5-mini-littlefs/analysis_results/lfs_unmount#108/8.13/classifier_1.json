  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. In this fragment lfs is of type lfs_t * (a mutable pointer) and is cast to void* only for printing with %p. The function clearly uses lfs to modify state (calls LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and lfs_unmount_), so the pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified here. A concrete violation scenario would be if lfs were declared as const lfs_t * but then cast to (void*) (removing the const qualifier) or if the pointer could be made const but was not; neither applies in the shown code."
