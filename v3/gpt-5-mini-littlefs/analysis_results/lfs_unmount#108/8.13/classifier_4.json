  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation based on the fragment: passing lfs->cfg to LFS_UNLOCK is not inherently a breach of Rule 8.13 because an unlock operation typically requires modifying lock state (so the pointer must be to a non-const object). Without the declarations of lfs_t::cfg and the LFS_UNLOCK macro/function we cannot prove a violation. A concrete violation scenario would be: lfs->cfg has type 'const struct lfs_config *' was possible (i.e. LFS_UNLOCK only performs read-only access), but it is declared as 'struct lfs_config *' and neither LFS_UNLOCK nor any callee actually modify the object \u2014 in that case the pointer could (and should) be const-qualified and Rule 8.13 would be violated."
