  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The first assignment to err is err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); to decide whether the controlling expression if (err) is invariant we must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition (macro or function). If LFS_LOCK expands to or always returns a compile-time constant (e.g. 0) or otherwise yields an invariant value, the if (err) would be an invariant controlling expression and could violate MISRA. Also need to know any side effects LFS_LOCK may have.\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition, including cfg member and its type): The argument passed to LFS_LOCK is lfs->cfg. We must know the type and semantics of cfg (and whether it could be a compile-time constant or otherwise make LFS_LOCK\u2019s result invariant). The struct definition is required to reason about possible invariance originating from the argument.\n- LFS_TRACE: Although tracing typically has no effect on control flow, LFS_TRACE may be a macro that expands to nothing or to code with side effects. Inspecting its definition ensures it does not alter err or introduce constant expressions that would affect the controlling expression analysis.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Included to check for macros/definitions that could affect locking/unlocking semantics or global constants used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_TRACE; while LFS_UNLOCK is not directly used in the controlling expression, its definition may share macros or conditional compilation that influence whether LFS_LOCK is invariant.\n- lfs_unmount_ (implementation/prototype): The function later assigns err = lfs_unmount_(lfs). While the immediate controlling expression (if (err)) tests the value set by LFS_LOCK before this call, the behavior and reuse of the same variable err later (and any shared macros/definitions used across these functions) should be reviewed. Also lfs_unmount_\u2019s implementation may reveal shared config/compile-time constants that indicate LFS_LOCK/LFS_TRACE are conditioned to constant behavior.  \n\nProvide these symbols so the next analyst can determine whether any controlling expression in lfs_unmount is effectively invariant (and whether any allowed exceptions apply)."
