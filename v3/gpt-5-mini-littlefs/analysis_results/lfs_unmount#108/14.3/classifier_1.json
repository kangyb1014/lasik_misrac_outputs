  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The variable 'err' is assigned from the macro LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) which expands to ((void)cfg,0), so err is always 0. The subsequent controlling expression 'if (err)' is therefore invariantly false. This is not one of the permitted exceptions (infinite loops or the special do-while integer-constant case), so Rule 14.3 is violated."
