  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. The only const-qualified pointer is 'const char *path' (correct). 'lfs' and 'file' are passed to operations that open/modify state (lock/unlock, open), so they must be non-const. The cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file does not remove const from a const-qualified object (file is non-const), so Rule 8.13 is not violated. (Note: as an improvement, the helper lfs_mlist_isopen could take const pointers to avoid the cast, but that is a change to the helper's signature rather than a rule violation here.)"
