  "explanation": "I found no assignments or modifications of the function parameters lfs, dir, or off within lfs_dir_seek. The function only: calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) (accessing a member of the object pointed to by lfs, which is permitted), calls LFS_TRACE with the parameters (casts only, no reassignment), calls lfs_dir_seek_(lfs, dir, off) (passing the parameters by value/pointer; any modification would be inside that callee, not this function), and returns a local err. There are no statements that reassign lfs, dir, or off (no =, ++, --, or compound assignment on those identifiers). Therefore there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
