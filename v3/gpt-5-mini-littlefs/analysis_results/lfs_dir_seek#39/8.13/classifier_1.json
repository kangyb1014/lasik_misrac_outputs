  "scenario": "The call itself does not indicate a violation. A violation would occur if the callee's prototype is: int lfs_dir_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir, lfs_off_t off) but the function does not modify the object pointed to by dir \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared as const lfs_dir_t *dir (and the call should pass a pointer-to-const as appropriate). If, however, lfs_dir_seek_ needs to modify *dir (or lfs), then the non-const pointer is appropriate and there is no violation."
