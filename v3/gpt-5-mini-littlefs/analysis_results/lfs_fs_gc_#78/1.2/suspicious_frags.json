  "explanation": "I did not find any constructs in the provided code that are clearly compiler-specific language extensions (such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, asm, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific extensions). The elements in the code are standard C features introduced in C99 or earlier and therefore are not extensions per typical compiler documentation: \n\n- Line comments (// ...) \u2014 standard since C99. \n- Designated initializer used in lfs_mdir_t mdir = {.tail = {0, 1}}; \u2014 standard C99 aggregate designator syntax. \n- static inline function (lfs_pair_isnull) \u2014 inline is a standard C99 feature; static inline is common and standard. \n- use of the bool type \u2014 standard via stdbool.h (C99). \n- Ternary operator (?:), conditional expressions, pointer and array usage, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef), and struct definitions/initializers \u2014 all standard C. \n\nIf your toolchain intentionally compiles in a strict pre-C99 (C90) mode, some of these constructs (// comments, inline, _Bool/bool, designated initializers) may be treated by that compiler as extensions. Rule 1.2 requires checking compiler documentation: if your specific compiler documents any of these features as extensions in the selected language mode, then those specific uses should be reported. Based on the code alone and common compiler documentation, there are no explicit compiler-language extensions to flag."
