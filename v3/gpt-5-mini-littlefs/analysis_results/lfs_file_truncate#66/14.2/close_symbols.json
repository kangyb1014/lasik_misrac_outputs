The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each requested symbol (concise):\n\nlfs_file_truncate_\n- Direct callee of the target. MISRA says the behaviour of called functions is part of the for-loop body, so any for-loops inside lfs_file_truncate_ (or uses of loop counters modified there) must be inspected.\n\nlfs_file_size_\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Its implementation may contain for-loops or modify objects used as loop counters in enclosing code paths; include to inspect loop clauses and side effects.\n\nlfs_file_seek_\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Must be checked for for-loops and for modifications of objects that could act as loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\nlfs_cache_drop\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Could contain loops or side effects relevant to MISRA requirements about loop counters and permitted side effects.\n\nlfs_file_flushedread\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Its internal loops (if any) or modifications to shared objects influence compliance because function behaviour counts toward the for-loop body.\n\nlfs_file_flush\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Inspect for any for-loops or modifications that would violate the clause restrictions.\n\nlfs_ctz_find\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Include because it may contain loops or modify objects used in loop control in the call chain.\n\nlfs_file_write_\n- Called by lfs_file_truncate_. Must be inspected for loops and side effects that could violate the three-clause restrictions (e.g., modifying loop counters or other objects used in loop conditions).\n\nlfs_mlist_isopen\n- Direct callee of the target (used in LFS_ASSERT). Its body must be checked for for-loops or side effects because it executes as part of the target function's behaviour.\n\nLFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_ASSERT, LFS_TRACE\n- These macros/functions are invoked in the target. Although typically simple, they can expand to code (including loops) or have side effects that affect loop compliance (e.g., modifying objects used as loop counters). Include their definitions to be certain they do not introduce loops or forbidden side effects.\n\nNotes:\n- The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the for-loop body, therefore all direct callees and their transitive callees that appear in the static call graph must be analyzed.\n- Only the bodies/definitions of the listed symbols are required to determine whether any for-loops exist and whether those loops conform to the three-clause restrictions (initialiser, condition side effects, increment modifications, single loop counter, and no modification of the loop counter in the body or in called functions)."
