  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule banning compiler language extensions we must inspect any macros, types, and called symbols that could hide extensions in their definitions/expansions. Short justification for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: a macro (or inline wrapper) used directly in the function; its expansion must be checked for GCC/clang extensions (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, nested functions, use of builtin intrinsics, non-standard keywords, or other compiler-specific constructs).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its definition may contain compiler-specific constructs and must be inspected.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function used with a format string and variadic arguments; macros implementing tracing often use variadic macros, token-pasting, or compiler builtins. Inspect its definition for use of variadic-macro extensions, format-string tricks, or other non-standard preprocessor/Compiler features.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro \u2014 may expand to constructs that are implementation-specific (e.g. do { ... } while(0) with GCC extensions, __builtin_unreachable, __attribute__, or uses of sizeof on expressions). Must be checked.\n\n- PRIu32: format macro (from <inttypes.h> or a project equivalent) used inside the string literal via token concatenation. Confirm it is the standard inttypes macro and not a project-defined macro that uses extensions.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called inside LFS_ASSERT; while likely a normal function, inspect its prototype/definition only to ensure there are no odd calling-convention attributes or non-standard parameter type annotations used that might affect the target function's compliance.\n\n- lfs_file_truncate_: the function invoked to do the truncation; its declaration/definition should be checked to ensure its prototype and any inline/attribute usage do not introduce language extensions (e.g. function attributes, naked/interrupt functions, inline asm, or GCC-only syntax).\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, lfs_off_t: the typedefs/types used in the function signature and in casts; check their definitions for use of compiler extensions (e.g. bit-field types with non-standard widths, typeof-based typedefs, anonymous structs/unions if the project disallows them, packed/aligned attributes, or compiler-specific storage-class specifiers).\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration object/type): the member passed into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; its type definition or the cfg type may include macros/attributes (alignment, packed, attributes) or use compiler-specific constructs. Inspect the cfg type and any macros related to it.\n\nThese symbols cover all macros, format-token macros, types, and callees directly used by lfs_file_truncate that could hide compiler-specific language extensions. Inspecting their definitions/expansions is necessary to determine whether the target function uses any language extensions."
