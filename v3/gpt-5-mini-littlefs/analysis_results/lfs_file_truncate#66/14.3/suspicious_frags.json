  "explanation": "Other control expressions in the provided code do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the for-loop in lfs_mlist_isopen (for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next)) has a non\u2011invariant condition (*p changes as p advances through the list). The LFS_ASSERT line expands to assert(...) (a diagnostic macro that evaluates a runtime condition and is not an invariant controlling expression in normal builds), and LFS_TRACE expands to nothing here, so it introduces no controlling expression. LFS_UNLOCK is a void-like macro and not used in a controlling expression. There are no other loops, switch statements, or conditional expressions in the snippet that are invariant and thus require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
