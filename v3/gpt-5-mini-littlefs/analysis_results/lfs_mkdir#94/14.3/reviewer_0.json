In lfs_mkdir this value is assigned to err and then used in the controlling expression if (err) which is therefore always false (an invariant controlling expression). This is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_mkdir:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the provided code LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is defined as ((void)cfg, 0), so err is assigned the constant value 0. The subsequent controlling expression if (err) is therefore an invariant (always false). MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions (the permitted exceptions do not apply here \u2014 the infinite-loop exception and the special do-while constant-false exception are not relevant to an if statement). Thus the scenario describes a legitimate violation. (If LFS_LOCK can be defined differently in other build configurations then the condition might not be invariant in those builds, but given the provided macro definition the reported violation stands.)"
