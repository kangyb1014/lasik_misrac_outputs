  "explanation": "You must determine whether the controlling expression if (err) is potentially invariant. For that you need the following symbols:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - Reason: The controlling expression reads err immediately from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must inspect the LFS_LOCK macro or function body to see whether it can return a constant (compile-time invariant) or whether it produces a runtime-varying value (e.g. checks or modifies state). If LFS_LOCK is a macro, its expansion may be an integer constant or an expression that is always true/false.\n\n- (underlying function called by LFS_LOCK, e.g. lfs_lock)\n  - Reason: If LFS_LOCK is a wrapper macro that calls an actual function (commonly named lfs_lock or similar), you must inspect that function implementation to know whether its return value depends on runtime state or is invariant.\n\n- lfs_t (definition of the structure)\n  - Reason: LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. You must know the type/layout of lfs_t to understand what lfs->cfg refers to, whether it is a constant/global, and whether reading its contents could affect LFS_LOCK's behavior.\n\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg (the configuration type)\n  - Reason: The dynamic behavior of LFS_LOCK may depend on fields inside the cfg object. To decide if the condition is invariant you need to know whether cfg is constant/immutable or contains mutable state used by LFS_LOCK.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  - Reason: Although LFS_TRACE is a logging macro, its expansion could contain expressions or side-effects (even conditionals) that alter program state or the value of err in some builds. Inspecting it ensures the logging calls do not make the controlling expression non-invariant or otherwise change control flow.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - Reason: Unlikely to affect the first if (err) test, but LFS_UNLOCK might be paired with LFS_LOCK via shared state; inspect it to ensure there are no unexpected compile-time expansions or side-effects that change the semantics used to judge invariance.\n\n(Notes: lfs_mkdir_ and other callees are not required to evaluate the invariance of the immediate controlling expression if (err) because that test reads err before the call to lfs_mkdir_. They only matter if you want to analyze other control expressions inside lfs_mkdir_.)"
