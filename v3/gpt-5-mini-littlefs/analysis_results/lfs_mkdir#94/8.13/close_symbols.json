  "explanation": "lfs_mkdir_: need the function prototype/definition to see the const-qualification of its parameters (especially whether it accepts lfs_t * or const lfs_t *, and whether it takes const char * for path). If lfs_mkdir_ requires non-const pointers then lfs_mkdir cannot make those parameters const.\n\nlfs_t: the complete struct/type is required to determine which members are mutated/read (in particular whether lfs itself could be const) and the exact type of the cfg member.\n\nlfs->cfg (cfg type / lfs_cfg_t): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; we must know the cfg type to see whether the lock APIs require a mutable pointer (non-const) or could accept a const-qualified pointer.\n\nLFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their macro/function definitions/prototypes determine whether they accept const pointers or perform modifications \u2014 this directly affects whether the cfg pointer (and by extension lfs) must be non-const.\n\nLFS_TRACE: its macro/function signature (or expansion) is needed to confirm it does not require a non-const pointer (it likely only reads/prints the pointer), so it cannot force removal of const qualification.
