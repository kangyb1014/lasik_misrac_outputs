  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) we must know which controlling expressions can actually change at runtime and which are compile-time constants. Brief rationale for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called at the start; may modify file->flags, file->pos, or other file state. Needed to determine whether the controlling expression involving F_READING (and later checks) can change because of the call.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Used in the zero-fill loop and the final write; likely advances file->pos and may change flags or error state. Required to show that while(file->pos < pos) and subsequent checks are not invariant (file->pos changes) and to check for possible non-termination or invariant behavior.\n\n- lfs_file_t: Definition of the file object (fields flags, pos, ctz, etc.) is required to see which fields are mutable and their types, so we can tell whether controlling expressions read mutable state.\n\n- lfs_ctz_t (or the concrete type/name of file->ctz): The ctz member has a .size field used in several conditions. We need its definition/type to reason about mutability and integer semantics of comparisons with file->pos.\n\n- lfs_t: Definition of the filesystem context (contains file_max and possibly other limits). Needed for interpreting file_max used in file->pos + size > lfs->file_max.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Macro expansion/definition is required to know whether the ASSERT produces a controlling expression at runtime, is compiled out, or otherwise affects control flow (and whether that condition can be invariant).\n\n- LFS_O_WRONLY, LFS_F_READING, LFS_O_APPEND, LFS_F_WRITING, LFS_F_ERRED: Flag macros/constants used in all conditional expressions and the final bit-clear. Their values (and whether any are aliases) are needed to decide if the bit-tests are on mutable data or on compile-time fixed values.\n\n- lfs_off_t, lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t: The integer typedefs used in arithmetic and comparisons determine signedness, ranges and wrap/overflow behavior (e.g. file->pos + size > lfs->file_max). Understanding these types is necessary to decide whether an expression could be invariant due to integer promotion/overflow or be changed at runtime.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether each controlling expression (the ASSERT, the if-tests, the while loop, and the error checks) depends on mutable state or only on compile-time invariants, and whether any loop/control might be an invariant (constant) expression in violation of MISRA."
