  "explanation": "Include each symbol because the MISRA rule concerns use of <string.h> functions (memcpy/memset/etc.) in the call chain and any sizing/pointer arithmetic that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: direct callee. Must inspect its implementation for any memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp uses and how 'buffer' and 'size' are passed/checked relative to file state.\n- lfs_file_flush: direct callee (earlier in function). May call routines that use string functions or change file state/positions that influence later writes.\n- lfs_file_flushedread: reachable from lfs_file_flush; could invoke memory functions or copy buffers impacting bounds.\n- lfs_cache_zero: likely implements zeroing (memset); need its size and pointer handling to ensure zeroing does not write out-of-bounds.\n- lfs_bd_prog: low-level block programming routine; may copy program buffers (memcpy) to device buffers \u2014 check parameters and lengths passed from higher-level code.\n- lfs_file_relocate: relocates file data/metadata; may use memcpy/memmove and affect offsets/sizes used by writes.\n- lfs_cache_drop: used by flush; may manipulate cache buffers and their sizes/pointers \u2014 could reveal uses of memory functions.\n- lfs_file_outline, lfs_ctz_find, lfs_ctz_extend, lfs_alloc_ckpoint: called (directly or indirectly) by flushedwrite; these manipulate container/extent metadata and can determine lengths/offsets used in memory operations \u2014 include to trace how sizes passed to memcpy/memset are computed.\n\nType and state symbols (structs, fields, typedefs, constants):\n- lfs_file_t, lfs_t, file->ctz and file->ctz.size, file->pos, lfs->file_max: these define the buffers/offsets and limits used by the target and its callees; needed to verify that any memory function arguments (lengths, dest/src pointers, computed offsets) are within object bounds.\n- LFS_O_WRONLY, LFS_F_READING, LFS_O_APPEND, LFS_F_WRITING, LFS_F_ERRED, LFS_ERR_FBIG: flags and error codes used by the target; flags affect control flow (e.g., filling with zeros, append behavior) which in turn affect what callees run and what sizes are computed.\n- typedefs lfs_off_t, lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: to interpret arithmetic and limits on sizes/offsets and detect possible integer-width/overflow problems that could lead to out-of-bounds memory operations.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any memcpy/memset/memmove/etc. in the transitive call graph can be invoked with pointers/lengths that exceed the referenced objects, you must inspect the implementations of the listed callees and the definitions of the file and filesystem state used to compute their arguments."
