  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_file_write_ violates the MISRA rule against recursive calls, we must inspect every function it calls (directly) and every function those callees can call (transitively) to see if any path leads back to lfs_file_write_ (directly or indirectly). The required symbols are:\n\n- lfs_file_flush: directly called by lfs_file_write_; must be examined for any calls that could eventually call back into lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: directly called by lfs_file_write_; must be examined for any transitive calls back to lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_cache_drop: callee of lfs_file_flush; could contain a path that leads back to lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_file_flushedread: callee of lfs_file_flush; inspect for any calls into functions that could reach lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_bd_flush: callee of lfs_file_flush; inspect for potential indirect recursion.\n- lfs_file_relocate: callee of both lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite; a likely candidate to contain further calls that might reach lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_max: callee of lfs_file_flush / lfs_file_flushedwrite (likely utility); include to be sure it does not invoke any path to lfs_file_write_.\n- lfs_file_outline: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_ctz_find: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_cache_zero: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_alloc_ckpoint: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_ctz_extend: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_min: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite (utility); include to be sure it does not call back.\n- lfs_bd_prog: callee of lfs_file_flushedwrite; include to check for recursive paths.\n- lfs_file_truncate_: although not called by lfs_file_write_ directly, it is known (from the static graph) to call lfs_file_write_; include it because a transitive path from a callee back to lfs_file_truncate_ would create a cycle (lfs_file_write_ -> ... -> lfs_file_truncate_ -> lfs_file_write_). \n\nIn short, include each direct callee and their transitive callees (as listed) plus lfs_file_truncate_ (a known caller of lfs_file_write_) so the next analyst can inspect implementations and confirm whether any call chain returns to lfs_file_write_, thus constituting forbidden recursion."
