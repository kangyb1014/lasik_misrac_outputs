  "explanation": "Only the explicit uses of string-handling functions from <string.h> in this snippet are flagged. The rest of the code (control flow: special offset checks, while loop, increments, returns) does not itself call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not directly raise Rule 21.17 concerns. The calls to lfs_dir_fetch and lfs_dir_getinfo are external function calls whose internals are not shown here; they may need separate inspection but are not string.h usages in this fragment. No other memcpy/memmove/memcmp/strncpy/strncat/strlen/strspn/strcmp/etc. occurrences exist in the provided code, so no additional fragments are flagged."
