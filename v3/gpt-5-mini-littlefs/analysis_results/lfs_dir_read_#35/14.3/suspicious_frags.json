  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions in the function do not appear invariant and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: the checks if (dir->pos == 0) and else if (dir->pos == 1) depend on dir->pos and update it; if (dir->id == dir->m.count) depends on mutable state dir->id and dir->m.count; if (!dir->m.split) depends on object state; the checks of function return values (if (err) and if (err && err != LFS_ERR_NOENT) and later if (err != LFS_ERR_NOENT)) all depend on the results of called functions and local variable err. These are not compile-time or invariant controlling expressions. The only invariant controlling expression present is the while (true) loop, which should be examined to determine whether the use of an invariant expression is intended (e.g. an intentional infinite loop with explicit exits) and compliant with the rule's exceptions."
