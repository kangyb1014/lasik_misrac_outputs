  "explanation": "Fragments not reported do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they clearly require writable (non-const) pointers or are not pointer declarations/uses that the rule targets: - memset(info, 0, sizeof(*info)); and subsequent writes (strcpy(info->name, \".\") / strcpy(info->name, \"..\")) show that 'info' is intentionally modified, so it must not be const-qualified. - The function updates members of 'dir' (dir->pos, dir->id), so 'dir' cannot be const. - Uses of dir->m.tail, dir->m.count, dir->m.split and increments/assignments to dir->id indicate mutable access to dir->m; those member accesses are not candidates for const qualification. - Loop control, comparisons, and return statements do not involve pointer declarations that could be const-qualified. The three reported fragments should be investigated to determine whether the lfs pointer parameter (and the address-of dir->m passed into called routines) could be declared to point to const-qualified types without violating intended mutation semantics or the called functions' requirements."
