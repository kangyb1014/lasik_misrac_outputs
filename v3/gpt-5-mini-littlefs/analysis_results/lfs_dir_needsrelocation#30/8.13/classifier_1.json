  "scenario": "The function lfs_dir_needsrelocation takes parameters lfs_t *lfs and lfs_mdir_t *dir but only reads from them (uses lfs->cfg->block_cycles and dir->rev). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 these pointers should be to const-qualified types when possible (e.g., const lfs_t *lfs, const lfs_mdir_t *dir, and any intermediate cfg pointer to const). Because the parameters are not const-qualified even though they could be, the rule is violated."
