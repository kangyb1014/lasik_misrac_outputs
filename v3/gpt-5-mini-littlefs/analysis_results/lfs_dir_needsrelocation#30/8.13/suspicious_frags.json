  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer types could be const-qualified. The provided snippet contains only two pointer parameters (the function signature) and dereferences of those pointers inside the return expression. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer uses in this snippet to consider. Non-pointer elements (comments, integer arithmetic, modulus and bitwise operators, the boolean return type, braces, and formatting) are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore do not require investigation."
