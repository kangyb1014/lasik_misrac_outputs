  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "In lfs_dir_needsrelocation the parameter is declared as lfs_mdir_t *dir but the function only reads dir->rev (no modification). The pointer therefore could be declared const lfs_mdir_t *dir to express that the pointee is not modified. Because the non-const pointer is used where a const-qualified pointer is possible, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
