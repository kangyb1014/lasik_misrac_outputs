Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have flagged the function declaration (static scope) and the full return expression plus its subexpressions because they are the operations that could be effectively constant or unused at project build/runtime (making them candidates for dead code). Everything else in the snippet is either commentary or syntactic (braces, comments, spacing) and does not constitute executable operations that could be dead code. There are no other distinct statements, variable initializations, or side-effecting operations in the provided code fragment, so no other fragments require investigation."
