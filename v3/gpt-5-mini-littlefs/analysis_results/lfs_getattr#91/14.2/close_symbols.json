The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- lfs_getattr_: This is the direct callee that implements the work. Any for-loops that contribute to the behaviour of lfs_getattr (and therefore to the target function) will be in this function. Must inspect its loop headers and bodies.\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_min, lfs_tag_size: These are the functions called by lfs_getattr_ (per the static call graph). The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including calls made inside that body, so we must inspect each callee for loops, side effects, modifications of potential loop counters or loop-control flags, and for any objects they read or modify that appear in loop clauses.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: These macros/functions are used in the target wrapper. Although no for-loop appears in the wrapper itself, their expansions could have side effects or use global state that interacts with loops in callees; include them to rule out unexpected modifications to loop control objects or side effects relevant to MISRA requirements.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t, struct lfs_config: Type definitions and the filesystem config structure are needed to recognize which identifiers are objects (possible loop counters or control flags) versus temporary values. They are also needed to identify fields (for example lfs->cfg) that could be referenced/modified by loops or callees.\n\n- any global/static variables referenced by lfs_getattr_ and its callees: MISRA requires that loop second/third clauses not use objects modified in the loop body. To check this you must see all globals/statics those functions access or modify (filesystem state, caches, indices, etc.). Because these globals are not enumerated in the provided graph, include them generically for inspection.\n\nUsing these symbols the next analyst can inspect all loop headers and bodies (in lfs_getattr_ and all functions it calls), determine which identifiers are loop counters or flags, and verify that the three clauses of each for loop satisfy the MISRA constraints (no persistent side effects in the second clause, third clause only modifies the loop counter, no other objects modified in the loop body used in clauses, only one loop counter, etc.)."
