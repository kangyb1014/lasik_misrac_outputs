  "explanation": "Each listed symbol may hide compiler-specific language extensions that are not obvious from the caller code and therefore must be inspected to determine MISRA compliance:\n\n- lfs_ssize_t: typedef/definition could be an alias to a compiler-provided/nonstandard type (e.g. ssize_t) or use compiler-specific attributes or extensions.\n- lfs_size_t: same reasons as lfs_ssize_t; its definition may use nonstandard types or attributes.\n- lfs_t: the filesystem context struct may include flexible-array members, bitfields, or compiler attributes (e.g. __attribute__, packed, aligned) which are language extensions.\n- uint8_t: defined in stdint.h; ensure it is the standard typedef and not a compiler-specific alias or macro.\n- LFS_LOCK: macro/function that implements locking; its definition may use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, GCC-only variadic macro forms, etc.).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same justification as LFS_LOCK.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro is a prime candidate for using compiler extensions (variadic macros, __VA_ARGS__ tricks, __func__/__PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __attribute__((format)), or other vendor-specific features). Inspect its definition for extensions.\n- lfs_getattr_: the called helper could be declared with attributes (format, noinline, unused), inline assembly, or other compiler-specific qualifiers; its prototype/definition is needed to see if the call uses extensions that affect the caller.\n- PRIu8, PRIu32, PRId32: format macros normally come from inttypes.h (C99). If these are redefined or provided by a nonstandard header they could be compiler-specific. Confirm their origin/definition.\n- inttypes.h: include/definitions must be checked to ensure the format macros are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n- stdint.h: include/definitions must be checked to ensure fixed-width integer types (uint8_t) are from the standard header and not provided via compiler extensions.\n\nInspecting these symbols (typedefs, macros, headers and called-function prototype/definition) is necessary because language extensions may appear in macro implementations, typedefs, struct declarations, or function attributes rather than in the simple call-site shown. Only by examining these definitions can you determine whether the target function uses any compiler-specific extensions."
