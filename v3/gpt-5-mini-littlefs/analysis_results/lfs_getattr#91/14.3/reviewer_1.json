Thus the controlling expression is invariant and the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_getattr:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. err is initialized from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), and the provided macro LFS_LOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg, 0), so err is always 0. The controlling expression if (err) is therefore an invariant false expression. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions, and the listed exceptions (infinite loops or the specific do-while case) do not apply to an if statement. Thus the code violates Rule 14.3 as reported."
