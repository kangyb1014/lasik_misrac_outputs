  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following lfs_getattr code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 14.3.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\nHere are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe controlling expression is invariant because err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), and LFS_LOCK is defined as ((void)cfg,0). Thus err is always 0 and the test if (err) is always false (invariant). This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. With the provided macro definition LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0) the assignment err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) always yields 0, so the controlling expression if (err) is an invariant (always false) in this translation unit. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions and the two listed exceptions (infinite-loop invariants and the specific do-while constant-false case) do not apply to this if statement. (If LFS_LOCK is intended to be a configurable macro that in other builds expands to a non-constant locking routine, then a checker that evaluates the translation unit with the shown definition will rightly report a violation; otherwise the code should be reworked or conditionally compiled to avoid the invariant test.)"
