  "explanation": "- lfs_getattr_: The target calls lfs_getattr_. Although callee-side reassignments do not change the caller's parameter variables, lfs_getattr_ could be a macro or inline function expanded into the caller scope. We must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not expand to code that assigns to any of lfs_getattr's parameter identifiers (lfs, path, type, buffer, size).\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. LFS_LOCK may be a macro (or inline) that could expand into code referencing or assigning identifiers in the caller scope. We need its definition to confirm it does not modify the parameter variables (for example reassigning lfs, path, buffer, etc.).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the unlock operation at function exit; inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to any function parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing is often a macro that expands into code using the arguments. If it is a macro it could (mis)use or assign to parameter identifiers. We need its expansion to confirm it does not modify any parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): To check whether expressions like lfs->cfg might hide macros or overloaded identifiers, and to understand what lfs->cfg refers to, the lfs_t struct/type definition is needed. This also helps determine whether any invoked macros/functions operate on the pointer itself or on the pointed-to object (modifying the object is allowed; reassigning the parameter variable is not).\n\n- definition of lfs->cfg's type / lock implementation: The exact type of lfs->cfg and the implementation used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (if they call functions or manipulate cfg fields) must be checked to ensure those implementations do not contain code that assigns to the caller's parameter identifiers."
