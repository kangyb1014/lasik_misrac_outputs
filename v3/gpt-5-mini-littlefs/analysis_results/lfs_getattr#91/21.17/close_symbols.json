  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for out-of-bounds uses of <string.h> functions:\n\n- lfs_getattr_: This is the direct implementation invoked by lfs_getattr. Any uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn (or other string-handling calls) inside lfs_getattr_ will determine whether the public wrapper lfs_getattr can cause out-of-bounds accesses. You must inspect its body.\n\n- lfs_dir_find: lfs_getattr_ calls this to locate directory entries by path/name. Directory lookup code commonly compares or copies name strings (memcmp, strncpy, strlen, etc.). You must inspect lfs_dir_find for any string.h usage and how it indexes/limits name buffers.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Directory fetch routines frequently read blocks and copy directory contents into memory buffers (memcpy/memmove/memset). If lfs_dir_fetch copies name or entry data, you must verify the source/destination sizes and bounds checks.\n\n- lfs_dir_get: Higher-level directory-entry accessor that may copy a filename or attributes into user-supplied buffers (buffer parameter in lfs_getattr). If it uses memcpy/strncpy/strlen, you must check it enforces the provided size limit and does not write beyond the user buffer.\n\n- lfs_tag_id and lfs_tag_size: These are used by lfs_getattr_ for parsing metadata/tags. While they may not directly use string.h, they influence sizes/lengths computed for attributes and name fields; include them to see whether computed sizes are used as lengths in subsequent string/memory functions.\n\n- lfs_min: Utility to compute minimums; often used to bound copy lengths (e.g. copy length = min(src_len, dest_size)). You need its definition to verify that bounds-limiting logic used before string/memory functions is correct.\n\n- struct lfs_t: The filesystem handle contains pointers/state used by lfs_getattr_ and its callees (e.g. pointers to caches, buffers). Understanding its layout is necessary to check where buffers come from and their sizes.\n\n- struct lfs_config (lfs->cfg) and its relevant fields (e.g. name_max, attr_max, block sizes): Configuration parameters define maximum name/attribute lengths and buffer allocations. Any string/memory operations must be compared against these limits to ensure they cannot overflow.\n\n- typedefs lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: To reason about signed/unsigned length arithmetic and check for underflow/overflow in bounds calculations before calling string/memory functions.\n\nIn short: include the implementation of lfs_getattr_ and all functions it calls that touch path/name/attribute data, plus the filesystem handle/config definitions and size typedefs so you can verify any calls to the listed <string.h> functions use correct, bounded lengths and do not write/read beyond their buffers."
