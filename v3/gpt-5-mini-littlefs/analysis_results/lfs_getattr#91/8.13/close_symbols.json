  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters in lfs_getattr (particularly void *buffer and const char *path) should be const-qualified we must inspect what the target calls and the types involved:\n\n- lfs_getattr_: The direct worker called by lfs_getattr. You must see its prototype and implementation to determine whether it writes to or modifies the memory pointed to by buffer or path (if it does not modify them they could be const-qualified).\n\n- lfs_dir_find / lfs_dir_fetch / lfs_dir_get: These are called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_getattr_ according to the call graph. They are likely to accept buffers or pointers to directory/attribute data. Inspecting their prototypes/implementations will show whether the pointer passed as buffer is used for output (written) or only read \u2014 crucial to whether buffer can be const.\n\n- lfs_tag_id / lfs_tag_size: These helper/tag functions are called by lfs_getattr_. While they may not operate on buffer directly, their signatures and use may reveal whether tag data is treated as mutable or const and whether any pointer parameters are modified; include them to be sure no indirect writes occur that affect const-qualification decisions.\n\n- lfs_min: Utility called by lfs_getattr_. If it is used to compute sizes passed along with buffer pointers, you need to inspect how those sizes interact with functions that may write into buffer. (This is to ensure we understand whether buffer is used as an output area.)\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t: Type definitions for the filesystem context and size/return types used in the signature. Knowing the exact typedefs is necessary to confirm pointer constness semantics (for example, whether any typedef expands to a pointer type, or whether sizes/ssize affect pointer usage or casts).\n\nExamining these symbols (their prototypes and bodies) lets you trace whether the buffer/path pointers are ever written to or passed to callees that write to them. If they are only read, MISRA requires they be const-qualified; if they are written, non-const is justified."
