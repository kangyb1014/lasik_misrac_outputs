  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for the MISRA memcmp-on-strings check:\n\n- lfs_t (full struct/type definition): The function dereferences lfs to access members. The lfs_t definition can show if any members are implemented via inline functions, macros, or function pointers that might call memcmp, or if the struct embeds character/string types. We must inspect lfs_t to ensure no indirect use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- lfs->lookahead member/type (definition of the lookahead sub-structure): This sub-structure is accessed directly; its definition reveals the exact types and semantics of start, size, and buffer. If lookahead or its accessors invoke memcmp (e.g., via inline helpers) or if buffer is text data (char*), that would be relevant for the MISRA rule.\n\n- lfs_block_t (typedef): The integer/typedef used for block arithmetic. Knowing its base type (signed/unsigned width) rules out hidden conversions to char*/string operations and ensures the arithmetic here cannot be a disguised pointer/string comparison.\n\n- lookahead.start (type and semantics): The code computes an offset from start; if start were a pointer (e.g., char*), that could indicate string handling. Confirming start is a numeric block index (not a pointer to characters) is necessary to conclude no memcmp-on-strings is happening.\n\n- lookahead.size (type and semantics): Ensures size is a numeric length/count, not e.g. a string length accessor or function-like macro that could call memcmp.\n\n- lookahead.buffer (declaration: element type and pointer/array nature): The code writes into buffer via byte indexing and bit operations. If buffer is an array of char (signed/unsigned) or a char*, this matters because memcmp is commonly used to compare char buffers; we must inspect the buffer type to determine whether any future/related code could treat it as null-terminated strings or use memcmp on it. Also check for any buffer-related inline helpers/macros that might call memcmp.\n\n- lfs->block_count (declaration and type): Used in the modulo calculation. Knowing its type ensures that arithmetic is on integer block indices rather than pointer arithmetic or other types that could be tied to string operations.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no call to memcmp. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to (1) verify the accessed fields are numeric/index data (not character/string pointers), and (2) rule out any indirect/inline/function-pointer uses of memcmp reachable from those members. If any of these symbols reveal inline functions, macros, or function pointers, include those additional definitions in the next analysis step so the use of memcmp can be determined precisely."
