  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression if (off < lfs->lookahead.size) is invariant you must know the exact types, storage/qualifiers, and constness of the operands that determine both sides of the comparison and the computation of off. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_t: the structure type is required to locate the member declarations and their types/qualifiers (so you can see whether members are const/volatile or compile-time constants).\n- lfs_t::lookahead (the nested struct/type): the lookahead member's type defines which fields exist (start, size, buffer) and their semantics.\n- lfs->lookahead.start: appears in the computation of off; you must know its type and whether it is modifiable at run time (if it is a compile-time constant or const-qualified then off may become invariant).\n- lfs->lookahead.size: the right-hand side of the controlling expression; you must know if this is a runtime-modifiable value or a compile-time/const constant (if it cannot change the if expression may be invariant).\n- lfs->lookahead.buffer: its type (e.g. uint8_t*) and indexing semantics are not directly part of the controlling expression but are needed to check for side-effects or undefined behaviour that might affect analysis assumptions (and to confirm no hidden interaction that would make the condition non-invariant).\n- lfs->block_count: used in the off computation (addition and modulo). If block_count is a compile-time constant (or equals 1, etc.) or const-qualified, off may reduce to an invariant value regardless of block; you must know its value/type/qualifier.\n- lfs_block_t: the typedef for the block parameter and the struct members \u2014 underlying integer type and signedness/width affect whether arithmetic and modulo produce variable results or well-defined constant results.\n- Any compile-time macros/defines that set lookahead.size or block_count (e.g. LFS_LOOKAHEAD_SIZE, LFS_BLOCK_COUNT): if size or block_count are in fact macros or constant expressions, the controlling expression may be invariant at compile time.\n- Type qualifiers on those members (const/volatile): const can make a member effectively invariant; volatile can make a value appear non-invariant to a MISRA analysis. You must know these qualifiers for start, size and block_count.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions lets the next analyser determine whether off and/or lfs->lookahead.size are effectively invariant in the function (or by compile-time definitions), and therefore whether the if controlling expression violates the MISRA rule."
