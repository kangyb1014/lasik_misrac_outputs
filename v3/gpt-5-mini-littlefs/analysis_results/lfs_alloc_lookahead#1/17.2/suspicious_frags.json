  "explanation": "The function lfs_alloc_lookahead contains no function calls (no direct calls, no function-pointer dereferences or invocations), and does not reference any other functions. It performs only casts, arithmetic, indexing, and a bitwise operation, then returns 0. Therefore there is no direct or indirect recursion visible in this fragment and nothing here needs investigation for Rule 17.2. No other code fragments in the provided snippet introduce calls that could form recursion."
