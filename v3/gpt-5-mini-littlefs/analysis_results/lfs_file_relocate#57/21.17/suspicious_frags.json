  "explanation": "Only the memcpy call uses a string.h memory function that can cause out-of-bounds accesses; it must be investigated to ensure file->cache.buffer and lfs->pcache.buffer are at least lfs->cfg->cache_size bytes and that the pointers do not overlap in an unsafe way. Other fragments do not call functions from <string.h> (reads/writes use lfs_bd_read/lfs_bd_prog with explicit size 1, allocation/erase/flags manipulations are not string.h operations, and control flow/goto/cache helpers are not relevant to Rule 21.17), so they do not need investigation under this rule."
