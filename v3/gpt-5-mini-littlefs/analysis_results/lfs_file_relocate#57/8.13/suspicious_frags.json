  "explanation": "Fragments not listed have been inspected and are not considered suspicious for Rule 8.13 because the pointed-to objects are clearly modified or used as destinations and therefore cannot be made const:\n- The function parameters (lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) are modified in the body (e.g. file->block, file->flags, file->cache fields are assigned), and lfs state is modified by calls such as lfs_alloc and cache operations, so these pointers cannot be const.\n- Calls to lfs_alloc(nblock), lfs_bd_erase(nblock) and the surrounding error handling clearly change storage state and/or rely on non-const pointers.\n- Assignments to file members (file->block = nblock; file->flags |= LFS_F_WRITING; memcpy to file->cache.buffer; updates to file->cache.*) modify the pointed-to data, so those pointers cannot be const.\n- The loop control and scalar locals (e.g. lfs_off_t i, uint8_t data) are non-pointer uses and unrelated to pointer const-qualification.\n- LFS_DEBUG and goto/label mechanics do not involve pointer constness.\n- Any calls that obviously alter cache state (lfs_cache_zero, lfs_cache_drop) are included only when they pass a cache pointer; when a function is known to modify the cache it is not a candidate for making the parameter const.\n\nThe listed suspicious fragments are places where non-const pointers (addresses of file->m, file->cache, lfs->rcache, lfs->pcache, and buffer pointers) are passed to functions or used in ways that may only require read access; these should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types could be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
