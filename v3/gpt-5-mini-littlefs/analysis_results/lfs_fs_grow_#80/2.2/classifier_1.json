Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_grow_:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_fs_grow_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_size_t block_count) {\n    int err;\n\n    if (block_count == lfs->block_count) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    \n#ifndef LFS_SHRINKNONRELOCATING\n    // shrinking is not supported\n    LFS_ASSERT(block_count >= lfs->block_count);\n#endif\n#ifdef LFS_SHRINKNONRELOCATING\n    if (block_count < lfs->block_count) {\n        err = lfs_fs_traverse_(lfs, lfs_shrink_checkblock, &block_count, true);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n#endif\n\n    lfs->block_count = block_count;\n\n    // fetch the root\n    lfs_mdir_t root;\n    err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &root, lfs->root);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // update the superblock\n    lfs_superblock_t superblock;\n    lfs_stag_t tag = lfs_dir_get(lfs, &root, LFS_MKTAG(0x7ff, 0x3ff, 0),\n            LFS_MKTAG(LFS_TYPE_INLINESTRUCT, 0, sizeof(superblock)),\n            &superblock);\n    if (tag < 0) {\n        return tag;\n    }\n    lfs_superblock_fromle32(&superblock);\n\n    superblock.block_count = lfs->block_count;\n\n    lfs_superblock_tole32(&superblock);\n    err = lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &root, LFS_MKATTRS(\n            {tag, &superblock}));\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_grow_:\ntypedef uint32_t lfs_size_t\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nlfs_superblock_fromle32(&superblock);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to lfs_superblock_fromle32(&superblock) converts the fetched superblock fields from little-endian to host-endian so they can be safely inspected/modified before being converted back to little-endian and written out. Removing this call could change behaviour on non-little-endian targets (other fields would be in the wrong byte order and lfs_dir_commit would write incorrect data), so the call is not dead code. (Note: if in the specific project the fromle32 implementation is a compile-time no-op for the only supported target and the call has no effect, then in that build it would be unnecessary; but given the general code as shown, it is required.)"
