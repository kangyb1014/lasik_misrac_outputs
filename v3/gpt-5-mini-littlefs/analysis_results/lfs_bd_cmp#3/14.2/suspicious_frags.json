First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The for-loop header is flagged because the third clause (i += diff) uses the object 'diff' which is also modified inside the loop body; this interaction requires investigation against Rule 14.2. The declaration and the assignment to 'diff' are included because they establish and modify the object that the third clause depends on, and so are relevant to determining compliance. Other fragments (loop initialization 'lfs_off_t i = 0', the loop condition 'i < size', uses of 'size', the memcmp and return statements, and the lfs_bd_read call arguments other than those involving 'i' and 'diff') do not introduce additional loop counters or use objects modified in the loop body in the loop clauses, and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 14.2."
