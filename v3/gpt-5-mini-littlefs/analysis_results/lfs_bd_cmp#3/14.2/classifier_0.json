  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_bd_cmp:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_bd_cmp(lfs_t *lfs,\n        const lfs_cache_t *pcache, lfs_cache_t *rcache, lfs_size_t hint,\n        lfs_block_t block, lfs_off_t off,\n        const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    const uint8_t *data = buffer;\n    lfs_size_t diff = 0;\n\n    for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff) {\n        uint8_t dat[8];\n\n        diff = lfs_min(size-i, sizeof(dat));\n        int err = lfs_bd_read(lfs,\n                pcache, rcache, hint-i,\n                block, off+i, &dat, diff);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        int res = memcmp(dat, data + i, diff);\n        if (res) {\n            return res < 0 ?

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The for loop's third clause is 'i += diff', but 'diff' is assigned inside the loop body via 'diff = lfs_min(size - i, sizeof(dat));'. Rule 14.2 forbids the third clause from using objects that are modified in the loop body, so using 'diff' (modified inside the loop) to update the loop counter violates the rule."
