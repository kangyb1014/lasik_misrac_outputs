First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Clause 3 of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 forbids the loop iteration expression from using objects that are modified in the loop body. In the code the third clause is \"i += diff\" while the object diff is assigned inside the loop body (diff = lfs_min(...)). The execution log also shows diff changing between iterations. Therefore the for-loop violates Rule 14.2 (clause 3)."
