  "explanation": "The only places that modify scalar function parameters are in lfs_bd_read where the parameters 'off' and 'size' are incremented/decremented in the loop. Modifying the contents of objects pointed to by pointer parameters (for example rcache->block, rcache->off, rcache->size, or memcpy into data which is a local pointer derived from buffer) is permitted by the rule. The lfs_bd_cmp function does not assign to its parameter variables (it only computes and passes adjusted values to lfs_bd_read and uses a local pointer 'data'), so it does not violate the rule. Therefore only the statements that mutate the scalar parameters in lfs_bd_read need further investigation."
