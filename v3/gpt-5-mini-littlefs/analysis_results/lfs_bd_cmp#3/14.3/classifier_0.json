  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The controlling expression is i < size, and i is modified each iteration by i += diff. Inside the loop diff is assigned diff = lfs_min(size - i, sizeof(dat)); since sizeof(dat) == 8 and the loop body is entered only when size > i, diff will be at least 1, so i advances and the controlling expression is not invariant. The case size == 0 simply prevents loop entry. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated."
