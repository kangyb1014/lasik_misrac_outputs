  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions in this function do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the two if-statements (if (err) and if (res)) depend on values (err, res) that are assigned within the loop body each iteration, so they are not invariant. The final return is not a controlling expression. The assignment to diff and the memcmp call provide changing state across iterations. The only loop control expression present is the for-loop header listed above; no do-while or other constant controlling expressions exist in the function."
