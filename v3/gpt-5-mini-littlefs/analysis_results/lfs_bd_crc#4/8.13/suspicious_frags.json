  "explanation": "Only code fragments that involve pointers or pointer usage are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The selected fragments cover the function parameter list (where pointer parameters appear) and the two call-sites where a buffer is passed by address. Other parts of the function do not introduce pointer types or pointer parameters that could be qualified with const and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: the loop control (for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff)), scalar/local non-pointer variables (diff, i, hint, block, off, size), the calculation expressions (diff = lfs_min(size-i, sizeof(dat)); hint-i, off+i), the error-check/return paths (if (err) { return err; } and return 0;), and calls to lfs_min and lfs_crc invocation context (aside from the argument pointer shown) do not present additional pointer-to-non-const situations to check for Rule 8.13. PCache is already const-qualified in the signature and thus does not require further inspection for this rule."
