  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code passes the address of a non-const uint8_t array (dat) to lfs_bd_read, which is expected to write into that buffer; therefore the pointer must not be const. Only if lfs_bd_read were (incorrectly) declared to take a pointer-to-const (e.g. const void *) while actually modifying the buffer would Rule 8.13 be violated."
