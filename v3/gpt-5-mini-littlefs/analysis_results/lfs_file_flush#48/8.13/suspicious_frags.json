  "explanation": "I found no pointer declarations in this function that appear to be non-const when they could (MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13). Reasoning for not flagging any fragments:\n\n- Function parameters: lfs_t *lfs and lfs_file_t *file are both used to modify state inside the function (file->flags, file->pos, file->ctz, and operations that alter lfs->rcache and caches). Therefore they cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- Local object orig is an lfs_file_t value (not a pointer). Its .cache field and other members are used and modified (lfs_cache_drop is later called on &orig.cache), so orig cannot be const.\n\n- Addresses taken and passed to helper functions (e.g., &file->cache, &lfs->rcache, &orig.cache, &data) are used by those helpers to modify caches or to provide a destination buffer for reads. These uses require mutable targets, so they should not be const.\n\n- Passing &data to the write function is acceptable even if that function takes a pointer-to-const for the buffer parameter; that would be a compatibility of passing a mutable object to a const parameter and does not violate 8.13 in this translation unit.\n\nGiven each pointer usage is either modified directly in this function or is passed to callees that plausibly modify the pointed-to data (or are used as output buffers), there are no obvious places in this snippet where pointers should be changed to point to const-qualified types."
