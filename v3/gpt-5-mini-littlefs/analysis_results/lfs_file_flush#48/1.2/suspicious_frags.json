  "explanation": "I found no usages of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The constructs present and why they are not flagged:\n\n- Designated initializers (e.g. lfs_file_t orig = { .ctz.head = ..., .ctz.size = ... };) are standard C (C99/C11) and are not a compiler extension.\n- Single-line // comments and the use of true are standard (C99/stdbool.h) rather than compiler extensions.\n- String literal concatenation with format macros (\"0x%\"PRIx32) and use of standard integer types (uint8_t, uint16_t) are standard C facilities.\n- goto, labels, while(true), casts like (lfs_block_t)-1, and struct initializers are standard C constructs.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions were found (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __declspec, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values, or other vendor-specific keywords). Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) in this snippet."
