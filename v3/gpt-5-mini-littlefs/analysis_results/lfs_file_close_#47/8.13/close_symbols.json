  "explanation": "To determine if pointers in lfs_file_close_ should be const-qualified you must know the exact declared types (including const qualifiers) of all pointers touched or cast in the function:\n\n- lfs_file_t (full struct/type definition): the function parameter is lfs_file_t *file and several member accesses are used (file->cfg, file->cache). You need the declaration to know whether those members are already const-qualified and whether the file pointer itself could/should be declared const.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (full struct/type definition): the code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*) and calls lfs_mlist_remove. You must inspect the mlist type to see whether its pointer fields or expected constness would be violated by the cast or by passing a non-const pointer.\n\n- lfs_mlist_remove (function prototype/signature): the parameter types (e.g., struct lfs_mlist * vs const struct lfs_mlist *) determine whether removing from the list requires a mutable pointer or could accept a const pointer; this affects whether the cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file is safe with respect to const qualification.\n\n- lfs_free (function prototype/signature): inspect the parameter type (typically void *) to see whether freeing is declared to take a non-const pointer. If cache.buffer is declared const-qualified, passing it to lfs_free would drop const qualification and could violate the rule.\n\n- definition/type of file->cfg (the type of the cfg member and its declaration): the code checks file->cfg->buffer; you must know whether file->cfg is a pointer to const config or non-const, and whether its buffer member is declared const (e.g., const void *buffer). This determines whether accessing/freeing buffer drops const.\n\n- definition/type of file->cache and its buffer member (the cache field type and the type of cache.buffer): the code conditionally calls lfs_free(file->cache.buffer) when file->cfg->buffer is falsy. You must know the exact type of cache.buffer (is it void *, uint8_t *, const uint8_t *, etc.) to decide if passing it to lfs_free or freeing it removes const qualification.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and prototypes) lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer-to-const qualification is dropped or should be added to satisfy the MISRA rule."
