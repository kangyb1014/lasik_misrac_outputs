  "explanation": "The only controlling statement in the function is the if-statement shown above; its controlling expression should be investigated for being invariant. The preprocessor conditional (#ifndef LFS_READONLY / #else / #endif) is a compile-time directive, not a runtime controlling expression and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3. Other lines are function calls, assignments, or a return statement (lfs_file_sync_ call / lfs_mlist_remove call / int err = ... / return err;) and do not contain controlling expressions that could violate the rule, so they do not require investigation under Rule 14.3."
