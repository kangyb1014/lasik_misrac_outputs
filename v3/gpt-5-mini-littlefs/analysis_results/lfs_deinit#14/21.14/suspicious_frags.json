  "explanation": "I inspected the provided lfs_deinit implementation and the related type definitions. There are no calls to memcmp (nor any other string-comparison functions) in the function or in the supplied structs. The function only checks pointer fields in cfg and calls lfs_free on cache/lookahead buffers; the additional type definitions are only data layout and contain no code that could use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
