  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the if-body is executed when lfs->cfg->prog_buffer == NULL, so it is not inherently unreachable. A Rule 2.1 violation would occur only if prog_buffer is provably always non-NULL (for example, cfg->prog_buffer is declared as an array or otherwise statically guaranteed to have a non-zero address, or is initialized to a non-NULL constant before this call), making the condition always false and the lfs_free call unreachable."
