  "explanation": "- lfs_t: needed to see whether the parameter named lfs is an ordinary pointer variable (so assigning to it would violate MISRA) or is subject to unusual definitions (e.g. a macro or typedef with side effects). Also required to inspect how its members are declared.\n- (type of) lfs->cfg and its members read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer: the code tests these members with if (!lfs->cfg->...); you must verify these are plain data members (pointers/flags) and not macros or accessor functions that could modify the parameter lfs when evaluated.\n- (type of) lfs->rcache and its member buffer: lfs->rcache.buffer is passed to lfs_free. You need the declaration to ensure this is a simple member access and not a macro/inline function with side effects on lfs.\n- (type of) lfs->pcache and its member buffer: same reason as rcache.buffer \u2014 confirm plain member access and no side effects on the parameter.\n- (type of) lfs->lookahead and its member buffer: same reason as above for lookahead.buffer.\n- lfs_free (prototype/definition): lfs_free is called with members of lfs; examine its prototype/implementation to ensure it cannot modify the lfs parameter (e.g. via global pointers, container_of tricks, or by taking lfs itself through some macro). In particular, confirm lfs_free does not (directly or indirectly through macros) assign to the function parameter lfs.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst determine whether the code performs any assignment to the parameter variable lfs or evaluates expressions/macros that could modify it, which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
