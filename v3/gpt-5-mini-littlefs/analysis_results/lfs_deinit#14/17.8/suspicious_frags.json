  "explanation": "No code fragment in lfs_deinit modifies the function parameter pointer lfs itself. The function only reads lfs->cfg and accesses fields of the object pointed to by lfs (e.g., lfs->rcache.buffer, lfs->pcache.buffer, lfs->lookahead.buffer) and calls lfs_free on those buffers. Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8; the prohibition applies to changing the pointer variable (for example by assignment like lfs = ..., increment/decrement of lfs, or taking its address and modifying it). There are no such operations here. The cfg member is a pointer-to-const and is only read. Although lfs_free may alter the memory pointed to by the buffer fields (or the fields themselves), that constitutes modification of the object referred to by the pointer parameter, which is allowed by the rule. Therefore no fragments require further investigation under Rule 17.8."
