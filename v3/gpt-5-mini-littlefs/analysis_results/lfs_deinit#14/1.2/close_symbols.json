  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions listed to determine whether any language/compiler extensions are being used by the code invoked or accessed in lfs_deinit. Specifically:\n\n- lfs_free: Need the declaration/definition (or macro expansion) to see if it is implemented using compiler extensions (e.g., GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, inline extensions, asm, __extension__, or other non-standard constructs). If lfs_free is a macro, the macro body must be checked for extensions.\n\n- lfs_t: The full typedef/struct is required to confirm that its declaration uses only standard C and does not rely on implementation-specific keywords or extensions (bit-field types, anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific attributes, etc.).\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g., struct lfs_config): The config struct definition is needed to verify that the fields read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer are standard declarations and that cfg itself is not declared using compiler extensions (for example, non-standard attributes, anonymous members, or exotic storage-class specifiers).\n\n- types of lfs->rcache, lfs->pcache, lfs->lookahead and their 'buffer' members: The types and member declarations must be checked to ensure the code is not relying on language extensions (anonymous structs/unions, GCC attributes, typeof-based macros, flexible array usage beyond standard, etc.).\n\nIn short, inspect the definitions of any called functions/macros (lfs_free) and the full type definitions for any objects accessed inside lfs_deinit. Those are the only places additional, hidden language extensions could appear that would make lfs_deinit violate the MISRA rule."
