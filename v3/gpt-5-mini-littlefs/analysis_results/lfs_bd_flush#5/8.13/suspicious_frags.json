  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: pcache->block and pcache->off are scalar integer fields (not pointers) and thus not subject to pointer const-qualification. Calls to lfs_cache_drop(lfs, rcache) and lfs_cache_zero(lfs, pcache) indicate that the cache objects (pcache, rcache) are modified by this function or by callee functions, so their pointer parameters cannot generally be made pointers-to-const. The NULL literal passed to lfs_bd_cmp is not a named pointer variable that can be const-qualified here. LFS_ASSERT and the early return/err handling do not introduce pointer targets that could/should be const-qualified. Therefore the remaining pointer uses are either non-pointer data, or are intentionally mutable and not candidates for const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
