  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that reassign or modify the function parameters themselves (lfs, pcache, rcache, validate). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a parameter object (e.g., pcache = ..., ++rcache, validate = false). This function performs no such operations: there are no assignments to lfs, pcache, rcache, or validate. The only mutations are to objects pointed-to by pointer parameters via function calls (lfs_cache_drop(lfs, rcache) and lfs_cache_zero(lfs, pcache)), and those are permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). Local variable diff is a local object and not a parameter. Therefore no fragments require investigation under Rule 17.8."
