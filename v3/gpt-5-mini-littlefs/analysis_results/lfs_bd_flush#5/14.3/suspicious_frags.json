  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (compile-time constant) in the provided code. Each conditional and loop depends on runtime values:\n\n- if (pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_NULL && pcache->block != LFS_BLOCK_INLINE): depends on the runtime value of pcache->block (compares against constants). Not a constant controlling expression.\n- LFS_ASSERT(pcache->block < lfs->block_count) and LFS_ASSERT(err <= 0): both assertions test runtime values (pcache->block, lfs->block_count, err). Even though ASSERT may expand to an if internally, the controlling expressions are not invariant.\n- if (err) and subsequent checks (if (res < 0), if (res != LFS_CMP_EQ), if (validate)): all depend on runtime results/parameters.\n- The for loop in lfs_bd_cmp (for (lfs_off_t i = 0; i < size; i += diff)) clearly depends on the runtime variable size and on diff computed inside the loop (diff = lfs_min(size-i, sizeof(dat))). When the loop is entered, diff is computed from size-i and sizeof(dat) (non-zero if size>0), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\nNo do-while with a constant false expression or infinite-loop constant expressions (e.g., while(1)) are present. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
