  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function contains no function calls (no direct call to itself), no invocation of function pointers, and no function-like macro invocations: it only returns either the lfs->cfg->disk_version member or the LFS_DISK_VERSION token. The (void)lfs; line simply suppresses an unused-parameter warning when LFS_MULTIVERSION is not defined. There is no code here that can directly or indirectly call this function (no calls, no pointer dereferences used as calls, and LFS_DISK_VERSION is used as an identifier without parentheses so it is not a function-like macro invocation). Therefore, nothing in this fragment needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
