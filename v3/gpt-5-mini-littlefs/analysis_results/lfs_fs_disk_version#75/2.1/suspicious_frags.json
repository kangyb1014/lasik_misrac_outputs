  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious unreachable code fragments found. Reasoning:\n- With LFS_MULTIVERSION defined, the function compiles to an if/else that returns either lfs->cfg->disk_version or LFS_DISK_VERSION; both return branches are reachable at runtime depending on the value of lfs->cfg->disk_version, so neither branch is intrinsically unreachable.\n- With LFS_MULTIVERSION not defined, the preprocessor removes the #ifdef block and the function contains a single return of LFS_DISK_VERSION; that return is reachable and there is no code after it, so there is no unreachable code.\n- The (void)lfs; statement is intentionally present to suppress unused-parameter warnings when LFS_MULTIVERSION is not defined; it is executed and not unreachable.\n- There are no statements after unconditional returns that would be unreachable.\nTherefore no code fragments in the provided function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
