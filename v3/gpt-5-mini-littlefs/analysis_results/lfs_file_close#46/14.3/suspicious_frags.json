  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: there are no other controlling statements (no while, for, do-while, switch) in this function besides the reported if. The LFS_TRACE macro is empty (no control flow). The assignment to err and the subsequent call to lfs_file_close_ are ordinary expressions, not controlling expressions. LFS_UNLOCK is a void macro and not a controlling statement. The LFS_ASSERT usage is an assertion macro for diagnostics (assert(test)) rather than a language-level controlling statement in this translation unit; any conditional behavior inside library macros should be reviewed in their own definitions if necessary. Therefore the only potential invariant controlling expression in this code is the if (err) tied to the LFS_LOCK macro shown above."
