  "explanation": "To decide if any controlling expression in lfs_file_close is invariant you must inspect the macros/types that produce those expressions and whether assertions/logging are compiled out.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The if(err) controlling expression uses the return value of LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must see LFS_LOCK's definition/signature to determine whether it yields a non-constant runtime result (e.g. calls a function, checks runtime state) or whether it expands to a compile-time constant or no-op, which would make the controlling expression invariant.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Even though it is not itself a controlling expression, its implementation can show whether LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are no-ops or stubbed (e.g. both expand to nothing or constants). That information is useful to judge invariance of LFS_LOCK's result and the intended locking semantics.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: The code contains LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(...)). LFS_ASSERT typically expands to a conditional that contains a controlling expression; you must inspect its definition to determine (a) whether it introduces a controlling expression in builds, and (b) whether that controlling expression can be an invariant (for MISRA rule consideration).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros sometimes expand to conditionals (e.g. if (TRACE_ENABLED) ...) or to nothing. Inspecting LFS_TRACE ensures it does not introduce any additional controlling expressions that might be invariant.\n\n- lfs_t (struct) and its cfg member type: To reason about LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) you need the type and semantics of cfg (what data LFS_LOCK reads). If cfg is a compile-time constant or if LFS_LOCK only inspects constant fields, the lock return could be invariant; otherwise it likely varies at runtime.\n\n- NDEBUG or build/config macros that enable/disable LFS_ASSERT: Many assert-style macros are removed or replaced depending on build flags. Knowing which config macros are active determines whether the LFS_ASSERT controlling expression is present in the effective code being analyzed.\n\nNote: lfs_mlist_isopen and lfs_file_close_ are already present in the static call graph; include their definitions when practical, but the additional symbols above are the ones required to determine whether any controlling expressions in this function are invariant under the build/config used."
