  "explanation": "No direct calls to the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear elsewhere in this function. The remaining code consists of the function signature, a local variable declaration, simple control flow/return statements, and the lines included above. The macro/function invocations and the call to lfs_fs_traverse_ have been listed because their definitions/implementations are not visible here and could potentially use string.h routines; therefore they should be investigated. All other fragments in this snippet do not perform string handling and need not be investigated for Rule 21.17."
