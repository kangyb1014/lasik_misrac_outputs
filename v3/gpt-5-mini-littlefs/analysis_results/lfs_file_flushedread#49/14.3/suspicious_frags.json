  "explanation": "I report all loop controlling expressions from the provided code that merit inspection under MISRA C: Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). These are the while-loop headers present in the supplied functions. Other conditional expressions (if-statements, compound boolean tests) are not reported because they depend on function parameters, structure members, or local variables that are modified either in the surrounding code or by called functions, so they are not compile-time or obviously invariant across iterations. No explicit do-while or constant literal controlling expressions (e.g. while(1) or do { } while (0) ) appear in the provided source fragments; therefore no additional fragments were marked. If macro expansions (such as LFS_ASSERT) introduce do-while constructs, their definitions would need to be inspected separately, but their expansions are not present in the supplied code and thus are not listed here."
