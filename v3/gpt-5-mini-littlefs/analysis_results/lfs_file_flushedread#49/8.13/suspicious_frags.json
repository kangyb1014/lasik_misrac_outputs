  "explanation": "The remaining pointer usages do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they clearly require non-const targets in this function: - The file parameter (file) is modified (file->pos, file->off, file->block, file->flags are updated), so it cannot be const-qualified. - The buffer parameter is used as the destination for reads (data is written into), so it must be a non-const pointer. - Member accesses and integer fields (file->pos, file->off, file->block, file->flags, lfs->cfg->block_size) are either scalar values or are explicitly modified here, so they do not indicate a missing const qualification. - NULL arguments and tag/value constants are not pointer-to-object declarations and are not subject to this rule. The listed fragments are the parts that warrant further inspection to determine whether the pointers passed/used could (or should) point to const-qualified types per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
