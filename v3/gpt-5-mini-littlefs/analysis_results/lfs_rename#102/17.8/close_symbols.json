  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or function invoked directly in lfs_rename. If it is a macro, its expansion is part of lfs_rename and could (in principle) contain assignments that modify the function parameters (for example via unintended token usage). To verify the MISRA rule you must see its definition/expansion. \n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/executable body is present in lfs_rename and must be inspected to ensure it does not assign to the parameter variables (lfs, oldpath, newpath).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro/function is called with the parameters. If LFS_TRACE is a macro, its expansion could contain expressions that rebind or assign to the parameter identifiers. You need its definition to confirm it does not modify the function parameters.\n\n- lfs_rename_: Although a callee cannot reassign the caller's local parameter variables directly, include the definition of lfs_rename_ for completeness: if lfs_rename used (or forwarded) addresses of its parameter variables via macro expansions or passed pointers-to-parameters (not present here, but worth checking), or if the intention is to analyze the overall rename flow, knowing the callee implementation helps ensure no aliasing/tricky macro does indirect assignment. At minimum, this lets you confirm that no code in the caller (via inlined/expanded calls) assigns to the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): You need the definition of the lfs_t type to understand how lfs->cfg is formed and whether any macro or function could be using a parameter identifier that shadows/assigns the lfs parameter.\n\n- lfs->cfg / lfs_cfg (configuration type): Because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg, inspect the cfg type and related macros to ensure none of those macros perform operations that would reassign the lfs parameter identifier (for example by macro tricks or by taking addresses of local variables).\n\nThese symbols together let the analyzer see all code that is textually or semantically part of lfs_rename (macro expansions and direct callees) so you can determine whether any assignment to the function parameters (the pointer variables lfs, oldpath, or newpath) occurs, which would violate the MISRA rule."
