  "explanation": "I found no uses of the string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided code fragments. The functions shown (lfs_setattr, lfs_setattr_, lfs_commitattr) only pass pointers and sizes through and perform a bounds check (size > lfs->attr_max) in lfs_setattr_. The LFS_TRACE macro uses a \"%s\" format specifier, but that is for formatted I/O (stdio) and is not a <string.h> function covered by Rule 21.17. The provided macros LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are no-ops and the struct definitions do not call any string.h routines either. Note: helper functions referenced but not shown (for example lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_fetch, or the definition of LFS_MKATTRS) could potentially use string.h functions internally; those bodies were not provided, so they cannot be flagged here. If you want a full Rule 21.17 assessment, please provide the implementations of those referenced functions/macros so they can be inspected for string.h usage and potential out-of-bounds access."
