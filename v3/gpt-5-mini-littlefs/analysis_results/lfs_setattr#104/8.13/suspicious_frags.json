  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not present potential const-qualification issues for Rule 8.13: the function parameters 'path' and 'buffer' are already const-qualified in the visible signatures, scalar parameters (type, size) are non-pointer and not applicable, local non-pointer variables (e.g. tag, id) are not subject to this rule, and logging uses (e.g. LFS_TRACE) only read from pointers without altering const qualification. The listed fragments are where a pointer's const-qualification may be lost or where pointers are passed to APIs/macros that might accept non-const targets and therefore warrant investigation."
