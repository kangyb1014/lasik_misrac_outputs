  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_setattr violates the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible we must know whether any of the pointer parameters or the lfs pointer are actually modified or passed to non-const APIs. Concretely:\n\n- lfs_setattr_: need its prototype/definition to see the parameter types it declares (e.g. whether it accepts const void *buffer, const char *path, or non-const pointers). If lfs_setattr_ expects non-const pointers, then lfs_setattr may be discarding const qualifiers or passing const to a non-const parameter (a const-qualifier issue).\n\n- lfs_commitattr: lfs_setattr_ calls this. Its definition/prototype is required to determine whether data referred to by buffer/path (or lfs) is written to deeper in the call chain. If commitattr (or other callees) modify the pointed-to data, the pointer should not be const; otherwise it should be const.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): to determine whether the lfs pointer itself could/should be const-qualified. If lfs_setattr or its callees modify members of *lfs, then lfs cannot be const. We need the struct definition to see what members are accessed/modified.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (the configuration type / typedef inside lfs_t): LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) are invoked; the parameter type (and whether the lock API expects a non-const pointer) affects whether lfs->cfg \u2014 and by extension lfs \u2014 can be const.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions): these determine whether calling them requires a non-const argument (they may modify the cfg or take a non-const pointer). If they require non-const, lfs cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): the trace macro is called with (void*)lfs and other parameters. Some trace implementations may cast away const or require non-const arguments; its definition shows whether passing a const lfs pointer would be allowed without discarding const qualifiers.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyzer see whether any pointer passed into or used by lfs_setattr is actually modified or passed to non-const APIs (in which case it must be non-const), or whether it could and should be declared const (MISRA recommendation)."
