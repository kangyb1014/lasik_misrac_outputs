  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression if (err) is invariant you must know how err is produced. err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), so you need the exact definition/expansion of LFS_LOCK to see whether it can produce variable results at runtime or whether it is compiled to a constant (in which case the controlling expression would be invariant). To understand how LFS_LOCK operates you also need the lfs_t layout (to see what lfs->cfg actually is) and the definition of the cfg type (typically a struct that contains lock/unlock callback pointers). The lock callback prototype and documented semantics (what return values mean, and whether it can be NULL or replaced) determine whether LFS_LOCK can return differing values; similarly, any compile-time configuration macros that replace or disable locking can make LFS_LOCK a constant expression. Finally, the concrete definitions/meanings of the error/return codes (notably 0 == success vs non-zero) are required to evaluate whether the if (err) test is checking a meaningful, variable condition or a compile-time constant. LFS_UNLOCK is included for completeness since it is paired with LFS_LOCK and its definition may share the same compile-time substitutions."
