  "explanation": "No memcmp usage is present in the provided code fragments. The functions shown (lfs_setattr, lfs_setattr_, lfs_commitattr) do not call memcmp nor perform direct string comparisons of null-terminated strings; they forward path, buffer, and size to other functions (lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit) and use LFS_TRACE for logging. Therefore there are no code locations in the supplied snippets that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used in other parts of the codebase not shown here, those locations would need to be checked separately.)"
