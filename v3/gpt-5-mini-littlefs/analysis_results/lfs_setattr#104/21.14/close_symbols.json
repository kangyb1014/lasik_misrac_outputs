  "explanation": "- lfs_setattr_: the direct callee of lfs_setattr; its implementation must be inspected for any string comparisons or calls to memcmp (or other string routines) that would trigger the MISRA rule.\n- lfs_commitattr: called by lfs_setattr_; may perform attribute/filename comparisons and could contain memcmp usage on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule; you must check whether this function is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in the callees.\n- strcmp / strncmp / strnlen: common string-handling alternatives or related routines; include them so the analyzer can see whether proper string routines are used instead of memcmp or whether these functions are themselves used incorrectly. These symbols cover the likely places where a violation (memcmp on NUL-terminated strings) would occur in the call chain."
