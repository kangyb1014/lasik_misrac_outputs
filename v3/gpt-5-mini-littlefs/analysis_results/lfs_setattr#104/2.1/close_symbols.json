  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is called at the top of lfs_setattr and its result controls an early return (if (err) return err;). If LFS_LOCK contains non\u2011local control flow (e.g. longjmp, abort, exit, or a macro that returns/gotos out), it can make the subsequent if/return or later code unreachable. Must inspect its definition to determine reachability.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called unconditionally just before returning from lfs_setattr. If LFS_UNLOCK performs non\u2011local control flow (or expands to nothing under some build options), it affects whether the final return is reachable and whether code following the call in other build variants could be unreachable.  \n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro can expand to nothing or to code that affects control flow (for example, a debug macro that returns on error). Its expansion can influence reachability of surrounding statements (the trace before the final unlock/return and the trace after calling lfs_setattr_).  \n- lfs_setattr_: The internal function called by lfs_setattr. If lfs_setattr_ never returns (calls exit/longjmp/loop/abort) then the LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr -> %d\"), LFS_UNLOCK, and final return would be unreachable. You must inspect its body.  \n- lfs_commitattr: lfs_setattr_ calls lfs_commitattr (per static call graph). Any non\u2011local control flow in lfs_commitattr (or in functions it calls) can propagate up and make code after the call chain in lfs_setattr unreachable; therefore its definition is needed for full reachability analysis.  \n- lfs_t: The structure/type definition (in particular the cfg member) is required to understand how LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are implemented (they operate on lfs->cfg). The type/field definitions can affect macro expansions or conditional compilation that change control flow and thus reachability.  \n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether any statements inside lfs_setattr can be proven unreachable under the project\u2019s actual definitions/expansions."
