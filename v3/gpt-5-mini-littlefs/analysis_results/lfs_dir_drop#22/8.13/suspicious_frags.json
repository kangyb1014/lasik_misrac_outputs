  "explanation": "Other lines in the function do not introduce additional pointer usage that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The remaining fragments are control-flow and error checks (if (err) { ... }, return err;, return 0;), or simple local variable declarations (int err) and comments, none of which declare or pass pointer types. The provided additional code (uint8_t type) is not a pointer declaration and is not used in the shown function. Therefore, all occurrences in this function where pointer types or pointer-valued expressions appear have been included above for investigation; other fragments do not need to be investigated under Rule 8.13."
