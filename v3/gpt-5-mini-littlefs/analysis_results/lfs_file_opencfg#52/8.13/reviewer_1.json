This discards the const qualifier from the pointer-to-attrs and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible). A compliant fix is to preserve the const qualification, e.g. cast to (const void*)cfg->attrs and adjust the LFS_TRACE prototype/usage to accept/display const void * if needed.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns the use of const qualification in pointer declarations (i.e. a pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type where possible). The problematic text in the code is a cast in an expression ((void*)cfg->attrs) that removes const qualification; this is an expression/cast issue (discarding const) rather than a pointer-declaration issue covered by 8.13. \n\nThat said, the code does discard const via the (void*) cast on cfg and cfg->attrs. Discarding const qualification by cast may be covered by a different MISRA rule addressing qualification-preserving conversions or forbidding discarding const via casts, so a different rule (not 8.13) would be the appropriate target. A compliant change here would be to preserve const in the cast (e.g. (const void*)cfg->attrs) and adapt LFS_TRACE to accept/display const void * if necessary."
