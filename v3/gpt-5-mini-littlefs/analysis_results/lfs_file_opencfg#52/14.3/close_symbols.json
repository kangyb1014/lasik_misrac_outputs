  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to assess MISRA C rule about invariant controlling expressions:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - The first controlling expression is if (err) after err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must see the definition/implementation of LFS_LOCK (macro or function) to know whether it can return different runtime values or is an invariant (e.g. expands to a constant). If LFS_LOCK is a macro that always yields 0 (or a compile-time constant) then the controlling test would be invariant.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  - Even though not directly in a controlling expression, LFS_UNLOCK pairs with LFS_LOCK and its definition can indicate whether locking functions are no-ops in some builds (affecting whether LFS_LOCK is invariant). Also relevant to determining whether lock operations are compiled out by configuration macros.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT\n  - The code uses LFS_ASSERT(!lfs_mlist_isopen(...)). LFS_ASSERT is likely a macro that may compile to nothing or to an expression-evaluating check. You need its definition to know whether the asserted controlling expression is actually evaluated at runtime (and thus non-invariant) or removed, and whether the macro itself introduces any controlling expressions that could be invariant.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen\n  - The expression inside the assert is !lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file). You must inspect lfs_mlist_isopen's prototype/implementation to determine whether its result can vary at runtime (depends on lfs->mlist and file) or is effectively constant for the call sites (making the controlling expression invariant).\n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including members cfg and mlist)\n  - You must know the types and qualifiers (e.g. volatile, const) of the fields used in controlling expressions: lfs->cfg (passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK) and lfs->mlist (passed to lfs_mlist_isopen). If these members are typed/qualified such that their values are constant/compile-time-known (or if configuration makes them stubbed), the controlling expressions may be invariant.\n\n- lfs_file_t / struct lfs_mlist (type definition)\n  - lfs_mlist_isopen is called with a casted file pointer. Knowing the target type/structure and any qualifiers on file helps determine whether the argument is variable or effectively constant (e.g. statically allocated or always NULL), which affects whether the controlling expression can vary.\n\n- struct lfs_file_config (definition: buffer, attrs, attr_count)\n  - The function prints cfg members and passes cfg to lfs_file_opencfg_. While not directly part of a controlling expression here, the cfg pointer and its qualifiers may be involved in macro expansions (e.g. LFS_LOCK/LFS_ASSERT implementations that inspect cfg) and are needed to fully understand whether expressions using cfg (or macros that use cfg) are invariant.\n\nNotes:\n- LFS_TRACE was omitted because it only logs and does not affect control flow in this function's conditionals; include it only if its definition contains control constructs that evaluate/influence the same expressions.\n- lfs_file_opencfg_ and other callees are not required to decide if the controlling expressions present in this wrapper (if (err) and the assert) are invariant, because those expressions are evaluated before the call. Include them only if you need a broader interprocedural analysis."
