Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_seek_:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_dir_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir, lfs_off_t off) {\n    // simply walk from head dir\n    int err = lfs_dir_rewind_(lfs, dir);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // first two for ./..\n    dir->pos = lfs_min(2, off);\n    off -= dir->pos;\n\n    // skip superblock entry\n    dir->id = (off > 0 && lfs_pair_cmp(dir->head, lfs->root) == 0);\n\n    while (off > 0) {\n        if (dir->id == dir->m.count) {\n            if (!dir->m.split) {\n                return LFS_ERR_INVAL;\n            }\n\n            err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &dir->m, dir->m.tail);\n            if (err) {\n                return err;\n            }\n\n            dir->id = 0;\n        }\n\n        int diff = lfs_min(dir->m.count - dir->id, off);\n        dir->id += diff;\n        dir->pos += diff;\n        off -= diff;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_seek_:\ntypedef uint32_t lfs_off_t\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndir->pos = lfs_min(2, off);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment sets the initial directory position to min(2, off) to account for the './' and '../' entries and immediately adjusts off (off -= dir->pos). dir->pos is then used/updated later in the loop. Removing this statement would change off and dir->pos and thus program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
