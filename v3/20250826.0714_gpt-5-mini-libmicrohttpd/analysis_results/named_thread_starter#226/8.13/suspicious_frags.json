  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not introduce pointer objects that could reasonably be const-qualified for the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, so they need not be investigated: the NULL check (if (NULL == data) ...) is only a runtime guard, the call to MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ (param->name) is a use of a field already covered by the flagged param access, and the literal return of (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0 is not related to pointer qualification. The selected fragments include all declarations, assignments and uses of pointer-typed objects in the function; other lines are simple control flow or non-pointer expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
