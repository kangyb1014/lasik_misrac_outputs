  "explanation": "I added minimal typedefs and a struct definition so the compiler knows the shapes used by the function (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_, MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_, and struct MHD_named_helper_param_). I also removed the undefined call-convention token (MHD_THRD_CALL_SPEC_) from the function signature and used a plain, valid C declaration instead. I declared MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ as an extern function (no mock implementation) to preserve original behavior while allowing compilation. The rest of the original logic in named_thread_starter and the logging helper is left intact."
