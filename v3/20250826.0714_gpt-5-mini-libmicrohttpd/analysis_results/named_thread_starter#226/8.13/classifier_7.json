  "scenario": "The pointer 'data' is passed to free(). Because free() requires a void * (non-const) the pointer cannot be const-qualified without later casting away const. Here 'param' is a non-const pointer derived from 'data' and is only used to read fields and then free the allocation. This is not a violation. A violation would occur if a pointer that is never used to modify or deallocate the pointee were declared non-const when it could have been declared pointing to a const-qualified type (or if const was cast away to call free), e.g. declaring 'struct S *p' when it could be 'const struct S *p' and then mutating through p or removing const via a cast."
