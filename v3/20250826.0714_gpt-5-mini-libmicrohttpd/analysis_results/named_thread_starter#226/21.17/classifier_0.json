  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment only casts a void pointer to a pointer-to-struct and does not call any <string.h> functions or perform buffer accesses. The cast itself does not access object contents or bounds. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated by this fragment. (Note: if later code used a string function like strcpy on a member of the struct without ensuring sufficient buffer size, that could violate the rule, but that is outside this fragment.)"
