  "explanation": "No function parameters are declared or used in the get_num_threads function, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated here. The function has no pointer parameters, and the called helpers get_cpu_core_count() and get_process_cpu_core_count() are invoked with no arguments, so there are no parameter modifications to inspect. Assignments in this function modify either a global variable (num_threads) or local variables (num_proc_cpus), which are outside the scope of Rule 17.8. The disabled code blocks only declare/assign a local const and compare/assign a variable; they do not modify function parameters. Therefore, there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
