  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The rule concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that can access beyond object bounds. The provided function contains no calls to any of these string.h functions or other buffer-manipulating functions: it only uses integer variables, calls get_cpu_core_count(), get_process_cpu_core_count(), and printf with compile-time string literals (adjacent string literals are concatenated at compile time and do not involve runtime buffer operations). The disabled (#if 0) blocks likewise contain no string.h usage. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that could violate Rule 21.17 and nothing to report for investigation."
