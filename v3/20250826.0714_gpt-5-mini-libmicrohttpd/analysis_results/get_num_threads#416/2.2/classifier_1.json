The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_num_threads:\n```c\nstatic unsigned int\nget_num_threads (void)\n{\n#if 0  /* disalbed code */\n  static const unsigned int max_threads = 32;\n#endif /* disalbed code */\n  if (0 < num_threads)\n    return num_threads;\n\n  num_threads = get_cpu_core_count () / 2;\n  if (0 == num_threads)\n    num_threads = 1;\n  else\n  {\n    unsigned int num_proc_cpus;\n    num_proc_cpus = get_process_cpu_core_count ();\n    if (num_proc_cpus >= num_threads)\n    {\n      printf (\"Using half of all available CPU cores, assuming the other half \"\n              \"is used by client / requests generator.\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      printf (\"Using all CPU cores available for this process as more than \"\n              \"half of CPU cores on this system are still available for use \"\n              \"by client / requests generator.\\n\");\n      num_threads = num_proc_cpus;\n    }\n  }\n#if 0  /* disalbed code */\n  if (max_threads < num_threads)\n  {\n    printf (\"Number of threads are limited to %u as more threads \"\n            \"are unlikely to improve the performance.\\n\", max_threads);\n    num_threads = max_threads;\n  }\n#endif /* disalbed code */\n\n  return num_threads;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if 0  /* disalbed code */\n  static const unsigned int max_threads = 32;\n#endif /* disalbed code */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the fragment is excluded by the preprocessor (#if 0) so it is not part of the translation unit and cannot be executed. MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; preprocessor-disabled code is not executed and therefore not dead code. (If the declaration were compiled but unused/its execution had no effect, that compiled unused code could violate Rule 2.2.)"
