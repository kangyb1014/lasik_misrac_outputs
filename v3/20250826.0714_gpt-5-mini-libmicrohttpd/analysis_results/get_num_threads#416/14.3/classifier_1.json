  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a preprocessor conditional (#if 0) that disables code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 applies to C controlling expressions (if/for/while/do-while/switch), not to preprocessor conditionals. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 14.3. (Note: had the code used an invariant C controlling expression such as if (0) or while (1) in C source, that could violate Rule 14.3 unless covered by an allowed exception.)"
