This disabled code is therefore unreachable and constitutes a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. Text inside a #if 0 / #endif is removed by the preprocessor and does not form part of the translation unit or the compiled program, so it is not \"unreachable code\" in the sense intended by MISRA C: Rule 2.1 prohibits code that is present in the compiled program but cannot be executed at run time. The disabled declaration and the disabled block are never compiled, therefore they are not subject to Rule 2.1. (If those blocks were compiled but could never be executed, that would be a Rule 2.1 issue; as given they are simply excluded by the preprocessor.)"
