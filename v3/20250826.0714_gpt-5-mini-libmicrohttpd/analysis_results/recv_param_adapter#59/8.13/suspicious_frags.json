  "explanation": "No pointer parameters or local pointer objects in this function can reasonably be made const. The function takes two pointer parameters: 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' and 'void *other'. 'connection' is potentially modified (connection->epoll_state is cleared under EPOLL_SUPPORT), so it cannot be const. 'other' is passed to MHD_recv_ as the destination buffer for received data and therefore must be a non-const void* so that the receive operation can write into it. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions in this function that could be const-qualified. Consequently, there are no code fragments here that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
