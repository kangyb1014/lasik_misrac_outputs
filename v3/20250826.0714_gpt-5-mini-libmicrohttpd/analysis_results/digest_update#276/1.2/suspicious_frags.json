  "explanation": "I report only the fragments that may indicate use of compiler-specific language extensions or implementation-reserved identifiers that often hide compiler-specific keywords/macros. The function storage-class/inline specifier macro (_MHD_static_inline) must be investigated because it commonly maps to compiler-specific inline/__inline__/__forceinline or attributes in compiler documentation; that would be a language extension if used. The use of the identifier-like macro _DEBUG (leading underscore) should be checked because such implementation-reserved macros are often provided by specific toolchains and can enable compiler-specific behavior. Other parts of the code do not show obvious compiler language extensions: casts to (const uint8_t *), use of size_t, standard struct/pointer usage, conditional compilation using MHD_MD5_SUPPORT / MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT / MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT, calls to MHD_*_update, and mhd_assert usage are normal C constructs or project-defined macros and are not by themselves explicit compiler language extensions per compiler documentation."
