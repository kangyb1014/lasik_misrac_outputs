The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_update:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ndigest_update (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n               const void *data,\n               size_t length)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n  mhd_assert (da->ready_for_hashing);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    MHD_MD5_update (&da->ctx.md5_ctx, (const uint8_t *) data, length);\n  else\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    MHD_SHA256_update (&da->ctx.sha256_ctx, (const uint8_t *) data, length);\n  else\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    MHD_SHA512_256_update (&da->ctx.sha512_256_ctx,\n                           (const uint8_t *) data, length);\n  else\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0);   /* May not happen */\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  da->hashing = true;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  da->hashing = true;\n#endif\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
