  "explanation": "I found no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons: \n\n- Parameter \"const void *data\": already const-qualified; the code casts it to (const uint8_t *) when calling the update functions, preserving const qualification. No non-const pointer to the input data is created.\n\n- Parameter \"struct DigestAlgorithm *da\": this pointer refers to the algorithm state which is intentionally modified (e.g. da->hashing = true), so it cannot be const-qualified. Therefore a non-const pointer is appropriate and does not violate the rule.\n\n- Passing &da->ctx.md5_ctx, &da->ctx.sha256_ctx, &da->ctx.sha512_256_ctx to the respective update functions yields non-const pointers to context objects that are expected to be modified by those update functions. Making those pointers point to const would be incorrect.\n\n- The mhd_assert() uses and the mhd_assert(0) trap do not introduce pointer-qualification issues relevant to Rule 8.13.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer declarations or uses in this function that should be converted to point to const-qualified types, so no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13."
