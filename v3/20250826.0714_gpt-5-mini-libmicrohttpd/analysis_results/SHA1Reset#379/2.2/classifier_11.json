The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Reset:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Reset (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (! context)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  context->length_low = 0;\n  context->length_high = 0;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] = 0x67452301;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] = 0xEFCDAB89;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] = 0x98BADCFE;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] = 0x10325476;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] = 0xC3D2E1F0;\n  context->computed = 0;\n  context->corrupted = 0;\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontext->length_low = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment context->length_low = 0; is part of SHA1Reset initialization of the SHA1Context. Removing it would change program behaviour because length_low tracks the processed message length and will be read/used later by the SHA-1 implementation. Note also MISRA Note 3: initialization is not the same as an assignment candidate for dead code; here the assignment is an intended initialization. (If, hypothetically, length_low were never read before being overwritten elsewhere, then that assignment would be dead code.)"
