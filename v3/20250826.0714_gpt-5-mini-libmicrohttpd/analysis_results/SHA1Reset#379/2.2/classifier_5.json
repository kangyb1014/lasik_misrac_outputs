  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Reset:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Reset (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (! context)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  context->length_low = 0;\n  context->length_high = 0;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] = 0x67452301;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] = 0xEFCDAB89;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] = 0x98BADCFE;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] = 0x10325476;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] = 0xC3D2E1F0;\n  context->computed = 0;\n  context->corrupted = 0;\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final return statement returns a meaningful result (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS) to the caller. It is executed in the normal flow and removing it would change program behaviour (the function would fall off the end of a non-void function, leading to undefined behaviour). Therefore this statement is not dead code."
