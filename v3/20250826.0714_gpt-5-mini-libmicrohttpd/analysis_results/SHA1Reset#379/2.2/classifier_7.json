  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Reset:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Reset (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (! context)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  context->length_low = 0;\n  context->length_high = 0;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] = 0x67452301;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] = 0xEFCDAB89;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] = 0x98BADCFE;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] = 0x10325476;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] = 0xC3D2E1F0;\n  context->computed = 0;\n  context->corrupted = 0;\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontext->length_high = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the assignment initializes the high 32 bits of the 64-bit message length in the SHA1Context. Removing it could change program behaviour when the message length accumulates (overflow of length_low into length_high) or when other code reads length_high, so the operation is not dead code. (Note: it would only be dead if, for the whole project, the length_high member is never read and no overflow handling ever uses it \u2014 in that specific project configuration the assignment could be removed without effect.)"
