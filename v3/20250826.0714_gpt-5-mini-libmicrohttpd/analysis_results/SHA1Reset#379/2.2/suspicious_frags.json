Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other text in the snippet consists of the function signature, braces and whitespace which are syntactic only and cannot themselves represent executed operations subject to dead-code classification. The listed fragments are the executed statements (null-check, assignments to context fields, and return statements) that should be investigated to determine whether any of these executed operations could be removed without changing program behaviour (i.e. might be dead). No other executable statements exist in this function."
