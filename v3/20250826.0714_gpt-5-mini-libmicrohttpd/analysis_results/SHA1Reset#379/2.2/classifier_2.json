  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Reset:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Reset (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (! context)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  context->length_low = 0;\n  context->length_high = 0;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] = 0x67452301;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] = 0xEFCDAB89;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] = 0x98BADCFE;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] = 0x10325476;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] = 0xC3D2E1F0;\n  context->computed = 0;\n  context->corrupted = 0;\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontext->corrupted = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "In the shown function the assignment context->corrupted = 0 is an initialization of the SHA1Context state and therefore affects subsequent behaviour (e.g. other SHA1 functions are expected to test the corrupted flag). According to MISRA C 2023 Note 3, initialization/initialising assignments are not candidates for dead code \u2014 so as shown this is not dead code. \n\n(Contrasting violation scenario: if, in the whole project, the corrupted member is never read or used \u2014 i.e. no function ever inspects context->corrupted and it is always overwritten before any read \u2014 then this assignment would be removable without changing behaviour and would violate Rule 2.2.)"
