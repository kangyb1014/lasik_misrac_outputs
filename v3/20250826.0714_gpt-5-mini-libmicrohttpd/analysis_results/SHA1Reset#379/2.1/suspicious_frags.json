  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in this function. Reasoning: the only conditional is the null check (if (! context)) that returns immediately when context is NULL; that return is reachable when callers pass NULL. For non-NULL context, execution continues and all subsequent assignment statements and the final return are reachable. There are no other branches, labels, gotos, infinite loops, or code following an unconditional return that would create dead/unreachable code. Therefore no fragments in this function need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
