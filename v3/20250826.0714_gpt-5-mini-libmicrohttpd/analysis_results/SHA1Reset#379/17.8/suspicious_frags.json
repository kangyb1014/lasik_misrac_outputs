  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modification of a function parameter itself; it permits modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In this function: - The null check 'if (! context)' only reads the pointer and does not modify it. - All assignments are to members of the object pointed to by 'context' (e.g., 'context->length_low = 0;'), which is allowed by the rule. - There is no reassignment of the parameter identifier 'context' (no 'context = ...', no increments/decrements of the pointer). Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
