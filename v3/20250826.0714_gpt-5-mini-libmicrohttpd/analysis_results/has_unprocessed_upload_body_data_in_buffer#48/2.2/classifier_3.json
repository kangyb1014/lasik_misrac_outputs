  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer:\n```c\nstatic bool\nhas_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  if (! c->rq.have_chunked_upload)\n    return 0 != c->read_buffer_offset;\n\n  /* Chunked upload */\n  mhd_assert (0 != c->rq.remaining_upload_size); /* Must not be possible in MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING state */\n  if (c->rq.current_chunk_offset == c->rq.current_chunk_size)\n  {\n    /* 0 == c->rq.current_chunk_size: Waiting the chunk size (chunk header).\n       0 != c->rq.current_chunk_size: Waiting for chunk-closing CRLF. */\n    return false;\n  }\n  return 0 != c->read_buffer_offset; /* Chunk payload data in the read buffer */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The mhd_assert enforces an invariant (that c->state == MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING). It is an executable runtime check whose removal would change program behaviour in the case the condition is false (e.g. it may abort or log the failure). Therefore this statement is not dead code and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
