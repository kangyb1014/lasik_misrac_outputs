  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls). Reasoning:\n- The function body contains no call to has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, so there is no direct recursion.\n- The only function-like invocation is mhd_assert. Typically this is a macro (or at worst an assertion helper) and there is no evidence in this fragment that it would call back into has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer; it should be inspected separately only if its definition is unavailable, but from this fragment alone it does not create an indirect recursion concern.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences, callbacks, or other function calls (no calls via struct members) in this code that could form an indirect recursive cycle.\n- The code only reads structure members, performs comparisons, and returns boolean values; these operations cannot cause recursion.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments within the provided function that require further investigation for Rule 17.2. If desired, reviewers can separately verify the definition/expansion of mhd_assert to confirm it does not lead to any indirect call to this function."
