  "explanation": "I selected all calls within parse_cookie_header that could potentially lead to indirect recursion (i.e., calls into other functions that might, directly or indirectly, call back into parse_cookie_header). These include external library/utility functions that operate on the connection or may invoke callbacks: MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, parse_cookies_string, the logging macro/function MHD_DLOG (multiple occurrences), and the assertion mhd_assert. memcpy is also included as a call into another routine. Other fragments in the function (local variable declarations and initializations, simple control flow constructs such as the initial whitespace-skipping while loop, switch/case handling, assignments to saved_tail/headers_received_tail, and return statements) are purely local operations or straightforward control flow and do not invoke external functions or callbacks, so they cannot by themselves create direct or indirect recursion and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. Likewise, simple macro expansions (e.g. MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) used only as compile-time constants are not recursive sources and were not listed separately."
