  "explanation": "I reviewed the function for use of known compiler/language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples checked: identifiers with leading double underscores or reserved compiler names, GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __asm__ tokens, typeof/__typeof__, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, builtin extension operators, asm labels, GNU compound literals used as expressions, trailing comma in macro-only contexts that are extensions, and other vendor-specific tokens). The code uses only standard C constructs visible here: function-level static, pointer and const qualifiers, casts (size_t), standard integer types (uint64_t, size_t), bool (from C99/C11 stdbool.h), preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef), and standard library calls (memcpy). No __attribute__, __asm__, __typeof__, statement-expressions, nested functions, or other compiler-specific extensions appear in the provided snippet. Note: macros called here (mhd_assert, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, calculate_nonce, etc.) could potentially expand to extension usage, but those expansions are not present in the shown code; per the rule you requested, I flagged only explicit language/compiler extensions present in the provided code fragment \u2014 none were found."
