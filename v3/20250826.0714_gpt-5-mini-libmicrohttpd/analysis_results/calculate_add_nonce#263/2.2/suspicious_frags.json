  "explanation": "Other code fragments were not marked because they perform essential computations or invoke functions whose removal would change program behaviour and therefore are unlikely to be dead code. Examples: retrieving the daemon pointer (MHD_get_master), computing nonce_size (NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_get_size(da))), the call to calculate_nonce (which computes the nonce contents used later), the index computation using get_nonce_nc_idx and the selection of the nn slot, the is_slot_available test and the subsequent setting of the return value \u2014 these operations clearly affect control flow or data used by the system. The conditional digest_ext_error block is guarded by a preprocessor macro and, when present, directly affects the returned result. These operations must be investigated in-context but are not prima facie dead code, so they were not included in the suspicious list."
