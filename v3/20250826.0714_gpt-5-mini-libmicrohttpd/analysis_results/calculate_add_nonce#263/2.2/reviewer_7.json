If assertions are enabled it executes but cannot change behaviour (it only confirms an invariant), and if assertions are compiled out it has no effect. Thus the operation is executed (in debug builds) but its removal would not affect program behaviour, constituting dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert(0 != nonce_size) is a runtime invariant check that can affect program behaviour when enabled (it may abort or otherwise signal a failure) and can affect timing. MISRA R2.2 forbids code whose removal would not affect behaviour; here the assertion can affect behaviour in builds where assertions are enabled or if the invariant were ever violated, so it is not dead code. Even if the developer believes nonce_size is always > 0, that must be proven for the whole project to classify the assertion as removable without effect; absent such a proof the assertion cannot be considered dead. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim is incorrect."
