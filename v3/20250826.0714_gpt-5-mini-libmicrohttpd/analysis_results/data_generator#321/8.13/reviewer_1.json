True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'void *cls' is not const-qualified even though it is unused and not modified in the function; to conform to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared as 'const void *cls' when possible. Note: 'char *buf' is correctly non-const because the function writes to the buffer. If this prototype must match an external API that requires 'void *', then const-qualification may not be possible and the rule would not apply.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is plausible but not definitively a violation given the information available. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, and in this isolated snippet the parameter cls is unused and not modified, so declaring it as const void *cls would satisfy the rule.\n\nHowever, whether the current code actually violates the rule depends on context that is not provided. If this function must match an externally mandated prototype (for example a callback type declared by a library or API that requires void *cls), then the non-const signature is required and the rule cannot be applied; that is an acceptable justification/exemption. If the function is purely internal (it is static here) and not constrained by an external API, then the parameter could and should be declared const void *cls to conform to Rule 8.13.\n\nThus Agent A\u2019s claim is potentially correct, but not deterministically so from the snippet alone. Recommended actions: if there is no external prototype constraint, change the parameter to const void *cls; otherwise document the external constraint as a justification for not applying the const qualification."
