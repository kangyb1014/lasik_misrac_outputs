  "explanation": "No usage of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the supplied code. The only C library function used is memset (used to fill the buffer), and there are no comparisons of null-terminated strings (no memcmp calls, no strcmp/strncmp calls). Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The other lines (casting unused parameters to void, buf[79] = '\\n', return 80) do not involve memcmp or string comparison and so are not relevant to this rule."
