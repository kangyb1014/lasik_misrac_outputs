  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected in the provided function. Reasoning: the two (void) cast lines are intentional used-to-suppress-unused-parameter warnings and are executed (not dead). The conditional if (max < 80) return 0; is a conditional return; the code that follows (memset, buf[79] = '\\n'; return 80;) is reachable whenever the condition is false (i.e. max >= 80). There are no statements after an unconditional transfer of control (no code after a guaranteed return, break, continue, goto, or infinite loop), no constant conditions that make branches impossible, and no dead labelled blocks. The indexed write buf[79] is guarded by the max >= 80 condition, so it is reachable and not undefined by being out-of-range. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
