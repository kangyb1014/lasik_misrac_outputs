  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the code. The only uses of parameters are: (void) cls; and (void) pos; (these cast to void to suppress unused warnings and do not modify the parameters), passing buf to memset and indexing buf[79] (both modify the object pointed to by buf, which is permitted by the rule), and reading max/pos/cls (no modification). There is no assignment to any parameter variable (no reassignments like buf = ..., cls = ..., pos = ..., max = ...), so Rule 17.8 is not violated and no code fragments require further investigation under this rule."
