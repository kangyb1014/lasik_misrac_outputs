  "explanation": "Only code that can participate in indirect recursion are function calls or constructs that expand to function calls. In this function body the only explicit function call expressions are the three fprintf calls and the return expression (which could involve macros/expansions). Other fragments in the function are simple conditional checks, scalar assignments (tool_params.medium = ! 0;), and array indexing (param_name[1]) which do not invoke functions themselves. Therefore only the listed fragments need investigation for possible direct/indirect recursion; the remaining statements do not call functions and cannot cause Rule 17.2 violations."
