  "explanation": "No calls to any of the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. Therefore there are no fragments invoking the Standard Library string functions that could result in accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by their pointer parameters and nothing to flag under Rule 21.17.\n\nNotes for reviewers (not as Rule 21.17 findings): the code does dereference param_name via param_name[1] and passes param_name to fprintf with \"%s\". Those uses are ordinary pointer/IO operations and are not calls to functions from <string.h>, so they are outside the strict scope of Rule 21.17. If you want to check for potential out-of-bounds or non-null-terminated strings generally, verify the callers ensure param_name points to a valid, null-terminated buffer of sufficient length (at least 2 characters when indexing param_name[1]). That is a different safety concern and would be handled by other MISRA rules or additional checks."
