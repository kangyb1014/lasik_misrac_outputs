  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__medium:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__medium (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.tiny)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-T' or '--tiny'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.large)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-L' or '--large'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.medium = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (tool_params.large)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-L' or '--large'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "This branch is executed when tool_params.large is true: it prints an error and returns PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, preventing the function from setting medium. Removing it would change program behaviour (different diagnostics and return value) unless tool_params.large can never be true (no evidence of that here). Therefore it is not dead code."
