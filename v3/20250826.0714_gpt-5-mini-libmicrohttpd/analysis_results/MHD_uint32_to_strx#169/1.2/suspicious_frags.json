  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: uint32_t and size_t (standard typedefs from <stdint.h>/<stddef.h>), integer shifts, casts, do/while and while loops, the conditional (?:) operator, and ordinary comments. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as identifiers or keywords beginning with __, __attribute__ or attribute((...)), asm statements, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... ; }) used as expressions, nested functions, binary literals (0b...), inline assembly, pragma extensions, or other documented compiler-specific extensions. The /**< and @a sequences are documentation (Doxygen-style) comment contents and are not language extensions. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
