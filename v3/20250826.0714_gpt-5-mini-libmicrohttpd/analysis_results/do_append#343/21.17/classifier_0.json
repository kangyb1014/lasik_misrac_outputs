  "scenario": "Under normal, well-formed use this fragment is safe: old_len is computed as strlen(*ret), the destination buffer is allocated with at least old_len bytes, and memcpy copies exactly old_len bytes. Therefore the code does not itself violate Rule 21.17. A possible violation scenario (hypothetical) is if *ret does not point to a null-terminated object (or points to an object smaller than the string length returned by strlen due to corruption); then strlen may have already read beyond the source object and memcpy(buf, *ret, old_len) would read beyond the bounds of *ret, violating the rule."
