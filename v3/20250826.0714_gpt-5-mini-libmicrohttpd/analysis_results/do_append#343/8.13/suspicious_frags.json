  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the parameter 'data' is already const-qualified (const char *), so it complies; size_t variables (size, old_len) are non-pointer types and not relevant; the malloc call returns a mutable buffer that is subsequently written to (buf is used as a modifiable destination and assigned to via buf[old_len + size] = '\\0'), so making it point to a const-qualified type would be incorrect; calls to memcpy and the null-termination on buf indicate the buffer must be modifiable. The remaining statements (strlen, malloc, the final return) either do not involve pointer target qualification choices or already respect const qualification."
