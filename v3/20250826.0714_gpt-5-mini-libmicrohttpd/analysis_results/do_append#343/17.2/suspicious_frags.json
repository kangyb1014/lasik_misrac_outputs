  "explanation": "I examined the entire do_append function body and found no direct or indirect calls to itself. The function calls only standard library functions (strlen, malloc, memcpy, free) and uses no function pointers, callbacks, or other user-defined functions that could re-enter do_append. The parameters are char ** and const char *, not function pointers, so there is no mechanism in this code fragment for an indirect recursive call. Therefore there are no code fragments within this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. (Note: recursion involving do_append via other functions in other translation units is outside the scope of this single-function fragment.)"
