The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncheck_and_grow_read_buffer_space (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  /**\n   * The increase of read buffer size is desirable.\n   */\n  bool rbuff_grow_desired;\n  /**\n   * The increase of read buffer size is a hard requirement.\n   */\n  bool rbuff_grow_required;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != (MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ & c->event_loop_info));\n  mhd_assert (! c->discard_request);\n\n  rbuff_grow_required = (c->read_buffer_offset == c->read_buffer_size);\n  if (rbuff_grow_required)\n    rbuff_grow_desired = true;\n  else\n  {\n    rbuff_grow_desired = (c->read_buffer_offset + c->daemon->pool_increment >\n                          c->read_buffer_size);\n\n    if ((rbuff_grow_desired) &&\n        (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state))\n    {\n      if (! c->rq.have_chunked_upload)\n      {\n        mhd_assert (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN != c->rq.remaining_upload_size);\n        /* Do not grow read buffer more than necessary to process the current\n           request. */\n        rbuff_grow_desired =\n          (c->rq.remaining_upload_size > c->read_buffer_size);\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        mhd_assert (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN == c->rq.remaining_upload_size);\n        if (0 == c->rq.current_chunk_size)\n          rbuff_grow_desired =  /* Reading value of the next chunk size */\n                               (MHD_CHUNK_HEADER_REASONABLE_LEN >\n                                c->read_buffer_size);\n        else\n        {\n          const uint64_t cur_chunk_left =\n            c->rq.current_chunk_size - c->rq.current_chunk_offset;\n          /* Do not grow read buffer more than necessary to process the current\n             chunk with terminating CRLF. */\n          mhd_assert (c->rq.current_chunk_offset <= c->rq.current_chunk_size);\n          rbuff_grow_desired =\n            ((cur_chunk_left + 2) > (uint64_t) (c->read_buffer_size));\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (! rbuff_grow_desired)\n    return true; /* No need to increase the buffer */\n\n  if (try_grow_read_buffer (c, rbuff_grow_required))\n    return true; /* Buffer increase succeed */\n\n  if (! rbuff_grow_required)\n    return true; /* Can continue without buffer increase */\n\n  /* Failed to increase the read buffer size, but need to read the data\n     from the network.\n     No more space left in the buffer, no more space to increase the buffer. */\n\n  /* 'PROCESS_READ' event state flag must be set only if the last application\n     callback has processed some data.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Each executed operation in the fragment affects program behaviour: the switch assigns a meaningful 'stage' value that is subsequently passed to handle_recv_no_space(c, stage). The mhd_assert(0) in the default arm is intended to flag unexpected states (and may abort in debug builds); removing the assignment or the assert would change behaviour in at least some builds or run-time conditions. Unreachable-code note (2) does not apply because the default arm can be reached for certain c->state values. Therefore Rule 2.2 (no dead code) is not violated."
