  "explanation": "This function contains no direct calls to standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). However, the listed fragments influence buffer sizing, buffer offsets, or call other helpers that may perform memory copies/reads. These fragments therefore should be investigated to ensure any subsequent use of string.h functions (in try_grow_read_buffer, has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, handle_recv_no_space or other callees) cannot access beyond object bounds. The remaining code in the function (state-switch, enum assignments, mhd_assert checks, simple returns and comments) does not perform buffer accesses or pointer-based string operations and thus need not be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in the context of this function."
