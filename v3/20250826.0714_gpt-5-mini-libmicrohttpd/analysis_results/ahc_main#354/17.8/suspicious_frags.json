  "explanation": "The rest of the function only reads parameters, casts unused parameters to void, or assigns to local variables (e.g. url_len) and calls other functions; none of those actions modify the function parameters themselves (nor reassign pointer parameters). The only code that writes through a pointer parameter is the assignment to *req_cls inside the shown if-block, which therefore must be investigated to confirm compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (pointer parameter variable is not reassigned, but the object pointed-to is being modified). All other lines (comparisons, calls, strlen/memcmp, (void) casts, and reads like *upload_data_size) do not modify parameter variables and thus do not need investigation for this rule."
