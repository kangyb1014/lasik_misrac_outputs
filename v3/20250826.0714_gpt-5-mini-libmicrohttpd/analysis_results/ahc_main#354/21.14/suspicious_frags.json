  "explanation": "Only the two if-statements using memcmp are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 because the rule prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Other string comparisons in the function use strcmp (e.g. comparing method and url to \"/\"), which are intended for null-terminated strings and are not violations of Rule 21.14. The remaining code (checks of upload_data_size, req_cls handling, strlen(url) assigned to url_len, and returns of other helper functions) do not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and therefore do not need investigation under this specific rule."
