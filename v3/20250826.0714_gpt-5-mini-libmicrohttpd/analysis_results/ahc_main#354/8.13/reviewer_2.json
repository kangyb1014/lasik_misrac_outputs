True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code assigns the address of a non-const object to a pointer that is not const-qualified: *req_cls = &already_called_marker; The function only compares/stores the pointer value and never modifies the int through that pointer, so the pointer could/should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. a pointer-to-const or use a const marker). As written a non-const object address is stored in a non-const-target pointer, violating the \u201cpointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d guidance.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is essentially correct: the code stores the address of an object that is never modified (already_called_marker) into a non-const void* target (*req_cls), which runs counter to the MISRA C:2023 guidance of Rule 8.13 (prefer pointers to const-qualified types where possible). Concretely, req_cls is declared as void ** (pointer to non-const void), and the code does *req_cls = &already_called_marker; \u2014 so the pointer target is not const-qualified even though the pointed object is not modified via that pointer.\n\nHowever, in practice this \u201cviolation\u201d is constrained by the external API: ahc_main is implementing the libmicrohttpd callback prototype (void **con_cls / req_cls). That prototype requires void **, so changing the parameter to a pointer-to-const (or changing the callback signature) is not possible without breaking the required interface. Under MISRA this is a legitimate reason to document a deviation rather than change the callback signature. Possible mitigations are:\n- Declare already_called_marker as const if it truly is immutable and document the rationale (but be careful because other code paths may require a non-const object), or\n- Leave the API-compatible signature and document a formal MISRA deviation with justification (external API requirement).\n\nSo: Agent A correctly identified a mismatch with the spirit of Rule 8.13, but the code\u2019s use of the external callback API makes the issue unavoidable without breaking the required prototype. The preferred practical action is to document the deviation (or adjust the object\u2019s constness if compatible)."
