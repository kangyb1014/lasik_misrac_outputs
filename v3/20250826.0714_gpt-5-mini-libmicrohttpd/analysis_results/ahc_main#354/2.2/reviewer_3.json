Removing that statement would not change program behaviour (given that 'version' is not volatile and the cast has no side\u2011effects), so it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If 'version' were declared volatile or its evaluation had observable side\u2011effects, the statement would not be dead code.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour (i.e. dead code). The statement \"(void) version;\" is an executed no\u2011op whose sole purpose is to silence an unused\u2011parameter warning. Given the declaration shown (a non\u2011volatile const char * parameter), removing that statement would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The same reasoning applies to the other casts to void in the function such as \"(void) cls;\" and \"(void) upload_data;\".) Note: if the parameter were volatile or its evaluation had observable side\u2011effects, the cast would not be dead code, but that is not the case here."
