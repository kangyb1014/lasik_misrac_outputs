Its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it is an operation executed but without effect \u2014 i.e. dead code.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The single cast-to-void lines here ((void) cls; (void) version; (void) upload_data;) are the common idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to silence compiler warnings. They have no semantic effect (they do not perform I/O, do not call functions, and the parameters are non-volatile), and the intent is documentation/suppression rather than leftover logic. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour (dead code). While a strict reading could call any no-op executed instruction \u201cdead\u201d, MISRA and common practice treat explicit (void)parameter casts as the correct way to indicate an unused parameter and not as a defect to be removed \u2014 they are a sanctioned, harmless idiom. If there were an observable side effect from evaluating the expression (e.g. volatile or a function call), then it would not be removable and therefore not dead. Also note MISRA\u2019s timing caveat (note 1): if timing were critical such that removing the statement changes system behaviour, it would not be dead. In this case the agent\u2019s claim that (void) upload_data; is a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
