  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (conditions of if/while/for/do-while/switch). To avoid missing any possible invariant controlling expression, every if statement in the function is reported for further investigation. Other fragments are not reported because they are not controlling expressions or are clearly not invariant: the (void) casts are used only to silence unused-parameter warnings (not control expressions); the static variable declaration is not a controlling expression; the assignment url_len = strlen(url) is an expression statement (not a control); the final return and intermediate return calls are actions, not controlling expressions; there are no loop constructs (so the exception for infinite loops or the permitted do-while case does not apply). Therefore only the if conditions were flagged for review against Rule 14.3."
