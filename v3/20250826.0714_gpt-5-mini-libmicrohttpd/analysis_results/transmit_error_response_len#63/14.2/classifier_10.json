  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of transmit_error_response_len:\n```c\nstatic void\ntransmit_error_response_len (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             unsigned int status_code,\n                             const char *message,\n                             size_t message_len,\n                             char *header_name,\n                             size_t header_name_len,\n                             char *header_value,\n                             size_t header_value_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  enum MHD_Result iret;\n\n  mhd_assert (! connection->stop_with_error); /* Do not send error twice */\n  if (connection->stop_with_error)\n  { /* Should not happen */\n    if (MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED > connection->state)\n      connection->state = MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED;\n    free (header_name);\n    free (header_value);\n    return;\n  }\n  connection->stop_with_error = true;\n  connection->discard_request = true;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n            _ (\"Error processing request (HTTP response code is %u ('%s')). \" \\\n               \"Closing connection.\\n\"),\n            status_code,\n            message);\n#endif\n  if (MHD_CONNECTION_START_REPLY < connection->state)\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Too late to send an error response, \" \\\n                 \"response is being sent already.\\n\"),\n              status_code,\n              message);\n#endif\n    CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                            _ (\"Too late for error response.\"));\n    free (header_name);\n    free (header_value);\n    return;\n  }\n  /* TODO: remove when special error queue function is implemented */\n  connection->state = MHD_CONNECTION_FULL_REQ_RECEIVED;\n  if (0 != connection->read_buffer_size)\n  {\n    /* Read buffer is not needed anymore, discard it\n     * to free some space for error response. */\n    MHD_pool_deallocate (connection->pool,\n                         connection->read_buffer,\n                         connection->read_buffer_size);\n    connection->read_buffer = NULL;\n    connection->read_buffer_size = 0;\n    connection->read_buffer_offset = 0;\n  }\n  if (NULL != connection->rp.response)\n  {\n    MHD_destroy_response (connection->rp.response);\n    connection->rp.response = NULL;\n  }\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (message_len,\n                                                     message);\n  if (NULL == response)\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Failed to create error response.\\n\"),\n              status_code,\n              message);\n#endif\n    /* can't even send a reply, at least close the connection */\n    connection->state = MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED;\n    free (header_name);\n    free (header_value);\n    return;\n  }\n  mhd_assert ((0 == header_name_len) || (NULL != header_name));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL == header_name) || (0 != header_name_len));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == header_value_len) || (NULL != header_value));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL == header_value) || (0 != header_value_len));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL == header_name) || (NULL != header_value));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != header_value) || (NULL == header_name));\n  if (NULL != header_name)\n  {\n    iret = MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (response,\n                                             MHD_HEADER_KIND,\n                                             header_name, header_name_len,\n                                             header_value, header_value_len);\n    if (MHD_NO == iret)\n    {\n      free (header_name);\n      free (header_value);\n    }\n  }\n  else\n    iret = MHD_YES;\n\n  if (MHD_NO != iret)\n  {\n    bool before = connection->in_access_handler;\n\n    /* Fake the flag for the internal call */\n    connection->in_access_handler = true;\n    iret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                               status_code,\n                               response);\n    connection->in_access_handler = before;\n  }\n  MHD_destroy_response (response);\n  if (MHD_NO == iret)\n  {\n    /* can't even send a reply, at least close the connection */\n    CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                            _ (\"Closing connection \" \\\n                               \"(failed to queue error response).\"));\n    return;\n  }\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->rp.response);\n  /* Do not reuse this connection. */\n  connection->keepalive = MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE;\n  if (MHD_NO == build_header_response (connection))\n  {\n    /* No memory.

  "scenario": "Rule 14.2 applies to for statements. The fragment is a single assignment of a function/macro call (iret = MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_(...)); there is no for loop here, so Rule 14.2 is not applicable and not violated. (Caveat: if MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ is a macro that expands to a for statement, that expansion must be inspected for compliance with Rule 14.2.)"
