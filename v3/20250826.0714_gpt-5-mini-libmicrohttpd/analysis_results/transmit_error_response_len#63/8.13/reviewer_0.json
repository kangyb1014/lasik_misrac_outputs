True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameters header_name and header_value are declared as char * but in this function they are only read (passed to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ and freed) and never modified. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, these pointers should be const-qualified when possible, i.e. declared as const char * to reflect that the pointed-to data is not modified. The unconditional free() calls do not justify making the pointer non-const by themselves \u2014 if the function is intended to take ownership and free the buffers, that ownership intent should be made explicit in the API; otherwise the non-const declaration is a violation of 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 recommends using const-qualified pointee types when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. In this function header_name and header_value are not only read: they are passed to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (an API that, by its name and usage, likely takes ownership or expects a non-const pointer) and they are explicitly freed on error paths. Because the function takes ownership / deallocates the buffers (and interacts with APIs that take non-const pointers), it is not possible to const-qualify these parameters without changing the ownership semantics or introducing casts to discard const qualifiers (which MISRA forbids). Therefore it is appropriate that the parameters are declared as char * and MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not violated in this context. If the API were intended only to view immutable data and never to free or transfer ownership, then const would be appropriate; but that is not the situation here."
