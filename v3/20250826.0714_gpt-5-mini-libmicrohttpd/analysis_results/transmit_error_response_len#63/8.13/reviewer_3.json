According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so these should be declared as const char * (message is already const-qualified).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 says pointers should be const-qualified when possible, but \u201cwhen possible\u201d means you must be able to treat the pointed-to object as immutable and not need to pass it to APIs that require a non-const pointer or to perform ownership operations (like deallocation) that would force you to discard qualifiers. In this function header_name and header_value are treated as owned, non-const buffers: they are passed to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (an API that by its name suggests it takes ownership / expects non-const memory) and they are freed() in several code paths. free() and many existing APIs take void * / non-const pointers; changing the parameter types to const char * would either require casting away const when calling those APIs (which would itself violate other MISRA rules) or would force API changes throughout the code base. Because the pointers are used in a way that requires non-const (ownership/deallocation and passing to non-const APIs), declaring them const is not possible here and the code does not violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
