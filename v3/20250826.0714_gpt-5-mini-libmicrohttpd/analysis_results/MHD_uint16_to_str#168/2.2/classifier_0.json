The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_uint16_to_str:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_uint16_to_str (uint16_t val,\n                   char *buf,\n                   size_t buf_size)\n{\n  char *chr;  /**< pointer to the current printed digit */\n  /* The biggest printable number is 65535 */\n  uint16_t divisor = UINT16_C (10000);\n  int digit;\n\n  chr = buf;\n  digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n  mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n\n  /* Do not print leading zeros */\n  while ((0 == digit) && (1 < divisor))\n  {\n    divisor /= 10;\n    digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n    mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n  }\n\n  while (0 != buf_size)\n  {\n    *chr = (char) ((char) digit + '0');\n    chr++;\n    buf_size--;\n    if (1 == divisor)\n      return (size_t) (chr - buf);\n    val = (uint16_t) (val % divisor);\n    divisor /= 10;\n    digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n    mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n  }\n  return 0; /* The buffer is too small */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (digit < 10);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement mhd_assert(digit < 10); is an invariant check (diagnostic assertion). It is not dead code because it can change program behaviour by causing a failure/abort when the condition is false (and thus its removal would change behaviour in that case). If the macro is compiled out (expands to nothing) then it is not executed and therefore not subject to Rule 2.2. A true violation would occur only if mhd_assert is compiled into the executable as an operation that is always executed but has no observable effect (for example, a call or evaluation that cannot fail and does not change program state or timing) \u2014 in that specific case its presence would constitute dead code."
