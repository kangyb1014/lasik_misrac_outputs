  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp appear in the provided function. The code performs numeric arithmetic and writes characters into the provided buffer; it does not call any string-comparison functions (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) nor does it attempt to compare null-terminated strings. The only macro invoked is mhd_assert with integer comparisons (digit < 10), which is not a string comparison and cannot hide a memcmp use in these calls. Therefore there are no code fragments within this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
