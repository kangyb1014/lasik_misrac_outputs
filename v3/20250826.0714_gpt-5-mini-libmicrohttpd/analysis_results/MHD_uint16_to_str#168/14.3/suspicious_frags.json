  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and therefore no fragments needing investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Analysis by control point:\n\n- while ((0 == digit) && (1 < divisor)) \u2014 Both operands (digit and divisor) are updated inside the loop (digit is recomputed each iteration and divisor is divided by 10). The condition is therefore variant and not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- while (0 != buf_size) \u2014 buf_size is decremented inside the loop (buf_size--), so this controlling expression is variant.\n\n- if (1 == divisor) \u2014 This is a conditional, not a loop control, and divisor is modified earlier in the function; it is not an invariant expression.\n\n- There are no do-while loops or intentionally invariant loop conditions (infinite loops) in the function that would fall under the rule exceptions.\n\nOther expressions (mhd_assert checks) are not loop controlling expressions. Given the updates to the variables used in the loop conditions, there are no invariant controlling expressions to report."
