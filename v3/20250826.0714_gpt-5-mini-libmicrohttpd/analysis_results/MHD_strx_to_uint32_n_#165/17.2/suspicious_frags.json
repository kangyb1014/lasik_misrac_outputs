  "explanation": "The only function invocation within MHD_strx_to_uint32_n_ is the call toxdigitvalue, which is therefore the sole site that could possibly lead to indirect recursion back to MHD_strx_to_uint32_n_. No direct self-call to MHD_strx_to_uint32_n_ appears in the fragment. Other parts of the code are local operations (initialisation, integer arithmetic, comparisons, loop control, pointer null checks, and the assignment *out_val = res) and do not perform function calls or use function pointers that could cause recursion. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
