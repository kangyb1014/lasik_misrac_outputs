  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- Standard fixed-width and standard types are used (uint32_t, size_t) and the macro UINT32_MAX is from standard headers (stdint.h/limits). These are not compiler extensions.\n- All syntax constructs (function definition, while loop, if, casts, integer arithmetic, return) are standard C and do not rely on any vendor-specific keywords or built-ins.\n- There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang built-ins or attributes (__attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __asm__, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions), Microsoft-specific keywords, or other non-standard tokens.\n- The identifier toxdigitvalue() appears to be a user-defined function or macro; its presence is not itself a language extension. If that helper uses compiler extensions, that would need inspection in its own definition, but within this function its use is a plain call and not an extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
