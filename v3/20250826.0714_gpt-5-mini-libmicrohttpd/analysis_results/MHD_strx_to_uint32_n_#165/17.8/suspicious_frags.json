  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in a way that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Analysis of each parameter:\n- str: used only for read access via str[i]; the pointer variable str itself is not assigned to or incremented. The pointed-to object is treated as const, so no modification occurs. \n- maxlen: used only for comparison; not modified.\n- out_val: only dereferenced in the statement '*out_val = res;'. Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; the rule forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g., reassigning out_val), which does not occur here.\nNo other parameter assignments, pointer arithmetic on parameters, or parameter reassignments are present. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments to investigate for Rule 17.8."
