Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_response_options:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_response_options (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                          enum MHD_ResponseFlags flags,\n                          ...)\n{\n  va_list ap;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  enum MHD_ResponseOptions ro;\n\n  if (0 != (response->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH))\n  { /* Response has custom \"Content-Lengh\" header */\n    if ( (0 != (response->flags & MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH)) &&\n         (0 == (flags & MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH)))\n    { /* Request to remove MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH flag */\n      return MHD_NO;\n    }\n    if ( (0 != (response->flags & MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE)) &&\n         (0 == (flags & MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE)))\n    { /* Request to remove MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE flag */\n      if (0 == (flags & MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH))\n        return MHD_NO;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if ( (0 != (flags & MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE)) &&\n       (0 != response->total_size) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  ret = MHD_YES;\n  response->flags = flags;\n\n  va_start (ap, flags);\n  while (MHD_RO_END != (ro = va_arg (ap, enum MHD_ResponseOptions)))\n  {\n    switch (ro)\n    {\n    case MHD_RO_END: /* Not possible */\n      break;\n    default:\n      ret = MHD_NO;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  va_end (ap);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndefault:\n      ret = MHD_NO;\n      break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The default label in the switch assigns ret = MHD_NO when an option other than MHD_RO_END is encountered in the varargs loop. That assignment affects the function's return value (ret) and therefore affects program behaviour whenever a non-END response option is passed. Removing it would change the function\u2019s outcome for those inputs. Note: the explicit case MHD_RO_END in the switch truly is unreachable inside the loop (the loop stops when ro == MHD_RO_END) but unreachable code is not considered dead code by the rule's note. Consequently the default assignment is not dead code."
