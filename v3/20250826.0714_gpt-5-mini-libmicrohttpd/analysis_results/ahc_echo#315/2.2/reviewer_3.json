  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) version;' is an executed no-op: it evaluates the parameter expression and discards the result, and it has no side effects for the declared type (const char *). Removing that statement would not change the program's observable behaviour, so according to the quoted definition in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 it constitutes dead code. (Caveat: if the parameter were of a type whose evaluation has side effects \u2014 e.g. volatile access \u2014 the statement would not be dead, but that is not the case here.)"
