  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s interpretation is not correct in the context of MISRA practice. The lines like \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d are the conventional, documented idiom to mark a function parameter as intentionally unused so as to silence compiler warnings and to document intent. MISRA\u2019s intent with Rule 2.2 is to ban executed code that is superfluous to program behaviour (and which therefore indicates a logic error or maintenance burden). In practice static analysis tools and MISRA guidance treat the explicit cast-to-void idiom as an acceptable way to indicate an unused parameter rather than as a problematic piece of \u2018dead code\u2019. If a project\u2019s policy were to treat every no-op expression statement as a violation, that would be a local policy decision or would require a formal deviation, but the agent\u2019s blanket claim that these casts violate Rule 2.2 is incorrect. (If you require stricter conformity, use compiler attributes or a single macro to annotate unused parameters so the intent is explicit and auditable.)"
