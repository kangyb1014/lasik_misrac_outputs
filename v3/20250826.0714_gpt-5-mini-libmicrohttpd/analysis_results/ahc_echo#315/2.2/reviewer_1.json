  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines like (void) upload_data_size; are the standard, deliberate idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. While such cast-to-void expression-statements have no computational effect, MISRA C Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid truly dead code that has no justification and whose removal would not affect program behaviour; it is not meant to prohibit the conventional explicit 'use' of an otherwise-unused parameter. Moreover, Note 1 of the rule points out that timing can matter in embedded systems, so one cannot automatically claim removal is safe without context. In short, the (void) cast is an explicit, documented way to denote an unused parameter and is not a Rule 2.2 violation in this context."
