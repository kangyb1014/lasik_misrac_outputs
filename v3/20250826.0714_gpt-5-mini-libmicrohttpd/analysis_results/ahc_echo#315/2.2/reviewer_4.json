  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The lines such as (void) cls; are the conventional idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused; they have no observable runtime side\u2011effects and typically do not generate any executable code. Because they do not constitute an executed operation with observable effect, they do not meet the rule's definition of dead code. In practice these casts are used to suppress compiler warnings and convey intent; if you prefer to avoid them you can remove the unused parameter or use compiler/annotation mechanisms, but their presence here is not a MISRA 2.2 violation."
