For example, if session->value_1 is a fixed-size buffer filled completely (e.g. char buf[10] filled with 10 bytes from read/memcpy with no terminating '\\0') or is NULL, strlen will scan past the buffer (or dereference NULL), causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. MAIN_PAGE (a string literal) is safe, but session->value_1 is unchecked here.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Rule 21.17 covers strlen and requires that uses of string.h functions must not allow accesses beyond the bounds of the objects pointed to. In the shown code strlen(session->value_1) is called with no prior validation: if session->value_1 is NULL or not NUL-terminated (for example a fixed-size buffer filled completely without a terminating '\\0'), strlen will read out of bounds (or dereference NULL), which is undefined behavior and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (As a side note, the code also assumes MAIN_PAGE\u2019s contents and format specifiers match the snprintf usage and the computed slen, which is another fragile area, but the central strlen issue already constitutes a rule 21.17 violation.)"
