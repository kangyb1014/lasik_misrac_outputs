  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or depend on the <string.h> string-handling functions or perform string buffer writes that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. Specifically: the (void) cls; line is just to silence an unused-parameter warning; the checks for NULL reply, the free(reply) path and the calls to add_session_cookie, MHD_add_response_header, fprintf, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response and the use of the MHD_Result enum are unrelated to string.h operations and do not perform pointer-based string accesses. The malloc/free usage is included above where it interacts with the computed size; other resource-management and HTTP response operations merely use the previously-constructed buffer or library APIs and do not themselves introduce string.h boundary concerns."
