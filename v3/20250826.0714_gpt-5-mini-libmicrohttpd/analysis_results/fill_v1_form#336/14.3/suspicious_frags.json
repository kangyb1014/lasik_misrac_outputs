  "explanation": "I examined all controlling expressions in the function. The function contains only a few if-statements: (NULL == reply), (NULL == response), and (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(...)). None of these are invariant because they depend on runtime results (malloc return, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback return, and the return value of MHD_add_response_header). There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements whose controlling expressions could be invariant (the function does not contain any loop constructs). Other expressions that might look fixed (e.g. slen = strlen(MAIN_PAGE) + strlen(session->value_1), snprintf size argument, the (void) cls; cast) are not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no controlling expressions in this function that meet the MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concern and no fragments need investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
