  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 17.2 (no self-calls). Reasoning:\n- There is no direct call to fill_v1_form anywhere in the function body.\n- No function pointer referring to fill_v1_form is passed; the only function pointer passed is &free (the standard library free), which cannot call fill_v1_form.\n- All called functions from this fragment are either standard library functions (strlen, malloc, snprintf, free, fprintf) or libmicrohttpd helpers (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) or add_session_cookie. None of these calls in this fragment provide evidence that they call back into fill_v1_form (they are not passed a pointer to this function).\n- There are no global/static function-pointer variables or assignments in this fragment that could create an indirect call chain back to fill_v1_form.\n- The function is declared static, but that only limits linkage and does not imply recursion.\n\nGiven the provided code only, there is no indication of direct or indirect self-calling; therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 17.2. If callers/implementations of add_session_cookie or the MHD_* functions (not shown here) contain callbacks that could invoke this handler, those external implementations would need review, but there is no evidence of such from the shown fragment."
