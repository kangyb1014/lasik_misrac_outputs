  "explanation": "I found no code constructs inside the function body that are statically unreachable: every return is conditional (early returns are reachable depending on runtime conditions), there are no statements following an unconditional return in the same execution path, no dead switch/case or labelled code that can never be reached, no infinite loops that hide later code, and no successive statements rendered unreachable by prior unconditional jumps within this function. Therefore none of the inner fragments (malloc/error branch, snprintf, response creation, header addition, queue/destroy/return) require investigation for Rule 2.1 as written.\n\nOne item that should be investigated at the translation-unit / project level is that the function is declared static. A static (file-scoped) function that is never referenced elsewhere in the same translation unit is effectively unreachable (dead) code. Whether this is a violation of MISRA Rule 2.1 depends on project-wide usage; that cannot be determined from this single function alone. Hence the static function declaration is reported for investigation. No other fragments inside the function indicate unreachable code."
