Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. Therefore this cast-to-void expression constitutes dead code. (Fix: omit the parameter name in the function definition or use an approved mechanism to mark parameters as unused.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statement '(void) cls;' is an executed expression statement that has no side effects on program behaviour; removing it does not change the program\u2019s observable behaviour (only compiler diagnostics). By the literal wording of MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 \u2014 \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d \u2014 this statement therefore qualifies as dead code. Thus agent A\u2019s identification is correct. (Practical remedies include omitting the parameter name in the function definition, using a standardized UNUSED macro/attribute, or otherwise documenting the unused parameter.)"
