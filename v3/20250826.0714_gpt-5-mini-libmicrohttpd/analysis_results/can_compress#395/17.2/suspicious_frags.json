  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function calls can_compress either directly or via a function pointer or callback evident in this snippet. The function body only calls: MHD_lookup_connection_value, strcmp, strstr, and strlen \u2014 none of which reference can_compress in this code. There are no function-pointer calls, no callbacks passed into other functions, no macro expansions shown that could expand to a call to can_compress, and no assignments or references to the function itself. Therefore there is no direct or apparent indirect recursion to investigate in this fragment. (Note: indirect recursion involving other parts of the codebase cannot be inferred from this single function; for that to be a concern would require examining the implementations of MHD_lookup_connection_value or other called functions to see if they could in turn call can_compress.)"
