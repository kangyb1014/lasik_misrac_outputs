  "explanation": "All other lines are either declarations, simple NULL checks, or return statements and do not directly call or index via the standard <string.h> routines covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The call that obtains ae is checked against NULL before any string functions are used, so there is no immediate NULL-pointer use elsewhere. The listed fragments are the only places where functions from <string.h> (strcmp, strstr, strlen) or direct indexing based on their results occur and therefore are the only code locations that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
