  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: an enum return type, a struct pointer parameter, standard library functions (strcmp, strstr, strlen), pointer arithmetic and indexing, string literals, and simple conditional logic. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* functions, GCC/Clang-specific keywords, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific syntax. Macros like MHD_NO/MHD_YES are normal identifiers/macros and are not language extensions themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
