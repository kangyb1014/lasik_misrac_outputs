  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (NULL == ae): depends on runtime result of MHD_lookup_connection_value.\n- if (0 == strcmp (ae, \"*\")): strcmp's return depends on ae at run time (the literal \"*\" does not make the expression invariant).\n- if (NULL == de): depends on runtime result of strstr.\n- the compound if (((de == ae) || (de[-1] == ',') || (de[-1] == ' ')) && ((de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == '\\0') || (de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == ',') || (de[strlen (\"deflate\")] == ';'))): although strlen(\"deflate\") is a compile-time constant, the overall expression depends on the runtime pointer de (and on ae for the de == ae check), so it is not invariant.\n\nThere are no loops (so the allowed infinite-loop exception is not relevant) and no do-while with an integer constant expression. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3."
