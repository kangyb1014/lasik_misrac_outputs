  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The initial guard if (0 == len) return 0; is an intended early exit for zero-length input \u2014 not unreachable code but a valid runtime path.\n- The odd-length handling (if (0 != len % 2)) consumes exactly one hex digit (r++ and w++). This makes the remaining characters an even count, guaranteeing that the subsequent while (r < len) loop always has pairs of characters to consume (two r++ operations per iteration). For example: if len is odd, after the single-digit branch r == 1 and len - r is even; if len is even, r starts at 0 so pairs remain.\n- The while loop body is reachable for any len > 0 not consumed by the odd branch; its two reads of hex[r++] are safe because of the invariant described above. The error returns inside the odd branch and inside the loop (when toxdigitvalue returns a negative value) are reachable runtime paths, not dead code.\n- The final mhd_assert calls and the return w are reachable at normal completion. (If mhd_assert is compiled out to nothing, that removes code but does not introduce unreachable code.)\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that are statically unreachable and warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
