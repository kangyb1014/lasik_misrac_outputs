  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the function is invariant per MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Analysis of each control construct:\n\n- if (0 == len): depends on the parameter len; not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (0 != len % 2): depends on len; value may vary between calls and is not an invariant within the function.\n- while (r < len): r is initialized to 0 and incremented (r++ in the loop body), so the controlling expression changes and is not invariant.\n- if ((0 > h) || (0 > l)): h and l are freshly computed from hex[r++] each time through the loop; the expression is not invariant.\n\nNo infinite-loop constructs or do-while constant-false exceptions apply. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
