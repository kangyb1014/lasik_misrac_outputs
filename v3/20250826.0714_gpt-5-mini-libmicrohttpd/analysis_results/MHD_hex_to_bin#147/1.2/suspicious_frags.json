  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for compiler-specific language extensions (extensions explicitly documented by compilers such as GCC/Clang/MSVC). No such extensions were found. Specifically checked and not present: __attribute__/__declspec, __asm__/asm statement, GCC/Clang typeof or statement-expressions, nested functions, inline assembly, __builtin_* intrinsics, attribute((...)) annotations, scoped assembly, designator extensions, and other vendor-specific keywords. The code uses standard C constructs only: casts, fixed-width integer types (uint8_t), size_t, block-scope declarations, plain function calls (toxdigitvalue, mhd_assert), pointer casts from void*, and standard operators. None of these are compiler language extensions per se, so there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
