  "explanation": "This function body contains no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so there are no direct violations in this snippet. The array accesses into hex are guarded by the initial length check (len != 0), the odd-length special-case that consumes one character, and the while (r < len) loop which\u2014given the prior handling of odd/even length\u2014ensures pairs of characters are available; therefore the hex[] reads themselves do not appear to index beyond the provided len. The writes to out[w++] depend on the caller-supplied buffer size (bin) and are not related to <string.h> usage; they should be checked by the caller but are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The only places that could indirectly invoke string.h routines are the calls to toxdigitvalue (and any macros or functions like mhd_assert if implemented elsewhere). toxdigitvalue may internally use string.h functions (for example strchr or strlen), so those call sites should be investigated to ensure any string.h usage inside toxdigitvalue does not access beyond the bounds of the objects passed (the hex pointer). No other fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 21.17 because they do not call or pass objects to standard string.h functions."
