  "explanation": "I found no places in this function that modify any of the function parameters themselves (hex, len, bin). Specific reasons:\n- hex: only read via indexing (hex[r++]) and passed to toxdigitvalue; no assignment to hex or hex++. Indexing does not modify the pointer parameter or the pointed-to object (and the pointer is a pointer to const anyway), so this is compliant with the rule.\n- len: only read (used in comparisons and tests), never assigned to or incremented, so the parameter is not modified.\n- bin: not assigned to; it is cast to a local pointer (uint8_t *const out = (uint8_t *) bin). That initializes a local pointer from the parameter but does not modify the bin parameter itself. The writes out[w++] = ... modify the object pointed to by bin (via out), which the rule permits (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified), but do not modify the pointer parameter.\n- All other assignments (r = 0; w = 0; r++, w++) are to local variables r and w, not to parameters.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
