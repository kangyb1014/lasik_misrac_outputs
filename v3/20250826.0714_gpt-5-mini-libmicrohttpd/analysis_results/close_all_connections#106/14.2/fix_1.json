  "explanation": "The compilation errors were caused by attempts to cast a thread-handle struct (type MHD_thread_handle_ID_) to unsigned long for printing. That type is not an arithmetic type, so those casts are invalid. I changed the formatting to print the address of the thread-handle object instead: replaced \"%lu\" and (unsigned long) pos->tid with \"%p\" and (void *)&pos->tid. This preserves the diagnostic information (shows the thread-handle value as a pointer) while avoiding invalid casts, and otherwise leaves the original logic intact."
