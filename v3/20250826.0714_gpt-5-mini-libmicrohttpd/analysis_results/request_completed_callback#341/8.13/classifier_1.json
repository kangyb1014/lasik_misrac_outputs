  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The local pointer 'request' is used to modify and free the object it points to (request->session->rc-- and free(request)). Therefore it must be a pointer to a mutable struct Request, not a pointer-to-const. Also req_cls is a void**, so changing to a pointer-to-const would be incompatible with the API. Consequently Rule 8.13 is not violated here."
