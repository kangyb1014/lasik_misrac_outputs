  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function dereferences req_cls to obtain a mutable struct Request * (struct Request *request = *req_cls;) and then modifies/frees that object (request->session->rc-- and free(request)). Because the code needs to modify the pointed-to object, making the pointed-to type const would be inappropriate. If the intent was only to avoid assigning to *req_cls (the pointer value) then a safer prototype would be void * const *req_cls to qualify the intermediate pointer as const, but the current void ** is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
