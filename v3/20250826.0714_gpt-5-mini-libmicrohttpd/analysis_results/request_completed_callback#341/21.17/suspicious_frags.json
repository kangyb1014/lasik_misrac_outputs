  "explanation": "I did not find any direct uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in this function. The remaining lines only perform pointer checks, a pointer assignment, a decrement, and free \u2014 none of which invoke the string handling functions or perform buffer/string operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses covered by Rule 21.17. The only function call that could possibly involve string.h routines internally is MHD_destroy_post_processor; therefore that call is reported for investigation so its implementation can be checked for any use of string.h functions that might access objects out of bounds. All other fragments do not use string handling functions and so do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
