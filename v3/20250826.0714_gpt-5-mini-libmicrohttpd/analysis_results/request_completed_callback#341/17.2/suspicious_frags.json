  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve function calls or callback-invoking operations that could produce direct or indirect recursion and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 17.2. Specifically: the (void) casts are just to silence compiler warnings; the local assignment struct Request *request = *req_cls; and the NULL check if (NULL == request) return; are simple pointer handling and control-flow guards; there are no other function calls in the body that could directly or indirectly call request_completed_callback. The three listed fragments are the only places where side effects or external library interaction occur and thus are the ones that warrant investigation for potential indirect self-calls."
