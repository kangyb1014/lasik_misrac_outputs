  "scenario": "No violation. The function request_completed_callback does not call itself directly. The call to the external function MHD_destroy_post_processor is not evidence of indirect recursion by itself. Only if MHD_destroy_post_processor (or functions it calls) were documented/known to invoke request_completed_callback would an indirect self-call occur \u2014 there is no such evidence in the provided code fragment."
