  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: request_completed_callback does not call itself, directly or indirectly. The call free(request) simply deallocates memory and does not invoke request_completed_callback. (A hypothetical violation would occur only if free were replaced by a custom allocator or wrapper that, directly or indirectly, called request_completed_callback \u2014 e.g. a custom_free that invokes the same callback \u2014 causing recursion.)"
