  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions (e.g. if/while/for/do-while conditions that are constant). In this function all controlling expressions are runtime-dependent:\n- request is assigned from *req_cls (a parameter) so \"if (NULL == request)\" is not a compile-time invariant.\n- \"if (NULL != request->session)\" depends on request->session, which is runtime data (not a constant).\n- \"if (NULL != request->pp)\" depends on request->pp, which is runtime data.\nThere are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions, nor any obvious infinite-loop intent. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (and the listed exceptions are not applicable)."
