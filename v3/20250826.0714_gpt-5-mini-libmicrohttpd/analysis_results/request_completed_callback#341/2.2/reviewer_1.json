Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of request_completed_callback.\n```c\nstatic void\nrequest_completed_callback (void *cls,\n                            struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            void **req_cls,\n                            enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct Request *request = *req_cls;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

Its removal would not alter program behaviour, therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. Although the three statements (void) cls;, (void) connection; and (void) toe; are no\u2011ops at runtime, they are the conventional, intentional way to document and suppress \u201cunused parameter\u201d compiler diagnostics. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids true dead code that has no role in the program\u2019s design and whose removal would not affect program behaviour; MISRA\u2019s intent does not treat deliberate unused\u2011parameter annotations used to convey intent and avoid diagnostics as violations. If the project policy prefers a different style, parameters can be omitted from the identifier list or a project\u2011wide UNUSED_PARAM macro can be used, but the presented code should not be reported as violating Rule 2.2."
