  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code calls free(request) where request = *req_cls. This deallocates the object pointed to by the pointer parameter but does not assign to req_cls or *req_cls (the pointer parameter itself is not modified). Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but forbids modifying the pointer variable itself. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 17.8. (Note: it may leave a dangling pointer in the caller; clearing *req_cls would be allowed but is not done here.)"
