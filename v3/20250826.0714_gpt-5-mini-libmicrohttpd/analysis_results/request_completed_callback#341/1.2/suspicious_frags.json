  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the supplied function. The code uses only standard C constructs: static storage-class specifier, pointer and enum types, casts to (void) to silence unused-parameter warnings, dereference/assignment of pointers, calls to library/API functions, NULL checks, and free(). There are no compiler-extension tokens or idioms such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), _Pragma with compiler-specific flags, GNU inline-asm, nonstandard integer types, or other documented compiler extensions. The implicit conversion from void* to struct Request* (via *req_cls) is standard C pointer semantics, not a compiler extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
