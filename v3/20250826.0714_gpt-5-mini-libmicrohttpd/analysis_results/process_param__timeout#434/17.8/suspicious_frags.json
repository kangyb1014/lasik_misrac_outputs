  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. Details:\n- The function parameters are: const char *param_name, const char *param_tail, const char *next_param. Neither the pointer variables nor the objects they point to are assigned to within the function.\n- The call to get_param_value passes the pointer parameters by value (not by address) and does not reassign them; calling a function with these arguments does not modify the local parameter variables.\n- Local variables (param_value, value_res) are declared and modified locally \u2014 these are not function parameters.\n- The assignment tool_params.timeout = param_value modifies a global/extern object, not any function parameter.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (no function parameter is modified)."
