  "explanation": "No pointer targets in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The three string parameters are declared as const char * (param_name, param_tail, next_param), so they already point to const-qualified types. The only non-const pointer usage is the address-of operator on param_value (&param_value) passed to get_param_value; this is an output parameter that must be writable by the callee, so it correctly points to a non-const unsigned int. There are no other pointer variables or assignments in this fragment. (If tool_params.timeout were a pointer type, that would need review, but the assignment from an unsigned int value strongly indicates timeout is an integer field, not a pointer.)"
