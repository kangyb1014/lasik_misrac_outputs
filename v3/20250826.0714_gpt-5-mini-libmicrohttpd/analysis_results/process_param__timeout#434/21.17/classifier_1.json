  "scenario": "The call itself does not invoke any <string.h> function and therefore cannot by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation would only occur if the implementation of get_param_value uses string.h functions unsafely. Example violation scenario: get_param_value does strcpy(dest, param_tail) or memcpy(dest, param_tail, strlen(param_tail)+1) into a fixed-size dest buffer that is smaller than strlen(param_tail)+1, causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds write; or it calls strlen/strspn on a non\u2011null\u2011terminated range referenced by param_tail/next_param causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read. To comply, get_param_value must ensure destination buffers are large enough and use length-bounded operations and explicit bounds checks."
