  "explanation": "The only potential sources of out-of-bounds accesses related to <string.h> in this function are the pointer parameters and the call that forwards them to get_param_value. The rest of the code (declarations of param_value and value_res, the comparison against PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, the assignment tool_params.timeout = param_value, and the return statements) do not perform any string operations, pointer arithmetic, or buffer accesses and therefore cannot violate MISRA C Rule 21.17. Investigate the function signature (pointer parameters) and the call to get_param_value to ensure that the string handling inside get_param_value (and any functions it calls) does not access beyond the bounds of the objects pointed to by param_name, param_tail, or next_param."
