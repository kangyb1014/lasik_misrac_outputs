  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in this fragment. The code does not perform any string comparisons itself \u2014 it only declares const char * parameters and passes them unchanged to get_param_value, performs an enum comparison (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR) and assigns an unsigned int to tool_params.timeout. None of these constitute comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp. If there is concern about memcmp usage, the only place to inspect would be the implementation of get_param_value (not provided here); however, within the shown code there are no calls to memcmp nor any direct string comparisons that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
