  "explanation": "Only function calls (direct or indirect) can cause a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. In this fragment the only real function call is get_param_value \u2014 that call needs investigation because it may invoke callbacks or other functions that could (directly or indirectly) call process_param__timeout. The other code elements are not sources of recursion: variable declarations and the return statements cannot cause self-calls; the assignment to tool_params.timeout is a plain data assignment (not a function call) as shown in the code, so it cannot create recursion unless tool_params or timeout are implemented as macros or functions elsewhere \u2014 the assignment line is included so reviewers can verify that tool_params.timeout is in fact a data member and not a macro/function. The function being static only affects linkage and is not itself an indication of recursion. No direct call to process_param__timeout appears in the presented code."
