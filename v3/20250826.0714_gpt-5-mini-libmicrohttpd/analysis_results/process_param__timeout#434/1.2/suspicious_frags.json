  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for any compiler-specific language extensions. None are present. Specifically, the code does not use any of the common vendor/compiler extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions, such as: __attribute__ or __declspec, __asm or asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), computed goto, __builtin_* intrinsics, pragma implementation-specific uses, or any other non-standard keywords/syntax. The function uses only standard C constructs: static storage-class, an enum type, const char*, unsigned int, simple function call and return, and an ordinary assignment. The double underscore in the identifier (process_param__timeout) is a reserved-name/style concern but is not a compiler language extension and thus is outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as defined in your request. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for use of compiler language extensions."
