  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME)) depends on the runtime value of daemon->options and is not an invariant compile-time constant. (A violation would occur only if daemon->options and the macro/mask were known to be constant such that the test is always true or always false\u2014for example if options were a compile-time constant 0 and the mask is fixed, making the expression invariant.)"
