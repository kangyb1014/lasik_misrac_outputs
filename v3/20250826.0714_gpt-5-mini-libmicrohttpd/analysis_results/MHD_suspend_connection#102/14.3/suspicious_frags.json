  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not contain controlling expressions that could be invariant and thus do not need investigation under MISRA C:14.3. The function epilogue call internal_suspend_connection_(connection) is a normal call, not a control expression. The MHD_PANIC and MHD_DLOG invocations are macro/function calls (not controlling expressions themselves). Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT, #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) are compile-time inclusion directives rather than C controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in the function besides the if statements listed above. Therefore only the listed if/mhd_assert controlling expressions warrant further investigation for potential invariance."
