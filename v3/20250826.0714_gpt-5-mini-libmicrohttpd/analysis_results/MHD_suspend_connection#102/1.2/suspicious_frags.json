  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C and not compiler-specific extensions: \n- Preprocessor conditionals and line-continuation backslashes (used in multi-line macros/expressions) are standard preprocessor features, not extensions. \n- Adjacent string literal concatenation (split across source lines) is standard C. \n- Macro identifiers and calls (e.g. _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_PANIC, mhd_assert, _) are user-defined macros; their use does not by itself imply a compiler extension. \n- No GCC/Clang-specific extensions are present (no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other compiler builtins). \n- No non-standard keywords or constructs (inline assembly, compiler pragmas beyond standard #ifdef/#endif) are used. \nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If any of the macros expand to compiler-specific extensions, those expansions would need review, but the snippet shown contains no explicit extension usage."
