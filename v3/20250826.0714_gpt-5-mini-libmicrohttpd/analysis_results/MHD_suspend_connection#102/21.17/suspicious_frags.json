  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. The occurrences of textual strings are string literals passed to macros (MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG) and are formed by adjacent literal concatenation (via line continuation), which is a compile-time operation and cannot cause runtime out-of-bounds accesses. Pointer dereferences in the code (e.g., connection->daemon, connection->urh) do not involve string handling functions. The call to internal_suspend_connection_ could be inspected for string handling issues, but that function's implementation is not present in this fragment; likewise, any string operations potentially hidden inside macros (MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG, _()) are outside the scope of this function and would need to be reviewed in their own definitions. Therefore, there are no suspicious fragments in this code that directly implicate Rule 21.17."
