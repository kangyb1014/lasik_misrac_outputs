  "explanation": "I examined the entire MHD_suspend_connection function provided. There are no calls to memcmp in this code, nor are there any comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The function only performs: flag/bitwise checks (daemon->options & ...), pointer checks (NULL != connection->urh), logging/panic calls with string literals, and calls to other functions/macros (MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG, internal_suspend_connection_). None of these lines in the shown fragment use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. \n\nNote: If you want to be sure there is no violation elsewhere, the bodies/definitions of the called macros/functions (e.g., MHD_DLOG, MHD_PANIC, internal_suspend_connection_, or any macros expanded here) should be inspected, but they are not part of the provided code. Based solely on the provided function body, there are no suspicious fragments for Rule 21.14."
