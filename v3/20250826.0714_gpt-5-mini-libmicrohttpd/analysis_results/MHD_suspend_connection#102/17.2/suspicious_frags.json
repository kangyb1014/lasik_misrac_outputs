  "explanation": "The remaining code in the function consists of declarations, preprocessor conditionals, constant/bitmask checks, assignment of a local const pointer, simple if/return control flow and comments. Those fragments do not contain function calls (except the function-like macros/calls listed above) and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion into MHD_suspend_connection. The suspicious list includes all function calls and function-like macro invocations present in the snippet (the assert and its sub-calls, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG and the call to internal_suspend_connection_) so that any potential direct or indirect self-call paths through those calls can be investigated. No other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they are not call sites."
