  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_suspend_connection:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN void\nMHD_suspend_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical configurations: the code inside #ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS is an assertion (mhd_assert) that either generates diagnostics/abort when enabled or is removed by the preprocessor when assertions are disabled. In normal use this is not dead code because it either has an observable effect (when enabled) or is not present at all (when disabled). \n\nConcrete violation scenario (if present): if mhd_assert is defined so that it evaluates its argument at runtime but performs no observable action (for example #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)(x))) and the expression passed has no side effects, then that evaluated-but-effectless operation would be executed yet removable without changing program behaviour \u2014 this would constitute dead code under Rule 2.2."
