  "scenario": "The single comparison `if (NULL != connection->urh)` only reads the pointer value and does not itself require the pointed-to type to be const. Whether Rule 8.13 is violated depends on how `urh` is declared and used elsewhere. If `urh` is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. `struct URH *urh;`) but the pointee is never modified through that pointer (it should be treated read-only), then the declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. `const struct URH *urh;`). From this fragment alone you cannot prove a violation \u2014 you must inspect the declaration of `urh` and all its uses."
