  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not necessarily violated. The call itself does not violate Rule 8.13 if internal_suspend_connection_ needs to modify the MHD_Connection object (i.e. its prototype accepts struct MHD_Connection * and performs writes). A violation would occur if internal_suspend_connection_ does not modify the pointed-to object (its implementation only reads it) but its parameter is declared as a non-const pointer \u2014 in that case the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct MHD_Connection *), and the current usage would violate Rule 8.13."
