  "explanation": "I have selected fragments that can give rise to unreachable-code concerns and therefore should be investigated: the assertion block (may be compiled out or evaluate to a constant), the conditional that invokes MHD_PANIC (MHD_PANIC may be a non-returning termination routine), the UPGRADE_SUPPORT block (contains an early return that makes subsequent code unreachable on that path, and the logging is conditional on HAVE_MESSAGES), and the final call to internal_suspend_connection_ (this call could be unreachable if the preceding panic or return paths are non-returning or always taken). Other parts of the function (the function header, the local daemon declaration, and ordinary control flow outside the indicated conditional/conditional-compilation blocks) are standard and reachable in at least some execution/configuration scenarios, so they do not need to be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.1 issues here."
