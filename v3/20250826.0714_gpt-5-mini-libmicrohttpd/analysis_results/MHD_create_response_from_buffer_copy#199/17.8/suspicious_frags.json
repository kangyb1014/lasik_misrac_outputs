  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: (1) size (type size_t) \u2014 it is only read and passed by value to other functions and used to allocate and initialize data; there is no assignment, increment/decrement, or other modification of the variable 'size' itself. (2) buffer (type const void *) \u2014 it is only used as the source argument to memcpy and tested for NULL; the pointer itself is not assigned to or altered, and the const qualifier prevents modifying the object it points to. All other assignments affect local variables (mhd_copy, r) or members of the response object (r->data_buffer_size), not the incoming parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
