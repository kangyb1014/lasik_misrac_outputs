  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no call to memcmp (or any other binary comparison function applied to strings). It uses memcpy, malloc, free and checks size and buffer pointers; these do not violate Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
