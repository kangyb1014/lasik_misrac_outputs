  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy (size_t size,\n                                      const void *buffer)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  void *mhd_copy;\n\n  if (0 == size)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (0,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL);\n  if (NULL == buffer)\n    return NULL;\n\n  mhd_copy = malloc (size);\n  if (NULL == mhd_copy)\n    return NULL;\n  memcpy (mhd_copy, buffer, size);\n\n  r = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                              mhd_copy,\n                                                              &free,\n                                                              mhd_copy);\n  if (NULL == r)\n    free (mhd_copy);\n  else\n  {\n    /* TODO: remove the next assignment, the buffer should not be modifiable */\n    r->data_buffer_size = size;\n  }\n\n  return r;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == size)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (0,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If size == 0 and buffer == NULL, the fragment returns the response from MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls(0, NULL, NULL, NULL). If the fragment were removed execution would fall through to the subsequent 'if (NULL == buffer) return NULL;' and the function would return NULL instead \u2014 behavior would change, so the fragment is not dead code."
