Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy (size_t size,\n                                      const void *buffer)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *r;\n  void *mhd_copy;\n\n  if (0 == size)\n    return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (0,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL,\n                                                                   NULL);\n  if (NULL == buffer)\n    return NULL;\n\n  mhd_copy = malloc (size);\n  if (NULL == mhd_copy)\n    return NULL;\n  memcpy (mhd_copy, buffer, size);\n\n  r = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                              mhd_copy,\n                                                              &free,\n                                                              mhd_copy);\n  if (NULL == r)\n    free (mhd_copy);\n  else\n  {\n    /* TODO: remove the next assignment, the buffer should not be modifiable */\n    r->data_buffer_size = size;\n  }\n\n  return r;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nr = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                              mhd_copy,\n                                                              &free,\n                                                              mhd_copy);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls constructs and returns a response object assigned to 'r', which is subsequently checked, used (possible free on failure, assignment to r->data_buffer_size on success) and ultimately returned. Removing this call would change program behaviour (allocation, ownership and return value), so it is not dead code. A violation would occur if the call (and its side-effects) were executed but its result and side-effects were never used (for example if 'r' were never read or the callback never invoked), or if the call were provably redundant due to earlier unconditional returns making it unreachable/unused."
