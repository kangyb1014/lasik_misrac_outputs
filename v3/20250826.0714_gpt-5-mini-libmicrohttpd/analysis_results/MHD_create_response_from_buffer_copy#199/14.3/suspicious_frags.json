  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. All conditional expressions depend on runtime values or parameters: (0 == size) depends on the caller-provided size, (NULL == buffer) depends on the caller-provided pointer, (NULL == mhd_copy) depends on the result of malloc, and (NULL == r) depends on the result of the called constructor. There are no loops or constants used as loop/conditional controls that would be considered invariant under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other statements (malloc, memcpy, the assignment to r->data_buffer_size, function calls) are not controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
