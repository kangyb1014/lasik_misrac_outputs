  "explanation": "No other calls to <string.h> functions appear in the snippet, so there are no additional string-handling calls to inspect for this rule. The code contains an explicit early return for size == 0 and an explicit NULL check for the input buffer, preventing a direct zero-size or NULL-buffer memcpy call. The destination buffer is allocated (and the allocation result is checked) before use, and there is no arithmetic on size that could introduce an integer overflow prior to the copy. Other statements (error returns, free-on-failure, setting r->data_buffer_size, and the call to create the response with a free callback) are not calls to string.h functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated for out-of-bounds string function usage."
