  "explanation": "All other constructs in the snippet are standard C and not compiler-specific language extensions. Examples include: use of standard types (size_t), storage/class specifiers (struct), pointer and const qualifiers (const void *buffer), standard library functions and expressions (malloc, memcpy, free, NULL), taking a function address (e.g. &free), pointer member access (r->data_buffer_size), return and if statements, and block comments. The function call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls and identifiers with leading underscores are ordinary identifiers/macros in source code; they are not by themselves language extensions. Therefore they do not need further investigation for compiler-specific language-extension usage. The only token that may expand to a compiler-specific extension is the identifier _MHD_EXTERN (commonly a macro that can map to __attribute__ or __declspec); that is why the function declaration line containing _MHD_EXTERN is reported for investigation."
