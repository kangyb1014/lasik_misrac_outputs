  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#if defined(HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY_NP) && defined(HAVE_GETPID)\n  /* NetBSD style */\n  cpuset_t *cpuset_ptr;\n  cpuset_ptr = cpuset_create ();\n  if (NULL != cpuset_ptr)\n  {\n    if (0 == sched_getaffinity_np (getpid (), cpuset_size (cpuset_ptr),\n                                   cpuset_ptr))\n    {\n      cpuid_t cpu_num;\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(HAVE_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)\n      unsigned int max_num = 0;\n      long sc_value;\n      sc_value = sysconf (_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);\n      if (0 < sc_value)\n        max_num = (unsigned int) sc_value;\n      if (0 < max_num)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        for (cpu_num = 0; cpu_num < max_num; ++cpu_num)\n          if (0 < cpuset_isset (cpu_num, cpuset_ptr))\n            ++ret;\n      }\n      else /* Combined with the next 'if' */\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && HAVE_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF */\n      if (1)\n      {\n        int res;\n        cpu_num = 0;\n        ret = 0;\n        do\n        {\n          res = cpuset_isset (cpu_num++, cpuset_ptr);\n          if (0 < res)\n            ++ret;\n        } while (0 <= res);\n      }\n#ifdef __NetBSD__\n      if (0 == ret)\n      {\n        /* On NetBSD \"unset\" affinity (exactly zero CPUs) means\n           \"all CPUs are available\". */\n        ret = mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_ ();\n      }\n#endif /* __NetBSD__ */\n    }\n    cpuset_destroy (cpuset_ptr);\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY_NP && HAVE_GETPID */\n  if (0 >= ret)\n    return -1;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndo\n        {\n          res = cpuset_isset (cpu_num++, cpuset_ptr);\n          if (0 < res)\n            ++ret;\n        } while (0 <= res);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Rule 14.2 applies only to for statements. The fragment is a do...while loop, so Rule 14.2 (well\u2011formed for loop clauses and single loop counter restrictions) does not apply and is not violated. (Note: the code does modify cpu_num via cpu_num++ inside the loop body \u2014 which would violate the for\u2011loop specific constraints if this were written as a for loop \u2014 but as written it is a do...while and therefore outside the scope of Rule 14.2.)"
