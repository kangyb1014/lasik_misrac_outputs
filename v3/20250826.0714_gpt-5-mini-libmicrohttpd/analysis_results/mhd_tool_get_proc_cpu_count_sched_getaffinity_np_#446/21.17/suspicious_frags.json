  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string-handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. The code calls cpuset_create, cpuset_size, sched_getaffinity_np, cpuset_isset, cpuset_destroy and sysconf, but none of these are functions from <string.h>. Therefore there are no string.h calls that could cause out-of-bounds accesses covered by Rule 21.17 to inspect. Note: other potential runtime issues (e.g. whether cpuset_isset accesses beyond the cpuset buffer) are implementation-specific concerns but are outside the scope of MISRA Rule 21.17, which is limited to string handling functions from <string.h>."
