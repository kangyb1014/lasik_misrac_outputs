  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not present obvious unreachable-code issues and need not be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.1 in this function:\n\n- The top-level #if/#endif (HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY_NP && HAVE_GETPID) guards the whole cpuset-based logic; code inside that block is conditionally compiled and thus not \"unreachable\" in the compiled output when the macros are defined.\n- The cpuset allocation, NULL check (if (NULL != cpuset_ptr)), and cpuset_destroy(cpuset_ptr) form a normal runtime path: cpuset_create may return NULL or non-NULL, so the guarded code is reachable when cpuset_ptr != NULL.\n- The sched_getaffinity_np(getpid(), ...) call is executed at runtime and the subsequent block is entered only when it returns 0; this is a valid runtime branch and therefore not statically unreachable.\n- The initialisation ret = -1 and the final test if (0 >= ret) return -1; return ret; are reachable and form the normal return behaviour when the affinity-based counting is not performed or yields non-positive results.\n- Local variable declarations (ret, cpuset_ptr, cpu_num, etc.) and ordinary statements not listed above are standard and reachable depending on the runtime and preprocessor configuration.\n\nThe three fragments reported above were selected because they involve constant condition / preprocessor interplay (the explicit if (1) used together with an #if ... else comment, and the NetBSD-specific fallback) which may create code that is effectively unreachable in certain compile-time or runtime configurations and therefore merit further investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
