  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code fragment, nor are there any direct comparisons of null-terminated strings using byte-wise comparisons. The fragment only performs pointer/member access, boolean checks, bitwise operations, calls to internal helper macros/functions (XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, EDLL_remove, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, MHD_PANIC), and a call to epoll_ctl. None of these lines in this snippet use memcmp or perform memcmp-like comparisons on C strings. \n\nIf further investigation is required, only the implementations of the called functions/macros (XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, EDLL_remove, MHD_PANIC, etc.) could potentially contain memcmp misuse; those implementations are not part of this code fragment and therefore are not flagged here. Based on the code shown, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 21.14."
