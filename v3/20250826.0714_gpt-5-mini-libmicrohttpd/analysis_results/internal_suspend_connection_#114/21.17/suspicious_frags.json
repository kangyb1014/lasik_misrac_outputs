  "explanation": "I found no uses of any of the standard <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided function. There are no direct raw buffer/character-array manipulations or calls that pass pointer parameters to those string.h functions in this code fragment. The visible calls/macros (XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, EDLL_remove, epoll_ctl, MHD_mutex_* and MHD_* macros) do not themselves show any string.h usage in this snippet; without their definitions there is no evidence here that any of them invoke the listed string functions or perform pointer/length operations that could access beyond object bounds. Bitwise operations on epoll_state and simple assignments (e.g., connection->suspended = true) are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
