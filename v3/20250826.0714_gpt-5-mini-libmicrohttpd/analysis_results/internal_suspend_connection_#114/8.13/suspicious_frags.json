  "explanation": "I reported all occurrences in the snippet where pointer values or addresses are used as function parameters or assigned to pointer variables, since Rule 8.13 concerns whether such pointers could (or should) point to const-qualified types. Other parts of the function were not reported because they either do not involve pointers, or they use pointers that are clearly intended to be modified (e.g. list-head/tail/mutex/connection fields that are updated in the function) or pass NULL where no pointee exists. Therefore those remaining fragments do not need investigation for pointer-to-const qualification under Rule 8.13."
