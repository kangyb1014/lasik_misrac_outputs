  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the function parameter itself (the pointer variable). In this function there are no direct assignments to the parameter variable 'connection' (no statements like 'connection = ...'). Most writes in the function modify the object pointed to (e.g. connection->resuming = false; connection->suspended = true; connection->epoll_state &= ...), which is allowed by the rule. Calls to regular functions (e.g. epoll_ctl, MHD_mutex_* functions) pass values or addresses of other objects and cannot reassign the local parameter variable. However, the listed macros/functions that take 'connection' as an argument (XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, EDLL_remove) must be investigated because if they are implemented as macros that reference and assign to the token 'connection' they would perform an assignment to the parameter variable in the caller scope (thus violating Rule 17.8). Therefore those call sites are potentially suspicious and should be checked. All other fragments in the function do not modify the pointer parameter itself and thus do not need further investigation for this rule."
