  "explanation": "I did not include other pointer uses because they either already point to const-qualified types or cannot reasonably be const: - const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data are already const and therefore compliant. - struct MHD_Connection *connection is used with library functions that modify/inspect connection state (e.g. queue_response), so it cannot be trivially made a pointer-to-const. - struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo *auth_info is passed to MHD_free and holds mutable allocations; it cannot be converted to point-to-const without breaking the free/ownership semantics. - struct MHD_Response *response is created and destroyed (MHD_destroy_response), so it must be a pointer to mutable data. - The static int aptr is used as a target for a void* pointer stored in req_cls; that usage justifies non-const storage semantics for the pointed object. - Casts to (const void *) when calling MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static explicitly qualify buffers as const, so those calls are compliant. Therefore only the parameter declarations listed above are plausible candidates for investigation under MISRA C Rule 8.13."
