  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Rule 2.2 defines dead code as any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The statement \"(void) upload_data_size;\" is an evaluated expression statement with no side effects; removing it would not change the program behaviour. Therefore that statement is an instance of dead code under the literal text of Rule 2.2. (Note 2 about unreachable code does not apply because the statement is executed.) Consequently agent A's report is correct. In practice such (void) casts are commonly used to suppress compiler warnings and may be accepted as a documented deviation or replaced by compiler-specific \"unused\" attributes to avoid the Rule 2.2 violation."
