  "explanation": "I examined the entire function for compiler-specific language extensions. The code does not use any of the common documented extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, such as: __attribute__ or __asm__ constructs, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), computed gotos, __extension__, compiler-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific intrinsic syntax. All casts, pointer operations, static local variable, enum use, and (void) casts to silence unused-parameter warnings are standard ISO C. Library-specific identifiers (MHD_*) are API calls, not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for use of language extensions."
