  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario is technically correct in the abstract (calling strcmp with a NULL pointer or a non-NUL-terminated buffer would read out-of-bounds). However, the claim that the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is not correct for this code as used in its intended context. ahc_echo is a libmicrohttpd callback that receives the HTTP method string from the library; the library API guarantees a valid, NUL-terminated method string (i.e. the parameter is non-NULL and properly terminated). Given that contract, strcmp(method, \"GET\") cannot legally dereference a NULL or run past the buffer, so the use does not violate 21.17. The other string-handling uses are similarly protected: the checks compare auth_info->username_len and password_len to the exact strlen of the expected literals before calling memcmp, so memcmp cannot read beyond the provided buffers. If, instead, the function were used in a context where such guarantees do not hold, then the call would be unsafe and should be defended (e.g. check method != NULL and ensure termination). But for the actual library callback contract, there is no MISRA 21.17 violation."
