  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\n```c\nstatic bool\nMHD_lookup_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            const char *header,\n                            size_t header_len,\n                            const char *token,\n                            size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) ||\n      (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0]))\n    return false;\n\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((0 != (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND)) &&\n        (header_len == pos->header_size) &&\n        ( (header == pos->header) ||\n          (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (header,\n                                          pos->header,\n                                          header_len)) ) &&\n        (MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value, token, token_len)))\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) ||\n      (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0]))\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in normal use: the if-test prevents dereferencing NULL or empty strings and returning false changes behavior compared with removing the check (removal could lead to UB or different results). This is therefore not dead code. (A violation scenario would be if every call in the entire project is statically guaranteed to supply non-NULL, non-empty connection/header/token and yet this check is still executed and its outcome never differs \u2014 in that case the check is redundant/unnecessary. However such code would be unreachable rather than 'dead' per the Rule note, and only considered a Rule 2.2 violation if the operation is executed but removable without affecting program behaviour.)"
