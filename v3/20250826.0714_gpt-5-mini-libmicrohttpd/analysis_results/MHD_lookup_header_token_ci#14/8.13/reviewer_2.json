Passing it to a caseless-search function that takes a const char * shows that the member should have been declared const char * (or pos should be a pointer-to-const header). Therefore the pointer in the data structure is not const-qualified where it could be \u2014 a violation of Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to declare a MISRA 8.13 violation. The claim hinges on the declaration of struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (in particular the type of pos->value) and on whether pos->value is modified anywhere else. The snippet shows only read-only uses of pos->value (passed to a function taking const char *), but that alone does not prove the member could not legitimately be a non-const pointer (it may be modified elsewhere, or the struct may be part of APIs that require mutability). MISRA 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified whenever possible across the whole program; determining that \u201cpossible\u201d requires inspecting the struct definition and all uses, not just this single function. Therefore the report is not provably correct from the information given."
