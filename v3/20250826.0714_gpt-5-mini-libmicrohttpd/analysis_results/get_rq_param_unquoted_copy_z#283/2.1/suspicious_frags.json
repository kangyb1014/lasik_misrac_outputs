  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are simple, directly reachable elements (function signature, local variable declaration: \"size_t len;\", and the closing brace). The selected fragments cover the entry assertion, the conditional branch that returns early, the alternative path (call to MHD_str_unquote), the post-call assertions and the final write/return \u2014 these are the places where reachability can be affected (e.g. an always-true/always-false condition, assertions that abort or are compiled out, or a helper that never returns a nonzero length). No other lines in the function introduce potential unreachable code, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1."
