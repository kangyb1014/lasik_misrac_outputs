  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_get_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline unsigned int\ndigest_get_size (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment returns MD5_DIGEST_SIZE when da->algo equals MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5; removing it would change behavior whenever MD5 is a selectable algorithm at runtime, so it is not dead. (It would only be dead if MD5 support is compiled in but the codebase guarantees da->algo can never equal the MD5 value\u2014e.g. no code ever sets that value or build configuration makes that value unreachable.)"
