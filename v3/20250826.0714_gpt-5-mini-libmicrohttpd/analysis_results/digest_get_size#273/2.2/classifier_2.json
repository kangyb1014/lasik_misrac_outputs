Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_get_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline unsigned int\ndigest_get_size (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The final \"return 0;\" is reachable if the function falls through past the algorithm checks (e.g. none of the MHD_*_SUPPORT macros are defined or the da->algo does not match any tested value) or when mhd_assert is a no-op in production builds (asserts compiled out). Removing this return would change program behaviour (and could leave the function without a return), so it is not dead code. Note that if mhd_assert(0) unconditionally aborts, the return would be unreachable in that build, but unreachable code is not considered dead code by the rule."
