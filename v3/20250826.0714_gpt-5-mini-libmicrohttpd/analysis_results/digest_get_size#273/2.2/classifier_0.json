Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_get_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline unsigned int\ndigest_get_size (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The if-return returns SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE when da->algo == MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256. If SHA256 support is compiled in and the algorithm can be selected at runtime, this branch is executed and its removal would change program behaviour, so it is not dead. The only way this could be irrelevant is if the SHA256 value can never occur at runtime (making the code unreachable) \u2014 unreachable code is not classified as dead code by the rule."
