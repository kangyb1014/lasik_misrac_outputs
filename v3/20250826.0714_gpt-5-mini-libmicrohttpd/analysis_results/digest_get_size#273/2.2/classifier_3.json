Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_get_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline unsigned int\ndigest_get_size (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n    return MD5_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_SHA512_256 == da->algo)\n    return SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE;\n#endif /* MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT */\n  mhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0); /* May not happen */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The mhd_assert(0) is a defensive check for an impossible state (or, if truly impossible, is unreachable) and therefore is not dead code. In builds with assertions enabled it changes behaviour (it traps), so its removal would affect behaviour; when unreachable it is not 'dead code' per Note 2. (A violation would arise only if the assert macro were a no-op in all builds and the call were actually executed in normal operation, in which case removal would not affect behaviour.)"
