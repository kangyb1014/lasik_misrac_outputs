  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (in conditionals/loops). In this function there are no loops and the only controlling expressions are the three 'if' conditions comparing da->algo to constant algorithm identifiers; those are therefore the relevant fragments to investigate for potential invariance (for example, due to configuration macros making only one branch available or da->algo being effectively constant). Other lines do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: the mhd_assert(...) calls are diagnostic/runtime-check macros rather than control-flow constructs governed by Rule 14.3, the final mhd_assert(0) is a diagnostic/assertion (not a controlling expression of a conditional/loop), and the return statements are ordinary flow exits. Preprocessor guards simply include or exclude the corresponding if-blocks at compile time and do not by themselves create additional controlling expressions to inspect here."
