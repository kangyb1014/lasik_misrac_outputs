The comparison has no side effects and (given the API contract) will always be true, so the check is redundant. Because it is an operation that, when executed (e.g. in debug builds), can be removed without affecting program behaviour, it constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert(...) call is an explicit runtime diagnostic check (via a macro) that can have observable behaviour in builds where asserts are enabled (typically abort/log on failure). Rule 2.2 forbids code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Removing an assertion that can abort or otherwise report an invariant violation would change program behaviour in those builds, so it is not dead code in general. Even if, by API contract, the condition should always hold, that does not automatically make the check dead \u2014 it is a defensive diagnostic used to detect contract violations. Also, whether the macro expands to nothing in some build configurations does not by itself make the source line \u201cdead code\u201d for the project: the check is conditionally active and can affect behaviour when enabled. Therefore the agent A\u2019s claim that this assertion constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is unjustified."
