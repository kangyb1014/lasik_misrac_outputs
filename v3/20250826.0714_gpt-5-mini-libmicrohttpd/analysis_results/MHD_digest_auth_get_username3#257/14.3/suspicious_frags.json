  "explanation": "I focused on all controlling expressions (if statements and assertion macros) because MISRA C Rule 14.3 applies to control expressions. The listed fragments are every conditional or assert-like controlling expression present in the function source. Other code parts were not included because they are not control statements (they are declarations, assignments, function calls, casts, a (void) cast to suppress warnings, allocation, pointer arithmetic, or simple returns) and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 14.3. No loop or switch control expressions are present in this function beyond the listed conditionals/asserts, so there are no additional control expressions to inspect for invariance."
