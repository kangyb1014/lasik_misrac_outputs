  "explanation": "I did not find any explicit compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, _Pragma, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- The leading identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name in the source, not an explicit language extension token in this fragment; its expansion is not shown here, so it cannot be flagged as an extension based solely on this code. If the macro expands to a compiler-specific extension, that expansion would need to be inspected in its definition.\n- Standard C constructs are used: casts, pointer arithmetic (uname_info + 1), standard types (size_t, uint8_t), and standard library-like calls (calloc/free). The (void) unif_buf_used cast and the assert-like mhd_assert use are common idioms and not language extensions in themselves.\n\nIf you want me to inspect macro definitions (e.g., _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_calloc_, mhd_assert) or included headers to see whether they expand to compiler-specific extensions, provide those definitions and I will re-check them."
