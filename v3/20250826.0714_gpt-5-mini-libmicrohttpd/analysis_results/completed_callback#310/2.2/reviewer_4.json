  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three lines \u201c(void) cls; (void) connection; (void) toe;\u201d are the common idiom used to indicate intentionally unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings. They do not constitute meaningful runtime actions with observable side\u2011effects; compilers typically produce no code for them. Rule 2.2 targets truly dead operations whose executed presence would be redundant in the sense of having been executed and yet removable without affecting program behaviour. In practice (and in MISRA guidance and common practice) the explicit void\u2011cast for unused parameters is an accepted way to document intent and silence warnings and is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation. If you want to avoid the casts you can omit parameter names where the signature permits it or use a project\u2011approved UNUSED/ANNOTATION macro, but the mere presence of \u201c(void) toe;\u201d is not correctly reported as a Rule 2.2 breach."
