  "scenario": "The parameter 'void *cls' is unused and not modified, so in isolation it could be declared 'const void *cls'. However this function is an implementation of an external callback prototype (libmicrohttpd) that requires 'void *cls' and therefore the function signature cannot be changed. Because the non-const pointer is mandated by the external API, this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If this were an internal function whose prototype could be changed, using 'void *' would be a violation and should be changed to 'const void *'.)"
