  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. Analysis by parameter:\n- cls: only cast to (void) to suppress unused warnings \u2014 not modified.\n- connection: only cast to (void) to suppress unused warnings \u2014 not modified.\n- toe: only cast to (void) to suppress unused warnings \u2014 not modified.\n- req_cls: only read (dereferenced) to obtain a local pointer tv (struct timeval *tv = *req_cls;). The code frees the object pointed to by *req_cls via free(tv), which modifies the object referred to by the pointer (allowed by the rule), but it does not assign to req_cls or to *req_cls. There are no assignments to any parameter variable (no req_cls = ..., no *req_cls = ..., no cls = ..., etc.).\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing further needs investigation regarding modification of function parameters."
