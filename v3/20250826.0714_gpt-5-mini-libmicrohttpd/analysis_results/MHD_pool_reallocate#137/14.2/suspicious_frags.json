  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loops are present in the provided function body (no 'for' tokens). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and their clauses; as there are no for statements here, there are no in-function fragments to investigate for this rule. Note: some identifiers used (macros or called functions such as ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, memcpy, memset, etc.) could expand or be implemented elsewhere and might contain for-loops \u2014 those definitions are not part of the provided code and therefore are outside the scope of this fragment. If you want checking of for-loop well-formedness in those macros/functions, please supply their definitions so they can be reviewed."
