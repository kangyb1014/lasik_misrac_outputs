  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code contains calls to memcpy and memset (which copy and set memory, not compare it), assertion macros (mhd_assert), address/offset helper macros/functions (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_), and ASAN-related macros (_MHD_POISON_MEMORY, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, __asan_region_is_poisoned). None of these are string-comparison functions, and there is no call to strcmp, strncmp, or memcmp in the supplied code fragment. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this function."
