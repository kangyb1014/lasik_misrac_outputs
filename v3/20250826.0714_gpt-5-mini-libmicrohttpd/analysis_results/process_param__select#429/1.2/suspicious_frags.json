  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The snippet contains only standard C constructs: function with static storage, an enum return type, const char * parameter, standard library I/O (fprintf, stderr), logical negation (! 0) which yields 1 in standard C, and the conditional (?:) operator. There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions (GNU ({...})), pragma or builtin functions, Microsoft-specific keywords, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
