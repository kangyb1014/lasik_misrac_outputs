  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is an assignment, not a controlling expression. It simply sets tool_params.select to the value of !0 (constant 1). Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions; this use does not violate it. (If the same invariant expression were used as a controlling expression \u2014 e.g. if (!0) { \u2026 } \u2014 that would be an invariant controlling expression and would violate Rule 14.3 unless one of the documented exceptions applied.)"
