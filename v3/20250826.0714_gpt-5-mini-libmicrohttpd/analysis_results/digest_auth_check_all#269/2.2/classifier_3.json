  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_auth_check_all:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_DigestAuthResult\ndigest_auth_check_all (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       const char *realm,\n                       const char *username,\n                       const char *password,\n                       const uint8_t *userdigest,\n                       unsigned int nonce_timeout,\n                       uint32_t max_nc,\n                       enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiQOP mqop,\n                       enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3 malgo3)\n{\n  enum MHD_DigestAuthResult res;\n  char *buf;\n  struct DigestAlgorithm da;\n\n  buf = NULL;\n  digest_setup_zero (&da);\n  if (0 == nonce_timeout)\n    nonce_timeout = connection->daemon->dauth_def_nonce_timeout;\n  if (0 == max_nc)\n    max_nc = connection->daemon->dauth_def_max_nc;\n  res = digest_auth_check_all_inner (connection, realm, username, password,\n                                     userdigest,\n                                     nonce_timeout,\n                                     max_nc, mqop, malgo3,\n                                     &buf, &da);\n  digest_deinit (&da);\n  if (NULL != buf)\n    free (buf);\n\n  return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nchar *buf;\n\n  buf = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment 'buf = NULL;' is not dead. buf is passed by address to digest_auth_check_all_inner(&buf) and later conditionally freed (if (NULL != buf) free(buf)). If the initialization were removed, buf would be indeterminate and the behavior (possible UB or an incorrect free) could change. Therefore removing the assignment would affect program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
