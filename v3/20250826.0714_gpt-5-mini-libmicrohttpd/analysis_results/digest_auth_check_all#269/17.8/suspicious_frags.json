  "explanation": "The two fragments above modify the function parameters nonce_timeout and max_nc and therefore should be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Other code in the function does not modify any parameter itself: connection, realm, username, password and userdigest (pointer parameters) are only read and not reassigned; buf and da are local variables (buf initialized to NULL and da set up/deinitialized locally) and may be modified or passed by address to inner functions \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed, but no pointer parameter itself is reassigned in this function. The calls to digest_auth_check_all_inner, digest_setup_zero, digest_deinit and free operate on local objects or passed-in pointers without reassigning the function's pointer parameters, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
