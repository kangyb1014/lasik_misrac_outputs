  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in this function. The code uses standard C constructs: function and enum declarations, pointers, standard fixed-width integer types (uint8_t, uint32_t from <stdint.h>), NULL, dynamic memory free(), and ordinary control flow. There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, inline assembly, attribute((...)), designated initializers beyond standard C, or other vendor-specific keywords. All local declarations appear at the top of the function (acceptable in all C standards), and comparisons like 0 == nonce_timeout are ordinary expressions, not extensions. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
