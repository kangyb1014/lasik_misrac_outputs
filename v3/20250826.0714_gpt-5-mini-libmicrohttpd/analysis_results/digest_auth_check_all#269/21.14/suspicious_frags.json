  "explanation": "The provided function body contains no direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp; there are only variable declarations, numeric comparisons against 0, calls to digest_setup_zero, digest_deinit, free, and the call to digest_auth_check_all_inner. The only place where null-terminated strings (username, password, realm) are forwarded and could potentially be compared via memcmp is the call to digest_auth_check_all_inner \u2014 therefore that call site is reported for investigation. All other fragments in this function do not use memcmp and do not perform string comparisons, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and need not be investigated here."
