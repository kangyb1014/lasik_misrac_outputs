Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_uint8_to_str_pad:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_uint8_to_str_pad (uint8_t val,\n                      uint8_t min_digits,\n                      char *buf,\n                      size_t buf_size)\n{\n  size_t pos; /**< the position of the current printed digit */\n  int digit;\n  mhd_assert (3 >= min_digits);\n  if (0 == buf_size)\n    return 0;\n\n  pos = 0;\n  digit = val / 100;\n  if (0 == digit)\n  {\n    if (3 <= min_digits)\n      buf[pos++] = '0';\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) digit);\n    val %= 100;\n    min_digits = 2;\n  }\n\n  if (buf_size <= pos)\n    return 0;\n  digit = val / 10;\n  if (0 == digit)\n  {\n    if (2 <= min_digits)\n      buf[pos++] = '0';\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) digit);\n    val %= 10;\n  }\n\n  if (buf_size <= pos)\n    return 0;\n  buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) val);\n  return pos;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nbuf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) digit);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Example: call MHD_uint8_to_str_pad(123, 1, buf, 10). In this case digit is 1 in the hundreds branch, so the statement buf[pos++] = (char)('0' + (char) digit); is executed, writing '1' into buf[0] and incrementing pos. Removing that assignment would change the buffer contents and the returned pos, so the operation is not dead code."
