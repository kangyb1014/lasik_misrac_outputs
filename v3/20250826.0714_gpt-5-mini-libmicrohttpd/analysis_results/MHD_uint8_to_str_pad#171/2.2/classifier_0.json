Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_uint8_to_str_pad:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_uint8_to_str_pad (uint8_t val,\n                      uint8_t min_digits,\n                      char *buf,\n                      size_t buf_size)\n{\n  size_t pos; /**< the position of the current printed digit */\n  int digit;\n  mhd_assert (3 >= min_digits);\n  if (0 == buf_size)\n    return 0;\n\n  pos = 0;\n  digit = val / 100;\n  if (0 == digit)\n  {\n    if (3 <= min_digits)\n      buf[pos++] = '0';\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) digit);\n    val %= 100;\n    min_digits = 2;\n  }\n\n  if (buf_size <= pos)\n    return 0;\n  digit = val / 10;\n  if (0 == digit)\n  {\n    if (2 <= min_digits)\n      buf[pos++] = '0';\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) digit);\n    val %= 10;\n  }\n\n  if (buf_size <= pos)\n    return 0;\n  buf[pos++] = (char) ('0' + (char) val);\n  return pos;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmin_digits = 2;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment is required to force tens-digit padding after a non-zero hundreds digit. Example: val=101, min_digits=1, buf_size large. With the assignment (min_digits=2) the function produces \"101\" (hundreds '1', tens '0', ones '1'). If the assignment is removed, min_digits remains 1 so the tens '0' is not emitted and the function would produce \"11\". Removing the assignment would therefore change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
