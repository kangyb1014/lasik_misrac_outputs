  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C constructs only: fixed-width integer types (uint8_t), size_t, plain function definition, integer arithmetic, conditional statements, casts, and returns. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__/@inline (compiler-specific variants), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, designated GCC/Clang builtins, anonymous structs/unions with nonstandard syntax, or other documented vendor extensions. The mhd_assert identifier is a macro invocation but macros themselves are standard C preprocessor features; its definition is not shown here, so if it uses a compiler extension that should be checked where it is defined. Based on the shown code alone, there are no language extensions to report."
