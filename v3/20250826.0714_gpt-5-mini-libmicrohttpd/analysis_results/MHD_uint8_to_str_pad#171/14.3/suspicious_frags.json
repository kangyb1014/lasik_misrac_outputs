  "explanation": "I did not find any controlling expressions that are invariant across all possible function invocations. Reasoning by control construct:\n\n- if (0 == buf_size): buf_size is a function parameter; its value is not constant, so the condition is not invariant.\n- if (0 == digit) (first occurrence): digit is computed as val / 100 (val is a parameter), so the expression depends on val and is not invariant.\n- if (3 <= min_digits): min_digits is a parameter constrained by mhd_assert(3 >= min_digits) (i.e. min_digits <= 3). That assertion does not make 3 <= min_digits always true or always false across all valid inputs \u2014 the expression can be true when min_digits == 3 and false otherwise \u2014 so it is not an invariant.\n- if (buf_size <= pos) (both occurrences): pos is modified at runtime; buf_size is a parameter. The relation can vary at runtime, so not invariant.\n- if (0 == digit) (second occurrence): digit is computed as val / 10 and depends on val; not invariant.\n- if (2 <= min_digits): min_digits is a parameter; while the earlier code may assign min_digits = 2 in one branch, that does not make the controlling expression invariant across all executions of the function (it can be both true or false depending on the initial parameter and path).\n\nNo loop constructs are present (so the allowed infinite-loop exception is not relevant). Therefore there are no control expressions that are statically or semantically invariant and requiring further MISRA Rule 14.3 investigation."
