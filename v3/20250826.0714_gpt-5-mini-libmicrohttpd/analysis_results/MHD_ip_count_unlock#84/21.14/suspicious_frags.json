  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any string comparison operations is present in the provided function. The function only calls mhd_assert, conditionally calls MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, and otherwise performs a (void) cast on daemon. There are no references to char pointers, string literals, or functions that compare null-terminated strings (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) in this fragment or in either preprocessor branch, so nothing here needs investigation for Rule 21.14."
