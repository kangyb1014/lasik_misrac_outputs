  "explanation": "Other parts of the snippet do not need investigation for unreachable-code Rule 2.1. The function signature and storage-class/return-type (static void MHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)) are declarations, not executable statements that can be unreachable. The preprocessor directives (#if/#else/#endif) are compilation-time controls that only select between the already-listed executable statements; the directives themselves are not executable code. The braces and function end are syntactic delimiters and contain no additional executable statements. There are no other executable statements or branches in the function besides the three lines listed above, so no further fragments need to be investigated for potential unreachable code."
