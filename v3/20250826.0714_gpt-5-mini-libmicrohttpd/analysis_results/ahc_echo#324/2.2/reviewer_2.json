  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines such as '(void) version;' are the common idiom to explicitly reference an unused parameter to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 prohibits dead code \u2014 operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 but that rule is intended to catch genuinely unused/abandoned code (unreachable blocks, unused functions/variables that have no effect on runtime). The (void)cast is an explicit reference to the parameter; it may affect evaluation/timing in constrained embedded contexts and serves a semantic purpose (documentation and suppression of diagnostics). In practice MISRA guidance accepts this idiom for marking unused parameters. Therefore the claim that this is a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
