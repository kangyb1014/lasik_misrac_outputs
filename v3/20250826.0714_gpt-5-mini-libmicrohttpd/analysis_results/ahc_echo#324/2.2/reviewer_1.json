Its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. To comply, either remove the unused parameter, omit its name in the function prototype/definition, or use an approved MISRA-compliant pattern to indicate an intentionally unused parameter (e.g. a dedicated UNUSED_PARAM macro that expands appropriately).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The three lines such as '(void) cls;' are expression statements with no side effects; they are executed at runtime but their removal does not change the program\u2019s observable behaviour, so by the text of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 they meet the definition of dead code. These statements are reachable and executed (so Note 2 does not apply), and they are not initializations (so Note 3 does not apply). To comply you should remove the unused parameter name from the function signature, use a compiler/implementation mechanism such as an 'unused' attribute, or adopt an approved project-wide pattern (or record an accepted deviation) rather than leaving no-op casts in place."
