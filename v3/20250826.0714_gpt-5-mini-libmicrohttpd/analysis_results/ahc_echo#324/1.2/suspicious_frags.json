  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for uses of compiler/language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (e.g. GNU/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_*, compiler pragmas for extensions, vendor-specific keywords, or other non-standard tokens). None are present in this snippet. Specific observations:\n\n- No double-underscore or vendor-prefixed keywords (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__) are used.\n- No GNU extensions such as statement-expressions, nested functions, or typeof are present.\n- No inline assembler or compiler pragmas appear in the source shown.\n- All casts and types (e.g. (uint64_t)) are standard C/stdint usage, and no nonstandard syntactic constructs are used.\n- Library/POSIX calls (open, fstat, close, abort, strstr, strcmp, strlen) are standard POSIX/C library usage, not language extensions in source code. If any of the MHD_* identifiers expand to compiler-specific extensions via their headers, that would be outside this translation unit and should be checked in those headers; the code shown does not itself invoke language extensions.\n\nTherefore I did not identify any code fragments in the provided snippet that should be investigated for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you want, I can also scan any included headers or macro definitions for extensions."
