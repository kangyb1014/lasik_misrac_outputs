  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect calls of a function to itself. The shown fragments are potentially involved in indirect re-entry of the ahc_echo callback and therefore warrant investigation: the req_cls handshake (setting *req_cls and returning MHD_YES, and resetting it) controls the request lifecycle and may cause the caller to re-invoke the callback for the same request; creation/queueing/destroying of MHD responses (MHD_create_response_*, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) are library interactions that may, depending on the library implementation, invoke callbacks or trigger re-entrancy into the registered request handler. Other code fragments (strcmp, strstr, open, fstat, close, strlen, abort, variable declarations, and simple assignments/returns) are plain library or system calls, local state manipulations, or control-flow statements that do not by themselves cause callback re-entry and therefore do not need investigation for indirect recursion in the context of Rule 17.2."
