  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function appears to call list_directory (directly or indirectly). The function body contains only calls to standard library functions: opendir, readdir, snprintf, stat, realloc and closedir. None of these are callback-based APIs nor do they accept function pointers that could lead to an indirect call back into list_directory. There are no calls to user-defined functions, no function-pointer invocations, and no explicit call to list_directory itself. The rdc parameter is used only as a data structure (buffer/length/offset) and not invoked as a function. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion in this code and no fragments require investigation for MISRA C Rule 17.2."
