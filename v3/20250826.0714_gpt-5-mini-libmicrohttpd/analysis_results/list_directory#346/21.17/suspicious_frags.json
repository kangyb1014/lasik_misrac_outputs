  "explanation": "All flagged fragments are places where formatted string output (snprintf) and buffer-size management occur and therefore need to be checked for potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes (return-value handling, type casts, integer overflow and one\u2011past\u2011end pointer issues). Other code fragments do not use string\u2011handling functions or do not influence the bounds of objects passed to those functions: opendir()/readdir()/closedir() calls manage directory traversal, the S_ISREG(stat) check and stat() call operate on filesystem metadata, the check if ('.' == de->d_name[0]) only examines the first character of a nul\u2011terminated directory name (no strcpy/strcat/etc. used), and the final return statements do not affect buffer accesses. Therefore only the shown snprintf/size\u2011check/realloc related fragments require investigation for compliance with the rule."
