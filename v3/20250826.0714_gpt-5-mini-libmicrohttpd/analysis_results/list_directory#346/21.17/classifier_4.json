  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to snprintf passes the destination &rdc->buf[rdc->off] together with the explicit remaining size rdc->buf_len - rdc->off, so snprintf cannot write more bytes than the provided size. The code checks the return value (res) and skips updating rdc->off if res indicates truncation (rdc->buf_len - rdc->off <= (size_t)res) or error (res <= 0). fullname and de->d_name are NUL-terminated (fullname was produced with a checked snprintf earlier; de->d_name is provided by readdir), so there is no out\u2011of\u2011bounds read of those strings. Note: a borderline case is when rdc->off == rdc->buf_len so the pointer is one\u2011past\u2011the\u2011end and the size argument is 0; per the C standard snprintf with n==0 may be called with a null or one\u2011past pointer and will not write, so this does not produce an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access either."
