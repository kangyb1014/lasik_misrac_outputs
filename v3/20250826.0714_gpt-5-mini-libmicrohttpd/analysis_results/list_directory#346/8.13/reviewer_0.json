True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer 'de' is declared as 'struct dirent *de;' but in the function it is only used for read-only access (de->d_name, etc.). It could be declared as 'const struct dirent *de;', and assigning the result of readdir (which returns 'struct dirent *') to a 'const struct dirent *' is allowed. Therefore the code does not qualify the pointer as const when it could, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer shall point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In this function the variable de is only read (de->d_name is inspected and used in snprintf/stat calls) and never used to modify the dirent object, so it can and should be declared const struct dirent *de. Assigning the result of readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to a pointer-to-const is allowed (you are adding const qualification). Therefore the code as written fails to apply const where possible and violates Rule 8.13. (Note: when fixing, be aware of any other MISRA rules about passing pointers through variadic functions; that is a separate concern.)"
