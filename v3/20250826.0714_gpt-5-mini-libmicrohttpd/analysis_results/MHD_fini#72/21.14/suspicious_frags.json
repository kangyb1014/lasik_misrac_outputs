  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The MHD_fini function contains only conditional calls to gnutls_global_deinit(), WSACleanup() and MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish(), and preprocessor directives. There is no use of the Standard Library function memcmp, no string handling or comparison of null-terminated strings, and no memory comparison operations in the provided code. Macros or external functions called here (gnutls_global_deinit, WSACleanup, MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish) are outside the supplied fragment and therefore not part of this analysis; within the given code there is nothing that could expand to or call memcmp, so no further fragments need investigation for Rule 21.14."
