  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific notes:\n- The function definition syntax (void MHD_fini (void) { ... }) uses standard C; the line break and spacing are ordinary formatting, not an extension.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT, #if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS), #endif) and the defined operator are part of standard C preprocessing, not compiler extensions.\n- The calls to gnutls_global_deinit(), WSACleanup(), and MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish() are ordinary function calls to external/library APIs; their presence does not imply use of a language extension.\n- C-style comments (/* ... */) are standard.\n- There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension tokens (for example __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords).\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
