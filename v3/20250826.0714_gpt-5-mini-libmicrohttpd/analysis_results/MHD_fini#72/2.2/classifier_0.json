  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_fini:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_fini (void)\n{\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  gnutls_global_deinit ();\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSACleanup ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Cannot determine from this single call alone. The call MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish() is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 only if it has no observable effect (for example the function is an empty/no-op routine or its side effects do not influence program behaviour); in that case the call is dead code because removing it would not change program behaviour. If, however, the function performs cleanup, updates state, stops timers, or otherwise affects program behaviour or timing, the call is not dead code and does not violate Rule 2.2."
