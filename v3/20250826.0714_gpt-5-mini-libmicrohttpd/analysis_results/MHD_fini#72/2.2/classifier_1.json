  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_fini:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_fini (void)\n{\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  gnutls_global_deinit ();\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSACleanup ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSACleanup ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the normal case: when MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS is defined the call to WSACleanup() performs observable cleanup (closing Winsock resources), so removing it would change program behaviour. A violation could occur only in a special configuration where WSACleanup is defined as a no\u2011op (e.g. an empty macro or a stub that has no observable effects); in that case the executed call would be dead code because its removal would not affect program behaviour."
