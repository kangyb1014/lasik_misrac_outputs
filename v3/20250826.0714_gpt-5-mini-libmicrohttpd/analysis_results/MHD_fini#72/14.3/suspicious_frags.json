  "explanation": "The function contains no C control statements (no if, for, while, do-while, or switch) whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The only conditional constructs present are preprocessor directives (#ifdef / #if defined / #endif), which are evaluated at preprocessing time and are not subject to MISRA C Rule 14.3 (which targets runtime controlling expressions). All remaining lines are simple function calls and thus cannot violate the rule. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 14.3."
