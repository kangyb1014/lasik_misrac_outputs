  "explanation": "No other fragments in this function appear to be unreachable. The single unconditional call MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish() is executed whenever MHD_fini() is called, so it is not unreachable. The function signature, brace pairs and comments contain no executable code and therefore cannot be unreachable. The only parts that merit investigation with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 are the conditional compilation blocks (shown above), since conditional compilation can produce build variants where code is present but not executed; all other lines in this function do not exhibit characteristics of unreachable code."
