  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. The while condition while (quoted_len > r) depends on r, which is initialized to 0 and is modified inside the loop via ++r and r++; therefore the controlling expression is not constant/invariant. The if ('\\\\' == quoted[r]) test depends on quoted[r] and r (which changes), so it is not invariant. The nested if (quoted_len == r) is evaluated after ++r and likewise depends on the changing r value. The allowed exceptions for Rule 14.3 (infinite loops or the do-while integer-constant exception) do not apply here. Consequently there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
