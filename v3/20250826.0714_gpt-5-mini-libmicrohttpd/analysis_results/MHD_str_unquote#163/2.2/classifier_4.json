Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_unquote:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_unquote (const char *quoted,\n                 size_t quoted_len,\n                 char *result)\n{\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n\n  while (quoted_len > r)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[r])\n    {\n      ++r;\n      if (quoted_len == r)\n        return 0; /* Last backslash is not followed by char to unescape */\n    }\n    result[w++] = quoted[r++];\n  }\n  return w;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n++r;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. ++r is executed when the current character is a backslash to skip the escape; removing it would change program behaviour. Example: for input consisting of a backslash followed by 'n' (two chars), with ++r the function produces \"n\" (length 1); without ++r the backslash would be copied into result, producing a different output and length."
