  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the subscript quoted[r] is executed only when r < quoted_len due to the enclosing while (quoted_len > r). The fragment does not call any <string.h> function. (A potential unrelated error would occur if quoted == NULL and quoted_len > 0, which would dereference a null pointer \u2014 but that is not a string.h usage and not a Rule 21.17 violation.)"
