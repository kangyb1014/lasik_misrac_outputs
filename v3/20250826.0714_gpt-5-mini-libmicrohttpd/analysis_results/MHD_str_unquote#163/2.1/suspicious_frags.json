  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are unreachable. Reasoning: all statements can be reached depending on inputs. The initializations of r and w are reachable. The while loop body is executed when quoted_len > r. Inside the loop, the backslash branch (++r and the subsequent check) can be taken and the return 0 is reachable when the final character is a backslash. The assignment result[w++] = quoted[r++] is reachable whenever the loop condition holds and the backslash-case does not cause an immediate return (i.e., when there is a character to unescape). The final return w is reached when the loop terminates normally. There are no constructs (e.g., preceding unconditional return or goto) that make any of these statements unreachable, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
