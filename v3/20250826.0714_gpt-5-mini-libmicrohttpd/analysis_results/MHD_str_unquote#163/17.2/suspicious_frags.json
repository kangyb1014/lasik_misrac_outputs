  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function MHD_str_unquote contains no function calls (no direct calls, no calls via function pointers, and no macro-expanded calls), and it does not reference its own name or take its address. There is therefore no direct or indirect recursion visible in this code fragment, so no parts need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 compliance."
