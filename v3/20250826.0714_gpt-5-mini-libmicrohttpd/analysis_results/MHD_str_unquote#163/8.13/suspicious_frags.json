  "explanation": "No pointer in this function should be further const-qualified. The input pointer 'quoted' is already declared as const char * (correct). The only other pointer parameter is 'result' (char *), which is written to via result[w++] = ...; so it must be a non-const pointer and therefore should not be const-qualified. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning constructs in this function. Consequently, there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
