  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Neither function parameter is modified in this function: \n- The pointer parameter 'daemon' is only used as an argument to MHD_get_timeout64; the pointer variable itself is not assigned to or altered (the callee may modify the object it points to, which is allowed). \n- The scalar parameter 'max_timeout' is only read in assertions, comparisons and returned; there are no assignments to it. \n- Taking the address of a local variable (&d_timeout) and passing it to a function does not modify any parameter. \nCasts and comparisons (e.g. (uint64_t) max_timeout) are read-only operations and do not violate the rule."
