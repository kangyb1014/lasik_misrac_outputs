Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of BASE64Encode:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nBASE64Encode (const void *in, size_t len, char **output)\n{\n#define FILLCHAR '='\n  const char *cvt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n                    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n                    \"0123456789+/\";\n  const char *data = in;\n  char *opt;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t i;\n  char c;\n  ret = 0;\n\n  opt = malloc (2 + (len * 4 / 3) + 8);\n  if (NULL == opt)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    c = (data[i] >> 2) & 0x3F;\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    c = (data[i] << 4) & 0x3F;\n    if (++i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F));\n    }\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] << 2) & 0x3F));\n      if (++i < len)\n      {\n        c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 6) & 0x03));\n      }\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      ++i;\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = data[i] & 0x3F;\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n  }\n  *output = opt;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (++i < len)\n{\n  c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F));\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "For input with at least 2 bytes (e.g. len == 2, initial i == 0) the ++i < len test is true and the assignment c = (char)(c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F)); is executed to form the second 6\u2011bit group of Base64 output. Removing this operation would change the produced Base64 string, so it is not dead code."
