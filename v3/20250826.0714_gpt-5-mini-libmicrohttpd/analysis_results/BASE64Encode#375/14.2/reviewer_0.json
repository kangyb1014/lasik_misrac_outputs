First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of BASE64Encode.\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nBASE64Encode (const void *in, size_t len, char **output)\n{\n#define FILLCHAR '='\n  const char *cvt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n                    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n                    \"0123456789+/\";\n  const char *data = in;\n  char *opt;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t i;\n  char c;\n  ret = 0;\n\n  opt = malloc (2 + (len * 4 / 3) + 8);\n  if (NULL == opt)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    c = (data[i] >> 2) & 0x3F;\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    c = (data[i] << 4) & 0x3F;\n    if (++i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F));\n    }\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] << 2) & 0x3F));\n      if (++i < len)\n      {\n        c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 6) & 0x03));\n      }\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      ++i;\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = data[i] & 0x3F;\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n  }\n  *output = opt;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop uses 'i' as the loop counter (for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)). The fragment 'if (++i < len)' increments the loop counter inside the loop body, causing a persistent side effect on the loop counter. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the loop counter not be modified in the for-loop body (it must only be modified by the third clause), so this violates Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires that a for loop have a single loop counter that is initialized in the first clause, tested in the second clause (with no persistent side effects), and modified only in the third clause; the loop counter must not be modified in the loop body. In the shown code the loop header uses i as the loop counter (for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)), but the loop body also modifies i (e.g. the expression if (++i < len) and the ++i in the else branch). Those increments are persistent side effects on the loop counter inside the loop body, so the for loop is not well-formed per Rule 14.2. (The second clause itself has no side effects, so the violation arises from modifications of i inside the loop body.)"
