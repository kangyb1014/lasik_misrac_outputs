  "explanation": "I inspected the entire BASE64Encode implementation and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (nor any other string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp). The code only performs byte-wise indexing into the cvt lookup string and arithmetic on input bytes; it does not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this function."
