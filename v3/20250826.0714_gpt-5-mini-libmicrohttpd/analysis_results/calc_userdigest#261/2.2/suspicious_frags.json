Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have flagged all executable statements inside the function for investigation because each call could potentially be a no-op, be compiled out, or otherwise be executed while having no effect on observable program behaviour (which would make it dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2). The remaining parts of the snippet \u2014 the function declaration (return type, name, parameter list), parameter declarations, and braces \u2014 are non-executable syntactic elements and therefore not candidates for dead code. Also note that initialization (there are no initializers here) and unreachable code (none present in this fragment) are not considered dead code per the rule notes, so they do not need investigation in this snippet."
