  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userdigest:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userdigest (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                 const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n                 const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n                 const char *password,\n                 uint8_t *ha1_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update_str (da, password);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, ha1_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigest_update_str (da, password);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call to digest_update_str(da, password) contributes the password bytes to the HA1 computation. Removing it would change the computed digest (and thus program behaviour), so it is not dead code. (Only in a pathological case where password is an empty string and digest_update_str is a guaranteed no-op would its removal have no effect.)"
