  "explanation": "No selection or iteration statements are present in the submitted function: there are no if, switch, for, while, or do-while constructs whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The only statement that resembles a Boolean expression is the macro call mhd_assert(! da->hashing); this is a macro invocation, not a source-level controlling statement. (If the macro expands to a controlling statement, that expansion is outside the provided code fragment and cannot be investigated here.) All other lines are simple function calls and expression evaluations and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
