  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in the provided function that are statically unreachable. The function consists of a straight-line sequence of calls with no conditional constructs, early returns, unreachable labels, or constant false/true branches that would make any statements impossible to execute. The only macro-like token is mhd_assert(! da->hashing); this is a runtime assertion (or may be a build-time no-op depending on configuration) and does not introduce statically unreachable code in the snippet shown \u2014 at worst it causes a runtime abort when the assertion fails, which does not violate MISRA Rule 2.1 (which targets code that can never be executed). Similarly, the inline/static decoration and the repeated digest_update_with_colon calls do not create unreachable code. If needed, reviewers may wish to inspect the definitions of mhd_assert and the digest_update* functions for complex macro expansions that could introduce unreachable code elsewhere, but within this function there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
