  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned or otherwise modified within calc_userdigest. Analysis by parameter:\n- da (struct DigestAlgorithm *): only dereferenced (da->hashing) and passed to helper functions. The pointer variable da itself is not assigned to or modified. Modifying the object *da via helper calls is permitted by Rule 17.8.\n- username, realm, password (const char *): passed to digest_update / digest_update_str and not reassigned; they are const pointers to const data, so their pointees cannot be modified here and the pointer variables themselves are not changed.\n- username_len, realm_len (size_t): used as arguments and not assigned to; no modification.\n- ha1_bin (uint8_t *): passed to digest_calc_hash which may modify the object pointed to by ha1_bin (allowed), but the pointer ha1_bin itself is not reassigned in this function.\n\nAll parameter uses are reads or passing to other functions; there are no assignments like parameter = ... or increments/decrements of parameter variables. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
