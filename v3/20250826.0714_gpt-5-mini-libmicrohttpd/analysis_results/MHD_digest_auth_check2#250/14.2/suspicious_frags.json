First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and the three clauses of a for loop. The provided function contains no for statements (no explicit for keywords) and no constructs that act as for loops within this translation unit. The only control flow constructs present are if/else-if/else and function calls/macro invocations (MHD_PANIC, MHD_digest_auth_check3). Since there are no for loops in this code fragment, there are no pieces here that need to be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.2. Note: if any of the called functions or macros (e.g. MHD_PANIC or MHD_digest_auth_check3) expand to or contain for loops, those loops would need to be examined in their own definitions/translation units; however, those definitions are not part of the provided code fragment and therefore are outside the scope of this review."
