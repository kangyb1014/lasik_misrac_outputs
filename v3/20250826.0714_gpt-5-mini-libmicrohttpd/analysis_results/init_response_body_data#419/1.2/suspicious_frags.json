  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. The code only uses standard ISO C constructs: static storage, function prototype with (void), standard types (size_t, char), string literals (standard concatenation), standard library functions (malloc, memcpy, fprintf), casts, arithmetic and control flow (for, if), and a macro MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (a macro itself is not a language extension). There are no compiler-specific keywords or notations such as __attribute__, __asm/asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __declspec, #pragma with vendor-specific pragmas, extended integer types, or other documented compiler extensions. The odd-looking \"return ! 0;\" is valid standard C (evaluates to 0) and is not a compiler extension. Therefore there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
