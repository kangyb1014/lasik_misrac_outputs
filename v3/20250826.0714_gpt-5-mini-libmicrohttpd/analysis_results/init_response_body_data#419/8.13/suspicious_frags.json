  "explanation": "The listed fragments involve pointer usage and assignments where the const-qualification of pointed-to types should be checked: allocation and subsequent writes to body_dyn, copying from static string arrays into body_dyn, and direct assignment from a (const) filler string into body_dyn. These are the locations most relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for this rule: the static string definitions (static const char body_header[], body_filler[], body_footer[]) are already const-qualified; control-flow constructs (if/for) and scalar variables (pos, filler_pos) are not pointer declarations; calls like fprintf and the final return are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. Therefore they need not be examined for Rule 8.13 compliance."
