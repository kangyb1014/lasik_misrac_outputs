  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (loops/conditionals). The three listed if-statements are the only controlling expressions in this function and should be investigated for potential invariance. Other code fragments do not form controlling expressions (the (void) casts, assignments, response creation/destruction, returns, and variable declarations) and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no for/while/do-while loops or other conditional constructs in the function that could be invariant; hence no additional fragments need investigation."
