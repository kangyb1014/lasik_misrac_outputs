  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u201c(void) upload_data_size;\u201d is the common, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as used (and thus silence compiler warnings). It is an explicit no\u2011op use of the identifier rather than unreachable or truly redundant code introduced accidentally. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, but the cast\u2011to\u2011void is an explicit documented use: it (a) documents intent, (b) may be relevant if the parameter were volatile or had other observable effects, and (c) is the accepted pattern to suppress unused\u2011parameter warnings. In practice this line is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation. If you prefer to avoid the line, alternatives are to omit the parameter name in the function prototype, or use a single, documented way to mark unused parameters, but the agent A\u2019s claim that this specific line violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
