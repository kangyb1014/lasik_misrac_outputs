True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe expression statement \"(void) cls;\" is an executed no-op whose removal would not affect program behaviour. It simply discards the value of cls to silence a compiler warning, but cls is otherwise used in the function (and even if it were unused, the cast has no side-effects). This is executed code with no effect and therefore constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The statement \"(void) cls;\" is an evaluated expression statement that has no side\u2011effects and the parameter cls is used elsewhere in the function (it is read to initialize param). Removing that single statement does not change the observable behaviour of the function under the C abstract machine (it merely discards a value), so it meets the rule's definition of dead code: an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Therefore Agent A's claim is correct. (Minor caveat: MISRA Note 1 reminds that timing can be part of observable behaviour in embedded systems \u2014 in a contrived timing\u2011sensitive context removing any statement might be relevant \u2014 but for a plain read/discard of a non\u2011volatile parameter there are no side effects and the statement is redundant.)"
