  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The single cast-to-void statements such as (void) url; are an explicit, minimal use of a parameter to document intent and to suppress compiler \"unused parameter\" diagnostics. MISRA R2.2 targets truly dead operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Per the rule notes, behaviour can include timing, and such a statement is an explicit use that the project author intended; MISRA guidance and common interpretations treat these idioms as an acceptable way to mark unused parameters rather than as dead code. Therefore the claim that (void) url; constitutes a R2.2 violation is incorrect."
