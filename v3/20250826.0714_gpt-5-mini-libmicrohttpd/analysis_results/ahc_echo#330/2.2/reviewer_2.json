  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s characterization is not correct. The statements like \u201c(void) version;\u201d are idiomatic no\u2011op casts used to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although such an expression statement has no runtime effect (and removing it does not change the observable run\u2011time behaviour), MISRA\u2019s intent for Rule 2.2 is to forbid genuinely dead code that masks logical errors or unnecessary functionality \u2014 not the deliberate use of a void\u2011cast to document an unused parameter or avoid spurious warnings. In practice this pattern is the accepted way to show an unused parameter in callback APIs where removing the parameter name is not possible, and is treated as acceptable (or handled via a documented deviation) rather than a Rule 2.2 violation. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
