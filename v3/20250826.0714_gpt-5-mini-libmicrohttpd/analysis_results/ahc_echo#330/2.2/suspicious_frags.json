  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs are not suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they have observable effects or participate in control flow: - Declarations and initializations (static int aptr; struct handler_param *param = (struct handler_param *) cls;) are used (aptr's address is compared/assigned to *req_cls; param->response_page is read later). - The method checks (strcmp) and conditional returns affect control flow and behaviour (reject unexpected methods, early return for POST). - Assignments to *req_cls and the final reset (*req_cls = NULL) modify caller-visible state. - Calls to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response produce side effects (allocate/queue/destroy responses) and therefore are not dead. - Returns (MHD_NO, ret) are behaviourally significant. There is no unreachable code in the snippet; most operations are necessary for at least some execution paths, so they are not candidates for dead-code removal."
