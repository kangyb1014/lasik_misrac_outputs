  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-statements are present in the provided function ahc_echo. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the form of for loops (their three clauses and loop-counter usage). Since there are no for loops in this code, there are no code fragments within this unit that require investigation for Rule 14.2. The visible constructs are: variable declarations, if statements, comparisons (strcmp), pointer assignments/dereferences, calls to library/helper functions (strlen, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response), and casts; none are related to the requirements of Rule 14.2. Note that any for loops that might exist inside the referenced functions (e.g. implementations of MHD_* functions or library routines) are outside the scope of the supplied code and thus cannot be assessed here for Rule 14.2. Therefore no fragments from the provided code need investigation for this rule."
