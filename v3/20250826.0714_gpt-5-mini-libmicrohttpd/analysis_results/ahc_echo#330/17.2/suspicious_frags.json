  "explanation": "There are no explicit direct calls to ahc_echo in this function. The only plausible source of indirect (callback) re-entry is via the microhttpd API functions used here. Therefore the fragments selected are the places that interact with the MHD library (creation/queue/destroy response calls) and the request-cookie guard that attempts to detect/mark in-progress handling (*req_cls and aptr). Those sequences must be examined to determine whether any of the MHD_* calls can synchronously (directly or indirectly) invoke the request handler again, which would constitute indirect recursion.\n\nOther parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: simple variable declarations and casts (e.g. \"struct handler_param *param = (struct handler_param *) cls;\"), the unused-parameter (void) statements, the method string comparisons (strcmp checks and the early return MHD_NO), and the static declaration of aptr itself are not calls and cannot by themselves cause the function to call itself. Hence they are not relevant to Rule 17.2 and were not selected."
