  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n\n- The (void)expr idiom (e.g. (void) cls;) is a standard C technique to silence unused-parameter warnings, not a language extension.\n- The cast from void* to struct handler_param* ((struct handler_param *) cls) is standard C.\n- The local static variable declaration (static int aptr;) and taking its address (&aptr) are standard C behavior.\n- Pointer comparisons and assignments involving void* (e.g. *req_cls = &aptr; *req_cls = NULL;) are standard and portable in C (conversion to/from void* is allowed for object pointers).\n- Enum use (enum MHD_Result) and function-level static linkage (static enum MHD_Result ahc_echo(...)) are standard C.\n- The explicit casts to (const void *) when calling library functions are standard C casts.\n\nNo occurrences of common compiler-specific extensions are present (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, zero-length arrays, GCC nested functions, Microsoft-specific __declspec, or similar). Library/API identifiers (MHD_*) are calls to an external library; the library implementation might use extensions internally, but that is outside this translation unit and not visible in the supplied code. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
