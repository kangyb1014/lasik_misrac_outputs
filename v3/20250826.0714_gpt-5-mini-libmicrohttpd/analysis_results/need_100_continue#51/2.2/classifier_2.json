  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of need_100_continue:\n```c\nstatic bool\nneed_100_continue (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  const char *expect;\n\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The declaration 'const char *expect;' is not dead code: it is used as an out-parameter (&expect) in MHD_lookup_connection_value_n and later referenced in MHD_str_equal_caseless_(expect, ...). Removing the declaration would change program behaviour (uses of expect would be ill-formed), so Rule 2.2 is not violated. (By contrast, an unused declaration would be a violation.)"
