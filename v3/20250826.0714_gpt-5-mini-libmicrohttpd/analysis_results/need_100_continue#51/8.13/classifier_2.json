  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: 'expect' is declared as 'const char *' and is used only for read-only comparison. The string literal is a read-only operand and is typically accepted by a function taking 'const char *'. (If, however, the prototype of MHD_str_equal_caseless_ were to take a non-const 'char *' parameter, that function's parameter would violate the intent of Rule 8.13 by not being const-qualified \u2014 but that would be a problem in the function declaration, not in this call site.)"
