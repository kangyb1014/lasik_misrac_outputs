  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp appears in the provided code. The other fragments are simple checks (version, remaining_upload_size) or calls that pass explicit lengths (MHD_lookup_connection_value_n with MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_), so they do not indicate comparing null-terminated strings via memcmp. The only place that performs a string comparison of a runtime string against a string literal is the call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_(expect, \"100-continue\"), which should be investigated because its implementation could use memcmp on null-terminated strings. All other lines do not perform string comparisons that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and therefore do not need investigation."
