  "explanation": "No syntactic unreachable code is present in the provided function. Each conditional return depends on runtime values (connection->rq.http_ver, connection->rq.remaining_upload_size, the result of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, and the result of MHD_str_equal_caseless_), so none of the branches can be determined as always taken or always bypassed from this fragment alone. There are no statements after an unconditional return, no dead labels, and no constant-controlled conditionals visible here that would make any lines unreachable. The static qualifier only limits linkage and does not create unreachable code. Therefore there are no specific code fragments in this function that require further investigation for Rule 2.1 based solely on the provided source. If broader project context (e.g., guaranteed constant values for the fields or macros that expand to constant boolean expressions) is available, it could change reachability; but with the information given, no unreachable code fragments are identifiable."
