  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's scenario is plausible and the report is correct as a potential MISRA 21.17 violation. In the snippet, need_100_continue passes NULL for the length to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, so there is no visible guarantee in this code that the returned expect pointer points at a NUL-terminated buffer. If MHD_str_equal_caseless_ is implemented with string.h routines that assume NUL-termination (e.g. strcmp/strlen/strncasecmp or memcmp without a bounded length), those functions could read past the bounds of the object referenced by expect \u2014 exactly the kind of out-of-bounds access Rule 21.17 forbids. To determine whether a real violation exists you must inspect the API/contracts/implementations: either MHD_lookup_connection_value_n must guarantee NUL-termination of the returned value when length is not requested, or MHD_str_equal_caseless_ must perform a bounded comparison using the known length (or otherwise avoid unbounded string.h calls). If neither guarantee holds, the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
