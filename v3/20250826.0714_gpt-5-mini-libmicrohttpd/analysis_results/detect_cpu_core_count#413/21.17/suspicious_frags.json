  "explanation": "No uses of <string.h> functions are present in this function. The code only calls I/O functions (fprintf, printf) with constant format strings and supplies either integer values or string literals (\"\" and \"s\") as arguments \u2014 these are not buffer-manipulating operations and cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. There is no memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn or other string handling in this fragment, no character buffers or pointer arithmetic, and no copies from external buffers. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Any string handling in called functions like mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count or mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count would need to be checked in their own implementations, but that is outside this function's code.)"
