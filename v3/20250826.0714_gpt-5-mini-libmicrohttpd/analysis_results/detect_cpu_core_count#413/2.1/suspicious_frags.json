  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code was found in the provided function. Every branch in the function can be reached depending on run-time results of the external calls (mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count and mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count) and on build-time configuration (the presence/absence and value of MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT). The outer if/else is taken when the system count is <=0 or >0 respectively. The proc_cpu_count branch is reachable when the process-level call returns >0. The #ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT block is conditionally compiled and therefore either present and potentially reachable, or absent (not part of the project); it does not represent unreachable code in the project as a whole. The final fallback (if (0 >= sys_cpu_count) sys_cpu_count = 1) is reachable when both system and proc detections fail and no positive MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT is available. Because reachability depends on external return values and compile-time configuration, there is no code fragment that is unconditionally unreachable in all configurations and executions of the project."
