  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp appears anywhere in the provided function. Rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The code only performs character-by-character checks (e.g. equality with '%'), index arithmetic, calls to toxdigitvalue, and writes into the decoded buffer; there are no calls to memcmp or other library comparisons that would compare C strings as null-terminated. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14 in this function."
