  "explanation": "Only function-call sites are the calls to toxdigitvalue (the two occurrences shown). MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect self-calls; therefore places to investigate are all calls that might call back into this function (directly or indirectly). In the provided function there are no other function calls, no function-pointer dereferences or callbacks, and no macros that expand to calls visible in this fragment. The remaining code consists of assignments, pointer indexing, increments, casts and return statements, none of which can by themselves introduce recursion. Hence no other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2."
