  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression is tool_params.tiny, which is a run-time flag and not an invariant constant. This does not breach Rule 14.3. (It would be a violation only if tool_params.tiny were a compile-time constant or otherwise provably invariant, e.g. a #define or a constant expression that is always true/false.)"
