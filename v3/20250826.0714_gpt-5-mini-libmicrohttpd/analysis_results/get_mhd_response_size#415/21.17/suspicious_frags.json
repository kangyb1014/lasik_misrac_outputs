  "explanation": "No code fragment needs investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It only returns pointers to compile-time string literals (const char *), which are null-terminated and reside in static storage; there is no pointer arithmetic, buffer indexing, or use of external buffers that could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to string handling. Therefore there are no places in this function that could violate Rule 21.17."
