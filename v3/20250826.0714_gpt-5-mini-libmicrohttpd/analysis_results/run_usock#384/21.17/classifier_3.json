  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17. The call uses snprintf (from <stdio.h>), whereas Rule 21.17 as given applies to functions from <string.h>. Note however that snprintf with a %s specifier will read the characters of msg until a NUL byte; if msg is not a valid, NUL-terminated string (or points outside its allocated bounds) this would cause out-of-bounds accesses \u2014 a different safety defect that must be prevented by ensuring msg is a valid NUL-terminated buffer before this call."
