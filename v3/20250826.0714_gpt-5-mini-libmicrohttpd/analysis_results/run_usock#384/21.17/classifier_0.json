  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls free(msg), which is not one of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The rule concerns use of functions like memcpy/strcpy/etc. that can access beyond object bounds; free() does not perform string handling. (Note: if ws_receive_frame had returned a pointer into the local stack buffer 'buf' rather than heap memory, calling free(msg) would be undefined behavior and violate other rules, but that is not a violation of Rule 21.17.)"
