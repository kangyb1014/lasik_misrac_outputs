True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer 'msg' is assigned from ws_receive_frame and only used for read-only operations (passed to snprintf as %s and used to build/send a text frame) and then freed; it is never modified through 'msg'. Therefore it should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const unsigned char *msg').\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Although 'msg' is only read (not written) in this function, it points to dynamically allocated memory that is freed with free(msg). Declaring it as 'const unsigned char *' would force an explicit cast when calling free (or require changing the allocation/freeing API), which would violate other MISRA rules about discarding qualifiers. In other words, it is not reasonably possible here to make the pointer const without breaking the ownership/freeing semantics or introducing casts. Therefore this code does not constitute a straightforward violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
