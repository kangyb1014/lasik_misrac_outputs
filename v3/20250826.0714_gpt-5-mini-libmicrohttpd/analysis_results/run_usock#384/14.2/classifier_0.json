  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct WsData *ws = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;\n  unsigned char buf[2048];\n  unsigned char *msg;\n  char *text;\n  ssize_t got;\n  int type;\n  int i;\n\n  make_blocking (ws->sock);\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (ws->sock, (void *) buf, sizeof (buf), 0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    msg = ws_receive_frame (buf, &got, &type);\n    if (NULL == msg)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME)\n    {\n      ssize_t sent;\n      int buf_size;\n      buf_size = snprintf (NULL, 0, \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg);\n      if (0 < buf_size)\n      {\n        text = malloc ((size_t) buf_size + 1);\n        if (NULL != text)\n        {\n          if (snprintf (text, (size_t) buf_size + 1,\n                        \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg) == buf_size)\n            sent = ws_send_frame (ws->sock, text, (size_t) buf_size);\n          else\n            sent = -1;\n          free (text);\n        }\n        else\n          sent = -1;\n      }\n      else\n        sent = -1;\n      free (msg);\n      if (-1 == sent)\n      {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME)\n      {\n        free (msg);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    if (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock)\n    {\n      CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = MHD_INVALID_SOCKET;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (ws);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    if (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock)\n    {\n      CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = MHD_INVALID_SOCKET;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The for loop uses a single loop counter 'i' which is set in the first clause (i = 0), the second clause is a pure test using only the loop counter and an unmodified constant (i < MAX_CLIENTS), and the third clause increments only the loop counter (i++). The loop body modifies CLIENT_SOCKS[i], but that object is not used in the second or third clauses. Therefore the loop is well-formed per MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
