  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were not selected for investigation because they are ordinary control-flow and resource-management operations that are clearly executed and affect program behaviour (or are standard error-handling):\n\n- make_blocking (ws->sock); and the recv(...) call implement the input loop and determine timing/behaviour; they are not obviously removable without changing program behaviour.\n- The outer while(1) loop and its breaks are the core loop structure and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- The calls to ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame, free(msg), free(ws), MHD_upgrade_action and the updates to CLIENT_SOCKS in the mutex-protected section are tangible side-effecting operations (I/O, memory management, API actions) and therefore not dead code on inspection.\n- The pthread_mutex_lock/unlock and abort() calls are error-handling and synchronization; they are not dead because their removal would change program concurrency/error responses.\n\nThe selected fragments were chosen because they contain branches or patterns that are likely redundant, unreachable, or otherwise suspicious with respect to dead-code concerns (e.g. branches that may never be taken, or control paths that omit expected cleanup). Other areas of the function perform visible side effects or are necessary control constructs, so they do not meet the likely definition of dead code and were not included."
