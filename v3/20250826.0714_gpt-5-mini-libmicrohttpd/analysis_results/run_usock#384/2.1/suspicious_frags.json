  "explanation": "I identified fragments that warrant investigation for potential unreachable-code issues: the snprintf / buf_size / malloc / snprintf result branches (some else-branches may never be reached in normal execution), the nested else/if handling non-text frames (control-flow for other opcodes should be checked), and the conditional abort() calls (abort does not return \u2014 their usage should be reviewed for producing unreachable follow-up code). Other parts of the function are not listed because they do not contain obvious unreachable-code constructs: the while(1) loop uses break conditions that are reachable based on recv/ws_receive_frame results; variables are initialized before use; there are no statements following an unconditional return within the function; and there are no obvious dead labels or statements that can never be reached given the control flow. Therefore those regions do not need investigation for Rule 2.1."
