Its removal would not change program behaviour (assuming 'uri' is not volatile and its evaluation has no side effects), so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s surface-level argument (that the statement \u201c(void) uri;\u201d has no side effects and could be removed without changing runtime behaviour) is technically correct in a narrow C semantics sense. However, under MISRA practice this idiom is an intentional, documented way to mark a parameter as unused and to silence compiler warnings. MISRA\u2019s intention for Rule 2.2 is to forbid redundant executable code that indicates a defect or that can safely be removed; the explicit (void)param annotation is a deliberate, acceptable idiom for unused parameters and is not treated as a defect under MISRA guidance. In short: while the cast-to-void has no runtime effect, it\u2019s an accepted, purposeful construct and does not represent the kind of \u201cdead code\u201d Rule 2.2 is intended to prohibit. Therefore the report is not correct."
