  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for potential direct or indirect self-calls. The function uri_logger_cb contains no call to itself, no invocation of function pointers, and calls only standard library functions (malloc, gettimeofday) that do not call back into user code. The function is declared static (internal linkage) and does not call any other user-defined functions that could form an indirect recursion. The unused parameter casts ((void) cls; (void) uri;) do not perform any calls. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion to investigate."
