  "explanation": "The code contains no use of memcmp or any string-comparison operations on null-terminated strings. It only performs malloc, an optional gettimeofday call, and marks parameters as unused ((void) cls; (void) uri;). There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any manual byte-wise comparisons of C strings, so no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
