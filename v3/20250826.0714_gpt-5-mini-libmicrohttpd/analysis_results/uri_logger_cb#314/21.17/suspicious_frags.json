  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string-handling functions from <string.h> that could access beyond object bounds (e.g., memcpy, strcpy, strlen, strcat, etc.). The provided function does not call any <string.h> functions or perform any string/byte-buffer copy, concatenation, comparison, or length computation. The only uses of the uri parameter are (void) uri; which merely suppresses an unused-parameter warning and does not access the pointed-to object. The code allocates sizeof(struct timeval) and, after a NULL check, passes that pointer to gettimeofday \u2014 gettimeofday writes a struct timeval into the allocated storage of matching size, so there is no buffer overflow risk related to string functions. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate in this function."
