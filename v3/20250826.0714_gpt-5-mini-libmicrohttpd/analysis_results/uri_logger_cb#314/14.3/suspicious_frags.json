  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the function is invariant. The only controlling statement is the if: \"if (NULL != tv) gettimeofday (tv, NULL);\" \u2014 its expression depends on the runtime result of malloc and therefore is not a compile-time invariant. There are no loop constructs (while, for, do-while) or constant-condition ifs in the function. The (void) cls; and (void) uri; lines are cast-to-void expressions to suppress unused-parameter warnings and are not controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. The malloc call and the return statement are not controlling expressions either. Consequently there are no code fragments here that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
