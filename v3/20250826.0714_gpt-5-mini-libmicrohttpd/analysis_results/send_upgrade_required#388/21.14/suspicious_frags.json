  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function there are no calls to memcmp, nor any use of memcmp-like direct memory comparisons on string data. The only string-related operation is strlen(UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE) to obtain the length of a null-terminated string for creating a response buffer; strlen is not memcmp and does not violate Rule 21.14. The other calls (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) are library/API calls and do not themselves constitute uses of memcmp in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
