Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other statements in the function are directly used in producing and returning the HTTP response and therefore do not appear to be dead code: the function signature and local declarations (struct MHD_Response *res; enum MHD_Result ret;) are required for variable storage and the return type; the response creation call (res = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static(...)) produces the response object that is subsequently manipulated and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the final \"return ret;\" returns the result of the queued response and is observed by callers. The strlen(UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE) and the (const void *) cast are part of the response creation invocation and are not independent operations whose removal would leave behaviour unchanged. The early-return and cleanup paths are the only places where execution flow can diverge; those were either selected above for further inspection (possible dead or redundant operations) or are necessary for correct resource handling and not dead. No other lines are executed but unused or redundant in a way that their removal would not affect program behaviour."
