  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp is present in this function. The code only performs NULL checks, a bitwise mask test (kind & pos->kind), increments counters, and calls the iterator callback with header/value pointers and their sizes. There are no comparisons of null-terminated strings via memcmp in the shown code. Passing header/value pointers and sizes to the iterator does not itself constitute a memcmp usage here \u2014 any memcmp usage would be in the iterator implementation (not part of this fragment) and must be checked separately. Therefore no fragments in this function require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
