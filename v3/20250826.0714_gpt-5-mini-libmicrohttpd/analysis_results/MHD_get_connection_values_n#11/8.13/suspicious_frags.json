  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that involve pointer types or pointer-valued parameters which may need const qualification (function parameters, the iterator context pointer, the iterator call that passes header/value pointers, and the local pointer used to traverse the header list). Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C Rule 8.13 because they are non-pointer entities or use integer/enum fields: - The local 'int ret' and the enum 'kind' are non-pointer scalar types. - The tests and increments (e.g. NULL checks, \"ret++\", and the bitmask check on pos->kind) operate on scalars, not pointer target types. - Size fields (pos->header_size, pos->value_size) are integer-sized data, not pointer targets. - Return statements and the comparison to MHD_NO are control-flow constructs, not pointer declarations or pointer target usages. Note: the typedefs/definitions of MHD_KeyValueIteratorN and struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header are not present here; those definitions must also be reviewed to confirm whether their pointer members/parameter types should be const-qualified. The fragments listed above cover all pointer-related usages in this function that could be affected by Rule 8.13."
