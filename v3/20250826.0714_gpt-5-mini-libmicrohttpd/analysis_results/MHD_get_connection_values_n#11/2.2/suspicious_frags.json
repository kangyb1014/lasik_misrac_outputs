  "explanation": "I do not mark the following fragments for investigation because they are not prima facie candidates for dead code in this function context: the function signature and linkage (_MHD_EXTERN int MHD_get_connection_values_n(...)), the local declarations (int ret; struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;), the initial null-check that returns -1 when connection is NULL (this alters observable behaviour), the loop headers/iteration over connection->rq.headers_received as such (they are required to traverse data), and the final \"return ret;\" (necessary to produce the function result). The listed fragments are the places where operations (the initialization of the counter, the counter increments and the call to the iterator with its early return) could be redundant or may not affect program behaviour depending on external conditions (e.g. semantics of iterator, invariants about iterator being NULL or non-NULL, or invariants about header kinds) and therefore warrant inspection for compliance with Rule 2.2."
