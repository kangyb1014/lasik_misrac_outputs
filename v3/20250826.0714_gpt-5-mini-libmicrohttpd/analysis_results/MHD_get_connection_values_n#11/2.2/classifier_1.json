Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_connection_values_n:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_connection_values_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             MHD_KeyValueIteratorN iterator,\n                             void *iterator_cls)\n{\n  int ret;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return -1;\n  ret = 0;\n\n  if (NULL == iterator)\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if (0 != (kind & pos->kind))\n        ret++;\n    }\n  else\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n      if (0 != (kind & pos->kind))\n      {\n        ret++;\n        if (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                                pos->kind,\n                                pos->header,\n                                pos->header_size,\n                                pos->value,\n                                pos->value_size))\n          return ret;\n      }\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  ret = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment 'ret = 0;' initializes the variable 'ret' which is subsequently used (incremented and returned). Removing this statement would leave 'ret' uninitialized, altering program behaviour (undefined behaviour and incorrect return values), so the operation is not dead code."
