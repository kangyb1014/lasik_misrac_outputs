  "explanation": "No use of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) occurs in this function. The function only iterates a linked list and calls the provided iterator callback with pointer/size pairs (pos->header, pos->header_size, pos->value, pos->value_size). There are therefore no direct string-handling calls here that could cause out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. The only area potentially relevant to rule compliance is how the header/value buffers and their accompanying sizes are produced/maintained elsewhere (and how the external iterator uses them), but that falls outside this function and so is not a suspicious fragment inside this code to be reported."
