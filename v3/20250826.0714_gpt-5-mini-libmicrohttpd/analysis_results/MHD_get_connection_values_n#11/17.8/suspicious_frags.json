  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. There are no assignments to any of the parameters (connection, kind, iterator, iterator_cls), no increments/decrements, and no reassignments of pointer parameters. The code only dereferences 'connection' to read connection->rq.headers_received (reading the object pointed to is allowed), uses 'kind' in an expression (bitwise AND does not modify the parameter), and calls the function-pointer 'iterator' with 'iterator_cls' (passing the pointer by value; the callee may modify the pointed-to object which is permitted by the rule). Thus there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no other parts of the function need investigation for this rule."
