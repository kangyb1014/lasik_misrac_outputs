  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter (struct MHD_Connection *c). Within the function 'c' is never assigned to, incremented, decremented, or otherwise modified; it is only passed as an argument to MHD_queue_response(), which does not modify the caller\u2019s copy of the pointer. All other modified objects (resp, page_content, page_content_len, ret) are local variables or static objects and not function parameters. The pointer target objects may be passed to helper functions (allowed by the rule), but the pointer parameter itself is not altered anywhere in the code, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
