  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found. Reasoning: all executable statements can be reached at runtime depending on the value of resp. The two static local objects are declarations/initializers (not unreachable executable code). The only early exit (if (NULL == resp) return MHD_NO;) is a legitimate conditional return; the remainder of the function is executed when resp is non-NULL. There are no dead branches, unreachable labels, unconditional returns preceding code blocks, infinite loops, or other constructs that would render any statement permanently unreachable. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
