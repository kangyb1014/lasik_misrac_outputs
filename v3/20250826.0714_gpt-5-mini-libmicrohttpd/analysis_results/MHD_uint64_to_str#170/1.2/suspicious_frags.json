  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. Reasons: \n- The use of uint64_t and size_t are standard integer types from the C standard (stdint.h and stddef.h) and not compiler extensions. \n- UINT64_C(...) is the standard C macro for forming an unsigned 64-bit constant; it is not a compiler-specific extension. \n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSC-specific constructs present (no __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __typeof__, inline assembly, statement expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-prefixed tokens). \n- The casts, pointer arithmetic, control structures and comments are all standard C constructs. \n- The mhd_assert identifier is a macro/function call but its definition is not shown; nothing in this snippet uses a language extension. \nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that meet MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions) to be reported."
