  "explanation": "I inspected the function body and found no calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). There are no indirect calls or function pointers invoking standard string routines, and no inclusion/usage of string.h functions in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate.\n\nNotes (not relevant to Rule 21.17 but informative):\n- The code does perform direct writes via the pointer 'chr' (derived from the parameter 'buf'). Those writes could overflow the caller-provided buffer if buf is NULL or buf_size does not reflect the actual buffer length; this is a general buffer-safety concern but is outside the scope of MISRA Rule 21.17, which specifically targets the use of <string.h> functions.\n- Other operations (division, modulus, mhd_assert calls, decrementing buf_size) do not involve <string.h> functions and therefore are not subject to Rule 21.17 checks."
