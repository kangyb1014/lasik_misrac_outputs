  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 addresses direct or indirect self-calls (recursion). The only places in this function that could perform indirect calls are the calls to mhd_assert \u2014 these are the only function-call sites present and therefore should be checked to ensure they do not call back into MHD_uint64_to_str (directly or via other functions). Other code constructs do not require investigation for Rule 17.2: arithmetic operators (/,% ,+= etc.), assignments, pointer dereferences (chr = buf; *chr = ...), control structures (while, if, return), and the UINT64_C(...) macro (which yields a constant) are not function calls and cannot cause recursion. There are no function-pointer invocations, no other function calls, and no direct call to MHD_uint64_to_str in the body, so no other fragments need investigation for this rule."
