  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and therefore no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- while ((0 == digit) && (1 < divisor))\n  - The controlling expression depends on 'digit' and 'divisor'. 'digit' is updated inside the loop (digit = (int) (val / divisor)), and 'divisor' is reduced (divisor /= 10). Thus the expression can change each iteration and is not invariant.\n\n- while (0 != buf_size)\n  - The controlling expression depends on 'buf_size', which is decremented inside the loop (buf_size--). Therefore it is not invariant. The loop also contains an early return when divisor == 1 to prevent further division by divisor and to terminate once all digits are printed.\n\n- There is no do-while loop or intentionally invariant controlling expression used to create an infinite loop (the allowed exception), and no other conditional/loop constructs in the function have constant controlling expressions.\n\n- The mhd_assert(...) calls are not control-flow constructs here and do not create invariant controlling expressions; even if the macro is defined away, it does not affect the loop conditions.\n\nGiven these points, there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to report for Rule 14.3 in this function."
