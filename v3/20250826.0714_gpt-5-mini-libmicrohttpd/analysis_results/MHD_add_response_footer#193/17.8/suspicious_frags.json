  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. In this function: (1) none of the parameters are assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise altered \u2014 the function simply forwards them to add_response_entry. (2) footer and content are declared const char * so they cannot be modified here. (3) response is a pointer parameter but is not reassigned; it is only passed to add_response_entry. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted \u2014 such modifications (if any) would occur inside add_response_entry, which is outside the provided code. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or require investigation under Rule 17.8."
