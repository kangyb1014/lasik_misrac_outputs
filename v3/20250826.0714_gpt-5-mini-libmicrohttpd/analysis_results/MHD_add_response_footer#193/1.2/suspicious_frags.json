  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C constructs only: an enum return type, a pointer to a struct parameter, const char * parameters, and a return statement calling an ordinary function. The identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro-like token but, as presented, it is not an explicit compiler extension (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, statement-expression ({...}), nested functions, or other compiler-specific keywords/syntax). Because the macro definition is not shown, it cannot be flagged here \u2014 if _MHD_EXTERN expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example, __declspec(dllexport) or __attribute__((visibility("
