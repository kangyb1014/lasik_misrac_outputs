  "explanation": "I selected the function definition, the call to add_response_entry, and the argument constant MHD_FOOTER_KIND as fragments to investigate because they are the executable operation(s) present in this snippet and removal or replacement could potentially not affect observable behaviour if the wrapper is unused or the constant is redundant. Other parts of the snippet do not need investigation for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the return type and parameter type declarations (enum MHD_Result, struct MHD_Response *, const char *) are non-executable type/signature information, and the linkage macro (_MHD_EXTERN) and identifier names are not operations whose removal would be an executed operation; they affect linkage/visibility or compile-time semantics rather than representing executed code. There is no unreachable code inside this function (the body contains a single return), and no initialization/assignment issues in this snippet. Determination of dead code for the selected fragments requires project-wide analysis (e.g., whether MHD_add_response_footer is ever called, or whether add_response_entry or MHD_FOOTER_KIND are used elsewhere)."
