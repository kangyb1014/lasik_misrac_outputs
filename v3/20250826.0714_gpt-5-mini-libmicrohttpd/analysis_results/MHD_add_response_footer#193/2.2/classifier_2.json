  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_footer:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *footer,\n                         const char *content)\n{\n  return add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *footer,\n                         const char *content)\n{\n  return add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The provided wrapper function itself is not dead code as written: if it is called, it forwards to add_response_entry and its removal would change the API/call sites, so Rule 2.2 is not violated. A concrete violation scenario would be if this function is executed (i.e. called) but the call has no effect on program behaviour \u2014 for example if add_response_entry is a no-op (no side-effects) and all callers ignore the return value; then the call chain (including MHD_add_response_footer) would be an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour, which would violate Rule 2.2."
