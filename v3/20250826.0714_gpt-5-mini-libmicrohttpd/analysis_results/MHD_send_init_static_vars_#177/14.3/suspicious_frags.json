  "explanation": "No C-language controlling expressions (if, switch, for, while, do-while) are present in this function body. The only conditionals are preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #if, #endif), which are evaluated at compile time and are not subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (which concerns runtime controlling expressions). There are only direct function calls and comments inside the conditional compilation blocks; none constitute an invariant controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation under Rule 14.3."
