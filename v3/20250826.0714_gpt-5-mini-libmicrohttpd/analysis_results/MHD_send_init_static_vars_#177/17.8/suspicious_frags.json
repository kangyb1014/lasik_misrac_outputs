  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: The function MHD_send_init_static_vars_ is declared with (void) \u2014 it has no parameters to modify. The body contains only preprocessor conditional blocks, comments, and calls to other functions with no arguments (freebsd_sendfile_init_(), iov_max_init_()). There are no assignments to parameters, no pointer parameters, and no operations that could modify a function parameter in this translation unit. Therefore nothing in this code fragment needs investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
