  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code. The code contains only standard C constructs: a function definition with an explicit (void) parameter, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #if defined / #endif), comments, and ordinary function calls. The feature-test/configuration macros (HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE, SF_FLAGS, HAVE_SYSCONF, _SC_IOV_MAX) are build- or platform-detection macros, not compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler, __extension__, zero-length arrays, or labels-as-values). Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
