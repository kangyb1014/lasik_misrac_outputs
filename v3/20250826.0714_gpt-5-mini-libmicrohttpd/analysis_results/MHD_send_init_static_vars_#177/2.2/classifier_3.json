Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_init_static_vars_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && defined(_SC_IOV_MAX)\n  iov_max_init_ ();\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE\n  /* FreeBSD 11 and later allow to specify read-ahead size\n   * and handles SF_NODISKIO differently.\n   * SF_FLAGS defined only on FreeBSD 11 and later. */\n#ifdef SF_FLAGS\n  freebsd_sendfile_init_ ();\n#endif /* SF_FLAGS */\n#endif /* HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment as written does not itself contain dead code: the call to freebsd_sendfile_init_() is only compiled when the appropriate feature macros are defined, and (if compiled) is expected to perform initialization with observable side effects. Therefore, Rule 2.2 is not violated in the shown fragment. \n\nSpecific violation scenario (hypothetical): if freebsd_sendfile_init_() is implemented as an empty function or performs only operations that have no observable effect (no I/O, no volatile access, no modification of state used elsewhere), then when SF_FLAGS and HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE are defined the call would be executed but removable without changing program behaviour \u2014 that would constitute dead code and thus violate Rule 2.2."
