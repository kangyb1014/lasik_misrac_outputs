Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal_caseless:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal_caseless (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                         const char *const str,\n                         const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not necessarily. The line mhd_assert(0 != param->value.len); is an assertion (diagnostic) not an ordinary state-changing operation. If mhd_assert is implemented to perform a runtime check (and possibly abort) then its presence can affect program behaviour in failure cases and therefore is not dead. However, it becomes dead code in the specific case where (a) the condition is provably always true and (b) the assertion expands to an operation with no side effects (for example a no-op or a check that never fails). In that situation the assertion is an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour and thus would violate Rule 2.2."
