The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal_caseless:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal_caseless (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                         const char *const str,\n                         const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The mhd_assert call is not dead code as long as mhd_assert performs a runtime check (e.g. aborts/logs on failure) because removing it can change program behaviour (it prevents a later NULL dereference). However, if mhd_assert is defined as a no\u2011op in all build configurations (e.g. #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0)), then the statement has no effect and its removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 in that configuration it would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
