  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter. Analysis of each parameter:\n- param (type: const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *): only dereferenced (param->...), not reassigned. No statements like \u2018param = \u2026\u2019 or modifications to the pointer itself. The pointed-to object is accessed but not assigned to.\n- str (type: const char *const): declared as a const pointer to const data; it is only passed to functions and used in memcmp, not reassigned.\n- str_len (type: size_t): used in comparisons and passed to functions, not assigned or modified.\nOther expressions (mhd_assert, memcmp, MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n) only evaluate or read these parameters; none reassign the parameter variables themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
