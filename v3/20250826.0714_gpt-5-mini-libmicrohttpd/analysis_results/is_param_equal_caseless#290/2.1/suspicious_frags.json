  "explanation": "All other parts of the function (the declaration line, parameter list, scope braces and basic syntactic structure) are simple and contain no obvious statically unreachable statements and therefore do not require further inspection for Rule 2.1. The fragments listed above should be investigated because their behavior (in particular any control-flow effects introduced by macros or their expansions) can affect reachability; nothing else in the function can introduce unreachable code independently of those fragments."
