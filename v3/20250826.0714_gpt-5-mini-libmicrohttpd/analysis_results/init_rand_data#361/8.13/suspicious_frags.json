  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: local scalar declarations (fd, len, off, cc, b) are non-pointer objects so the rule does not apply; calls that pass integer/handle values (open, close, close return handling, CryptReleaseContext, GetLastError cast to unsigned long) involve non-pointer types; the &cc argument to CryptAcquireContext is a pointer to an output handle that the API is expected to modify, so making it a pointer-to-const would be incorrect; the read()/CryptGenRandom() uses are expected to write into the buffer (so the buffer pointer must be non-const) \u2014 nevertheless the specific read and CryptGenRandom calls are included above because of potential mismatches/casts and to verify the declared type of rand_data; string-literal usages as arguments are literal arrays of char which are inherently immutable in the source and are appropriate to pass to functions expecting const char * (therefore other uses of literals need no further investigation beyond the fprintf lines already listed that also pass strerror())."
