  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The operations on parameters are: a comparison (0 > offset) and a cast when calling MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 ((uint64_t) offset). Comparisons and casts produce temporaries and do not assign to or alter the parameter objects. No assignments, increments/decrements, or writes to the parameter variables occur, nor are pointer parameters present whose pointer value might be changed. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
