  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function has no pointer parameters and returns a pointer to struct MHD_Response which is expected to be owned/modified by the caller (factory/constructor semantics). Rule 8.13 requires adding const to pointer targets only when the pointed-to object should be immutable to the caller; here that would be inappropriate. A specific violation scenario would be: if the function actually returned a pointer to an internal, shared, read\u2011only MHD_Response instance that callers must not modify, then the signature should be 'const struct MHD_Response *' and the current non-const return would violate Rule 8.13."
