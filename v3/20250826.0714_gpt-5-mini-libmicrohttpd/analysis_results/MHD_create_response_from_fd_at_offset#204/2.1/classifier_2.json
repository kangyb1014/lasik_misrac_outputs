  "scenario": "In the shown function the statement `return NULL;` is executed when `offset` is negative (the test `0 > offset` is true). On typical platforms `off_t` is a signed type (POSIX) so the branch is reachable and Rule 2.1 is not violated. (If, however, on a specific platform `off_t` were unsigned so `0 > offset` is always false, the `return NULL;` would be unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.)"
