  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided snippet. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition, standard integer types (uint64_t), a cast, a simple comparison, and standard NULL. The token _MHD_EXTERN is a macro identifier \u2014 its use alone is not proof of a compiler extension; its definition would need to be inspected to determine whether it expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example __attribute__ or __declspec). There are no explicit compiler-extension tokens in the snippet (no __attribute__, __asm, __declspec, typeof, __builtin_*, __extension__ or other vendor-specific keywords) and no use of double-underscore reserved compiler-provided identifiers. Therefore there are no fragments here that, by themselves, trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
