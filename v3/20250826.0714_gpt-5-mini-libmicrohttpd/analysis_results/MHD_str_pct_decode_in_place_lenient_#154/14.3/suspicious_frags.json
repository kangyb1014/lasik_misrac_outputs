  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. Specific controlling expressions and why they are not invariant:\n\n- while (0 != str[r]) \u2014 depends on the contents of str indexed by r which changes as r is incremented; not invariant.\n- if (NULL != broken_encoding) \u2014 depends on the function parameter broken_encoding; not invariant.\n- if ('%' == chr) \u2014 depends on chr, set from str[r++] immediately before; not invariant.\n- if (0 == d1) and if (0 == d2) \u2014 depend on d1 and d2 read from the input string via r++; not invariant.\n- if ((0 > h) || (0 > l)) \u2014 depends on the return values of toxdigitvalue(d1/d2); not invariant.\n\nOther constructs are preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) or simple returns/continues; there are no do-while loops or while(1) infinite loops (the while loop terminates when str[r] == 0), so the allowed exceptions to Rule 14.3 (infinite loops or the special do-while case) do not apply. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
