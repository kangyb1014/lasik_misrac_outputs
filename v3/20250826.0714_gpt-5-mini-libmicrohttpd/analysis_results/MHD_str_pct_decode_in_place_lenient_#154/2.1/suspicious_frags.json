  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be unreachable. Reasoning: The function contains two alternative bodies controlled by the preprocessor macro MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE; each body is reachable depending on build configuration so neither branch is intrinsically unreachable. In the non-small-code body, all control-flow paths are reachable for some input: the while loop processes characters until the terminator; when chr == '%' the code either returns (if the string ends after '%' or after the first hex digit), or continues the loop after copying three characters on invalid hex digits, or continues after writing the decoded byte for valid hex digits. The statement str[w++] = chr; after the '%' handling is reachable when chr != '%'. All return and continue statements terminate or iterate as intended; there are no statements that can never be executed. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
