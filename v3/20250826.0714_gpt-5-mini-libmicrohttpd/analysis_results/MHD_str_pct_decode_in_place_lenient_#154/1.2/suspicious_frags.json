  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (compiler-prefixed), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, or other recognized GCC/clang/MSVC extensions.\n- No use of compiler built-ins or intrinsic functions (e.g. __builtin_*, _Interlocked*, etc.).\n- Only standard types and headers appear to be implied/used (size_t, uint8_t, unsigned char, int, char, bool) which are part of standard C (C99 and later for bool/stdint). Their usage here does not rely on an extension.\n- Preprocessor conditional (#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) is standard preprocessor usage and not a language extension.\n- All casts and pointer/array operations use standard C syntax.\n- No inline assembly, extended inline asm constraints, or nonstandard pragmas are present.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can re-scan for other categories of potential MISRA violations (naming, implicit conversions, null pointer checks, bounds, etc.)."
