  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The following checks were performed and found no evidence of extensions that compiler vendors mark as non-standard: no use of __attribute__ or other __prefixed identifiers (GCC/Clang extensions), no typeof or __typeof__, no statement-expressions ({ ... }) GCC extension, no inline assembly (asm), no nested functions (GCC extension), no non-standard keywords, no compiler builtins (__builtin_*), no Microsoft-specific extensions (like __declspec), no C++ constructs, and no unusual designated-initializer extensions. The only possibly-unknown items are macros or functions called here (mhd_assert, MHD_connection_close_, MHD_pool_reset, MHD_destroy_response, etc.); their definitions are not present in this fragment, but their usage syntax in this code contains no compiler-extension constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
