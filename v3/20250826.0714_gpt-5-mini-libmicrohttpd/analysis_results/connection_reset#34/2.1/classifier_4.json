  "scenario": "If MHD_connection_close_ does not return to the caller (for example it frees the connection and its memory pool, or performs a longjmp/exit), then the subsequent assignments that reference 'c' become unreachable; this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. The function comment (\u201cwill destroy ... memory pool, and set connection state to 'CLOSED'\u201d) suggests it might invalidate the connection \u2014 if it causes non-return or deallocation of 'c', the following lines are unreachable. Fixes: ensure MHD_connection_close_ always returns, move the cleanup assignments before the call, or remove the unreachable code."
