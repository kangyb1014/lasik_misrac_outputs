  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The source contains no direct calls to memcmp, and there are no explicit uses of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The code only uses memset, pointer assignments, integer/size checks, and calls to project-specific functions (MHD_*). None of these are memcmp string comparisons.\n\nNote: Any memcmp usage inside the implementations of called functions (e.g. MHD_pool_reset, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_connection_close_) cannot be determined from this snippet; those would need to be reviewed in their own definitions. However, within the provided connection_reset function itself there is no memcmp or code that compares null-terminated strings using memcmp, so no fragments here require investigation for Rule 21.14."
