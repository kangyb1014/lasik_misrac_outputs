  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement (void) uri; is the conventional idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA\u2019s concern in Rule 2.2 is with truly redundant code that is executed yet removable without intent (i.e. code that serves no design or diagnostic purpose). The cast-to-void is an explicit, intentional use of an identifier to document intent and silence diagnostics; it is recognised as a legitimate idiom and not treated as unwanted/accidental dead code in MISRA practice. Therefore the agent A\u2019s claim that this particular line is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
