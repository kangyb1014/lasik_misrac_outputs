  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found. Reasoning: execution enters the function and executes statements in sequence \u2014 the malloc call and the (void) casts are executed (the casts are no-op expressions used to suppress warnings, not unreachable). The conditional if (NULL != tv) has both a taken and not-taken path depending on malloc result; the gettimeofday call is reachable when tv is non-NULL and skipped when tv is NULL, so neither branch is unreachable. The final return tv; is reachable on all control flows. There are no early returns, goto statements, infinite loops, or code that follows an unconditional return/abort that would render any lines unreachable. Therefore no code in this fragment requires investigation for Rule 2.1."
