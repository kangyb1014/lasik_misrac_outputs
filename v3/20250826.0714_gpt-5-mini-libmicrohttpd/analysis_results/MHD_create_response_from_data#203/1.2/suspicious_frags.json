  "explanation": "The only candidate for a compiler-specific language extension in this snippet is the identifier _MHD_EXTERN, which is a macro that commonly expands to compiler-specific storage-class or attribute tokens (for example __declspec(...) on MSVC or __attribute__(...) / visibility pragmas on GCC/Clang). That expansion \u2014 if it contains compiler-specific keywords \u2014 would be a language extension and should be investigated. All other constructs in the function are standard C: size_t, void *, int parameter types, enum usage, conditional statements, and the return of a function call. There are no inline assembly blocks, GCC/Clang attributes written directly in this code, nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, variable-length arrays, or other explicit compiler extensions visible here, so they do not require investigation from the Rule 1.2 perspective."
