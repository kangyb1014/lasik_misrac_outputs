  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the only places in this function that introduce or propagate pointer types that might need const qualification: the function return-type pointer and the data parameter (and its forwarding to another API). Other lines do not declare or pass pointer types that could be const-qualified: 'size' is a scalar (size_t), 'must_free' and 'must_copy' are ints, 'mode' is an enum, and the conditional assignments to mode are simple enum assignments \u2014 none are pointer declarations or pointer uses relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13. Therefore they do not need to be investigated for this rule."
