  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies any of the function parameters themselves. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to connection, kind, key, key_size, value, or value_size (no use of =, +=, -=, ++, --, or similar on these parameters).\n- Pointer parameters (connection, key, value) are only read or passed to strlen/called function; strlen reads through key/value but does not modify them. Passing connection to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ may allow modification of the object pointed to by connection (which is permitted), but the pointer variable connection itself is not altered in this function.\n- The conditional expressions use the parameters only for comparisons and conditional evaluation (key ? strlen(key) : 0), not for modification.\nTherefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
