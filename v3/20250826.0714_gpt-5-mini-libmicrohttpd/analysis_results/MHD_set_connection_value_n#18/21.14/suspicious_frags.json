  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function there are no calls to memcmp. The two fragments listed are the only places handling the key/value null-terminated strings (length checks via strlen and the call that forwards the strings and sizes). These should be investigated because they deal with string pointers and lengths and may lead to string comparisons elsewhere (for example in the callee). Other lines (the function signature, the simple enum comparison MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != kind, the return of MHD_NO, and braces/flow-control) do not perform string content comparisons and do not use memcmp, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.14 in this snippet."
