  "explanation": "I report only the function declaration beginning with the macro-like token _MHD_EXTERN because it may expand to compiler-specific storage-class or visibility attributes (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__(...)) which are explicit compiler extensions and must be checked in the macro definition. Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 1.2: the use of standard types (size_t, enum, struct pointer), standard library function strlen, the conditional operator (?:), comparisons, return statements, and the regular function call to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ are all standard C constructs and do not themselves indicate a language/compiler extension. Identifiers such as MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND and the function names, while using underscores, are ordinary identifiers and do not by themselves imply compiler extensions. No use of known extension syntax (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, inline assembly, VLA extensions, or compiler-specific keywords) is present in the shown fragment."
