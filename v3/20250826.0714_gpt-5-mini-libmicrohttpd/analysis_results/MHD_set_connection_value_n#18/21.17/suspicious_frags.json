  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions that may access memory beyond object bounds. The only calls to such functions in this routine are the strlen calls shown above; these must be investigated because calling strlen on key or value that are not null-terminated can read past the objects. Other parts of the function do not invoke any <string.h> routines and therefore cannot directly cause the kind of out-of-bounds string accesses the rule targets: the comparison against MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND is a simple enum check, the ternary expressions only select between calling strlen or using 0 (the strlen calls themselves are already listed), and the final call to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ simply forwards arguments (its internals are outside this fragment and should be analyzed separately if needed). No other lines in this function call string.h functions or perform pointer-based string operations that would warrant investigation under Rule 21.17."
