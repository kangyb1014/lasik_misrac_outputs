Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct MyData *md = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = md->urh;\n  char buf[128];\n  ssize_t got;\n\n  make_blocking (md->sock);\n  /* start by sending extra data MHD may have already read, if any */\n  if (0 != md->extra_in_size)\n  {\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              md->extra_in,\n              md->extra_in_size);\n    free (md->extra_in);\n  }\n  /* now echo in a loop */\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (md->sock,\n                buf,\n                sizeof (buf),\n                0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n      break;\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              buf,\n              (size_t) got);\n  }\n  free (md);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh,\n                      MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (md->sock,\n                buf,\n                sizeof (buf),\n                0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n      break;\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              buf,\n              (size_t) got);\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The loop body performs meaningful I/O: each recv result >0 leads to a send_all of exactly those bytes, and the break on recv <=0 exits the loop. There is no executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so no dead code is present in this fragment."
