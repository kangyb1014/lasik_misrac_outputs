Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct MyData *md = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = md->urh;\n  char buf[128];\n  ssize_t got;\n\n  make_blocking (md->sock);\n  /* start by sending extra data MHD may have already read, if any */\n  if (0 != md->extra_in_size)\n  {\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              md->extra_in,\n              md->extra_in_size);\n    free (md->extra_in);\n  }\n  /* now echo in a loop */\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (md->sock,\n                buf,\n                sizeof (buf),\n                0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n      break;\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              buf,\n              (size_t) got);\n  }\n  free (md);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh,\n                      MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfree (md);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call free(md) deallocates the dynamically-allocated memory pointed to by md. Removing that call would change program behaviour (it would introduce a memory leak and alter resource usage/timing), so the operation is not dead code. (If md were not dynamically allocated, that would be a separate correctness bug, but not a dead-code issue.)"
