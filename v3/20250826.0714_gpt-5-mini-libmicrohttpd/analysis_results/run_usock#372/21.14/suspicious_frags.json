  "explanation": "No instances of the Standard Library function memcmp appear in the provided code. The function only calls make_blocking, recv, send_all, free, and MHD_upgrade_action; there are no explicit string comparisons or uses of memcmp to compare buffers or null-terminated strings. The buffer 'buf' is handled as a raw byte buffer with lengths from recv (variable 'got') and is sent using that length, so there is no evidence of treating it as a null-terminated string or comparing it with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 to investigate in this snippet."
