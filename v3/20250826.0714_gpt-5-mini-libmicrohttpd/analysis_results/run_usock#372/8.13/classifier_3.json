  "scenario": "The free call itself does not necessarily violate Rule 8.13. If md->extra_in is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *extra_in) there is no Rule 8.13 violation. A violation would occur if extra_in were declared with const qualification (for example: const char *extra_in); calling free(md->extra_in) would then discard the const qualifier (and require a cast), which would violate the intent of Rule 8.13."
