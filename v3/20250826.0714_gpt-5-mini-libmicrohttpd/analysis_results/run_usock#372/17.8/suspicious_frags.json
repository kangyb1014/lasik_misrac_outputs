  "explanation": "No fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is cls (void *). The code never assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variable cls (no statements like cls = ..., pointer arithmetic on cls, or passing &cls for modification). The only operations are: casting cls to struct MyData * (struct MyData *md = cls), dereferencing md to access and modify the pointed-to object (md->... and free(md)), and calling functions that act on the object referred to. Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report."
