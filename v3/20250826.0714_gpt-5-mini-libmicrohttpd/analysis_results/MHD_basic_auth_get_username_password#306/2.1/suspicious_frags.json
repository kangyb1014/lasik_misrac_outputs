  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are statically unreachable (i.e., no statements that cannot be executed in any possible run). Every branch and statement in the function can be reached under some combination of runtime conditions or build-time configuration: \n\n- The early return when info == NULL is reachable when MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3 returns NULL.  \n- The whole if (NULL != info->password) block is reachable when info->password is non-NULL. Within that block:  \n  - The username allocation success path (memcpy, asserts) is reachable when malloc succeeds.  \n  - The inner branch if (NULL != password) is reachable when the caller provides a non-NULL char**; the else that returns username is reachable when the caller passes NULL for the password parameter.  \n  - The *password allocation success or failure paths are reachable depending on malloc success/failure; on success the function returns username, on failure it falls through to free(username) and eventually returns NULL.  \n  - The logging statements guarded by #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES are reachable when that macro is defined at compile time (and are simply omitted when it is not).  \n- If info->password is NULL, the function falls through to free(info), sets *password to NULL if the caller provided a pointer, and returns NULL \u2014 this path is reachable when info->password is NULL.  \n\nNone of the return statements create code that is never reachable in any translation of the program: they terminate particular control-flow paths but alternate paths reach the remaining code. The asserts may abort in some builds but that is a runtime behavior, not a case of statically unreachable code. Therefore there are no fragments to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this function."
