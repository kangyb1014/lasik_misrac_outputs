True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo declares password as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *password) then this code only reads from info->password (copies via memcpy) and never modifies the pointed-to characters. In that situation the pointer could and should be declared const char *password, so the current usage violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, info->password is already declared as const char * then there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's reasoning is correct in principle. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In the shown function the code only reads from info->password (copies via memcpy) and does not modify the characters pointed to. If the struct field is declared as char *password (non-const) but is never modified anywhere that requires a non-const type, then that field should be declared const char *password and the current non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13. \n\nThat said, whether there is an actual MISRA violation in the project depends on the declaration of struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo and on whether other code legitimately needs to modify the pointed-to data. If info->password (or info->username) is already declared const char * there is no violation. If it is declared non-const for backwards-compatibility or because callers sometimes modify the buffer, then changing it to const may not be possible and the code would not be considered non-compliant in that broader context. \n\nIn summary: the report is correct conditionally \u2014 if the struct field is non-const and could be made const, this use violates Rule 8.13; otherwise there is no violation."
