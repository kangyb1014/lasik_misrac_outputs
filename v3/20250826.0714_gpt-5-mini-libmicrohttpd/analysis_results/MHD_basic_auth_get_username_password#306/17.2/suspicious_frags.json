  "explanation": "Fragments omitted from investigation: standard library calls and simple operations (malloc, free, memcpy, pointer assignments, return statements) are not included because they do not call user-defined functions and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion. The calls selected are those that invoke project-defined or potentially user-overridable functionality: the call to MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3 may (directly or indirectly) call back into MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password; MHD_DLOG invokes logging infrastructure that could call user handlers; mhd_assert is a macro that may invoke user-defined assertion handlers. These selected fragments should be investigated for possible indirect recursion. All other code fragments are plain memory operations or control-flow statements that cannot cause recursion and thus do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
