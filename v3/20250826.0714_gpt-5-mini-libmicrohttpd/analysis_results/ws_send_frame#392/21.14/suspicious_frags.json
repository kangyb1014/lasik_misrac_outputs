  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp appear in the provided function. I inspected the code for any direct calls to memcmp or aliases/macros that could expand to memcmp \u2014 none are present. The function performs only byte-wise copies from msg into a malloc'd buffer using an explicit length, sets a terminating '\\0', and iterates over CLIENT_SOCKS comparing socket handles (not strings). There are also no calls to strcmp/strncmp or other string-comparison functions in this fragment. Therefore there are no code locations in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: if memcmp (or an equivalent string comparison) exists in other translation units (for example inside send_all or other helper functions not shown), those places would need to be reviewed separately \u2014 they are outside the provided code fragment."
