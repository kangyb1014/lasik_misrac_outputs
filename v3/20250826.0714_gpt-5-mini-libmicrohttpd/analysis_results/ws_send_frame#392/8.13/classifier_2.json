  "scenario": "The buffer 'response' is allocated and written to (populated from 'frame' and 'msg') before being sent. Because the memory is modified, 'response' must be a non-const unsigned char * while being constructed. Passing that pointer to send_all does not itself violate Rule 8.13. A violation would occur if (a) send_all's prototype accepts a non-const pointer even though it does not modify the buffer (it should accept a const-qualified pointer), or (b) 'response' is never modified but is declared as non-const when it could be const."
