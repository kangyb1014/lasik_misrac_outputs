  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter msg is already const-qualified (const char *), so it meets the rule; frame is a local unsigned char array that is written to (so the pointed-to type cannot be const); local scalar variables (idx_first_rdata, idx_response, output, isock, i, length) are not pointer-to-object types and are irrelevant for this rule; copying from msg into the response buffer necessarily requires a writable buffer while it is being constructed. The only places where const-qualification of the pointed-to type might be applicable or questionable are the declaration/allocation of the response buffer and its use when passed to send_all (the prototype of send_all is not shown), so those fragments are reported for investigation."
