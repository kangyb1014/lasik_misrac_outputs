  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided ws_send_frame implementation. Therefore there are no direct string.h usages to inspect for out-of-bounds accesses as required by Rule 21.17. The manual byte copies in this function use explicit index arithmetic with an allocation of response sized to idx_first_rdata + length + 1, the first loop copies idx_first_rdata bytes from frame, the second loop copies length bytes from msg, and a terminating '\\0' is written at index idx_first_rdata + length \u2014 these indices match the allocated size and do not use any string.h routines. (Note: unrelated concerns such as potential size_t overflow in the allocation expression or correctness of send_all are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and thus are not flagged here.)"
