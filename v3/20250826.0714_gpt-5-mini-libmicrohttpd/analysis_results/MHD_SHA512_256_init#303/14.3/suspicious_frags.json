  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the provided function. Rule 14.3 concerns loop and conditional controlling expressions that are invariant (for example, for/while/do/if/switch controlling expressions that evaluate to a constant). The code in MHD_SHA512_256_init only performs constant assignments to members of the ctx structure (using UINT64_C macros) and initializes counters to zero; there are no for/while/do/if/switch statements or other controlling expressions to inspect. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 that require investigation."
