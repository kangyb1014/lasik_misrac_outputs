  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The code only performs direct assignments to ctx->H[0]..ctx->H[7] and sets numeric fields ctx->count and ctx->count_bits_hi to 0. There are no pointer parameters passed to standard string-handling routines, no use of character buffers, and no memory-manipulation calls that could access beyond object bounds as covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for compliance with Rule 21.17."
