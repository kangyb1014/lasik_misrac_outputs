  "explanation": "I did not identify any code fragments that are definitively unreachable for all possible builds/inputs. Reasoning by region:\n\n- Top-level branch (if (0 != strcmp(url, \"/\"))): all statements inside are reachable when the request URL is not \"/\"; this branch has multiple return points that are reachable depending on the runtime conditions (invalid method, file not found, internal error, or successful file response).\n\n- The MHD_HAVE_LIBMAGIC preprocessor region: the construct\n  #ifdef MHD_HAVE_LIBMAGIC\n    if (0 < got)\n      mime = magic_buffer(...);\n    else\n  #endif\n    mime = NULL;\n    { /* extension-based mime detection */ ... }\n  is a deliberate preprocessor/if-else pattern. When MHD_HAVE_LIBMAGIC is defined, the else applies only to the preceding if and sets mime = NULL on read failure; when it is not defined, mime = NULL executes unconditionally. The following brace-delimited block is a separate compound statement that always executes to attempt extension-based MIME detection. Nothing in this pattern is statically unreachable across all builds.\n\n- POST handling (if method == POST): the code returns at several points (on allocation, while receiving chunks, or after finishing). Each return is reachable for particular sequences of calls (initial POST setup returns MHD_YES to continue processing, subsequent calls with upload_data_size > 0 return MHD_YES, finalization returns a queued response). There is no code that cannot be reached in any run: different calls to the same handler represent different states rather than unreachable code.\n\n- GET/HEAD handling and final default branch: both are reachable for appropriate methods, and the final forbidden response is reachable for unexpected methods.\n\n- There are no statements after an unconditional return that are syntactically part of the same block (i.e., no literal dead statements following an always-executed return). All return statements lie on alternate control paths.\n\nBecause of the above, I did not mark any fragment as unreachable. If you want, I can re-evaluate with different assumptions (for example: if certain macros are guaranteed defined/undefined at build time, or if particular connectors guarantee a single call pattern) to see if any code becomes unreachable under those stricter assumptions."
