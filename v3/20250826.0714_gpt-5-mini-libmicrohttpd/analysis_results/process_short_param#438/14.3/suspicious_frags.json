  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Each if / else-if tests the local variable param_chr (initialized from param[0]), so the outcome depends on the runtime argument and is not a constant/compile-time invariant. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (and the permitted exceptions do not apply). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
