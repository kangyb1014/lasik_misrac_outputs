  "explanation": "I have listed every conditional branch that dispatches to a specific parameter handler. Each of these branches may correspond to behavior that is never exercised elsewhere in the project (i.e. could be dead code) and therefore should be investigated. The remaining fragments in the function are not flagged because they are not plausible candidates for dead code in isolation: the function signature and braces are required structure, the local read const char param_chr = param[0]; is used by the conditionals, and the final fprintf(...) and return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR; constitute the default error path when no branch matches (so they are reachable and not dead). Given only this single function, it is not possible to prove any branch is dead, so I reported all per-option branches for review."
