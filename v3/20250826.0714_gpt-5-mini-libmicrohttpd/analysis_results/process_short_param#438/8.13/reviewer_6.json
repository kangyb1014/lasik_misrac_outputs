True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nViolation occurs if process_param__thread_per_conn is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. char *param). Passing the string literal \"-P\" to a function parameter that is not const-qualified removes the const-qualification of the pointed-to object and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. To comply, the function parameter should be declared as const char * (or otherwise accept a pointer to a const-qualified type).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in the sense described: the code as shown will violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 if any of the called functions (e.g. process_param__thread_per_conn) are declared to take a non-const pointer (char *param) even though they do not need to modify the pointed-to characters. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so functions that merely read string data should be declared to take const char * parameters. \n\nA few clarifications: (1) In C the type of a string literal is an array of char (not const char), so at the language level passing \"-P\" to a function declared as char * is allowed (it decays to char *), but MISRA's intent is to avoid unqualified pointers when the pointee need not be modifiable. (2) If the callee actually needs to modify the string, then a non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no Rule 8.13 violation. (3) If the callee does not modify the string, the correct fix is to change its parameter to const char * to satisfy Rule 8.13 and to avoid accidental modification.\n\nSo the reported violation is valid conditional on the callee declarations being non-const; without knowing those declarations we cannot say the snippet by itself is definitively non-compliant, but the agent's scenario is accurate."
