  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer in the provided code, so no direct recursion is present. The only code locations that could lead to indirect recursion are the three return statements that invoke other functions; those calls must be inspected to determine whether those other functions (or functions they call) call back to MHD_create_response_from_buffer. Other fragments \u2014 the function signature, the enum equality checks (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE / MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY), the if/return control flow, and the use of &free as a callback pointer \u2014 do not by themselves create direct or indirect self-calls and therefore need not be further investigated for Rule 17.2 based on this snippet alone."
