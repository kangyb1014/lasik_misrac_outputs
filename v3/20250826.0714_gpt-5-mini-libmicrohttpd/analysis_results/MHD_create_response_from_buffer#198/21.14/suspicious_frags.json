  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body and found no uses of memcmp (or other C standard library string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) and no operations that compare or manipulate null\u2011terminated strings. The code only dispatches to other response-creation routines and passes a free callback; it does not perform any string comparisons itself. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usages exist, they would need to be in the target helper functions invoked here (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls or MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy) or elsewhere in the codebase \u2014 those were not included in this fragment and thus are outside the scope of this analysis."
