  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided fragment. In particular:\n- There are no compiler-specific tokens such as __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__, asm, typeof, __builtin_..., __inline, or other compiler intrinsics visible in the code.\n- The leading identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name in the source, but its expansion is not shown here; the source text itself does not contain any explicit extension keyword. The presence of a macro name alone is not proof of a language extension without its definition, so it is not flagged.\n- Usage of &free is standard C (taking the address of the free function) and not a compiler extension.\n- enum, NULL, and the function declaration/return constructs used are standard C constructs.\n\nBecause the code snippet contains only standard-language constructs and no explicit compiler-extension syntax, there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
