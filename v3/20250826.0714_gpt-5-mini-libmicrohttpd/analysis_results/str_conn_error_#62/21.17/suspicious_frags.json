  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and performs no buffer copies or pointer arithmetic that could cause accesses beyond object bounds. All returned values are string literals passed through the _() macro; returning pointers to string literals does not involve any of the prohibited string-handling operations. The switch and mhd_assert usage do not perform any string operations either. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
