  "explanation": "The only constructs that can produce indirect recursion are function or macro invocations that may ultimately call str_conn_error_ again. All return lines that invoke the identifier '_' and the call to mhd_assert are therefore flagged for investigation to determine whether these calls can (directly or indirectly) call str_conn_error_. Other fragments (switch statement, case labels, the if condition, numeric constants, and the function signature/return type) are non-invoking syntactic elements and cannot by themselves cause recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
