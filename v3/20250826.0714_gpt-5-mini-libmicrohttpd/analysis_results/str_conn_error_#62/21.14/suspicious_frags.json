  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no use of the standard library function memcmp, either directly or via an obvious wrapper/macro. The code only returns string literals (wrapped by the localization macro _), uses a switch on an integer, and performs simple integer tests; there are no string comparisons or calls that could be memcmp in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If there are other files or macros (e.g. a macro named memcmp or a macro that expands to memcmp) in the project, those should be checked, but within this supplied code fragment no memcmp usage exists."
