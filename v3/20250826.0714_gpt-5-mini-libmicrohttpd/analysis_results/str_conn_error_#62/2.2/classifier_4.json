The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of str_conn_error_:\n```c\nstatic const char *\nstr_conn_error_ (ssize_t mhd_err_code)\n{\n  switch (mhd_err_code)\n  {\n  case MHD_ERR_AGAIN_:\n    return _ (\"The operation would block, retry later\");\n  case MHD_ERR_CONNRESET_:\n    return _ (\"The connection was forcibly closed by remote peer\");\n  case MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_:\n    return _ (\"The socket is not connected\");\n  case MHD_ERR_NOMEM_:\n    return _ (\"Not enough system resources to serve the request\");\n  case MHD_ERR_BADF_:\n    return _ (\"Bad FD value\");\n  case MHD_ERR_INVAL_:\n    return _ (\"Argument value is invalid\");\n  case MHD_ERR_OPNOTSUPP_:\n    return _ (\"Argument value is not supported\");\n  case MHD_ERR_PIPE_:\n    return _ (\"The socket is no longer available for sending\");\n  case MHD_ERR_TLS_:\n    return _ (\"TLS encryption or decryption error\");\n  default:\n    break;   /* Mute compiler warning */\n  }\n  if (0 <= mhd_err_code)\n    return _ (\"Not an error code\");\n\n  mhd_assert (0); /* Should never be reachable */\n  return _ (\"Wrong error code value\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0); /* Should never be reachable */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If the mhd_assert macro expands to a no-op in the project build (for example when assertions are disabled via NDEBUG or a similar configuration), the statement `mhd_assert (0);` is executed but has no effect; removing it would not change program behaviour \u2014 this constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert has an observable effect at runtime (e.g. it triggers a diagnostic, logs or aborts), then it is not dead code and does not violate Rule 2.2."
