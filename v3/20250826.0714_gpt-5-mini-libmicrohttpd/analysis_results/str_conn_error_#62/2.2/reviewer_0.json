Removing that 'break;' would not change program behaviour because control would still fall through to the code following the switch. Therefore the 'break;' is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour and constitutes dead code (Rule 2.2). It appears to be present merely to mute a compiler warning, but that does not justify keeping dead code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The break; statement in the default label is an executed statement (it runs when the default is taken) and its removal would not change program behaviour because control would fall out of the switch and continue with the same code following the switch. By the rule text, that makes it dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour). Note 2 (unreachable code) does not apply here because the default is reachable. Suppressing a compiler warning is not a justification in the rule text. Therefore this construct violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
