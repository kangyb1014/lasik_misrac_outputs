  "explanation": "Only the preprocessor-guarded mutex-init block is flagged for investigation because it contains conditional compilation and an early return path that may be compiled in or out depending on build configuration; such conditional code can create project-wide unreachable code scenarios (either removed entirely or introducing return paths that affect reachability). All other fragments are simple, directly reachable statements or standard error-handling returns: the initial parameter check and the allocation failure check both return immediately on error (they are reachable by control flow), the field initialisations and the final return are the normal, reachable success path, and there is no code following the final return that would be unreachable. Therefore those other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1."
