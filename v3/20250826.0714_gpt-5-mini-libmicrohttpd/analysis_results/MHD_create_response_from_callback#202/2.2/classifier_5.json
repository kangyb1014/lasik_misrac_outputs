  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_callback:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_callback (uint64_t size,\n                                   size_t block_size,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderCallback crc,\n                                   void *crc_cls,\n                                   MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size))\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL == (response = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_Response)\n                                       + block_size)))\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = -1;\n  response->data = (void *) &response[1];\n  response->data_buffer_size = block_size;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  if (!

  "scenario": "The assignment response->crfc = crfc initializes the response object's callback member so later code (e.g. response teardown or content-release routines) can call that callback. Removing this statement would change program behaviour because the stored callback would be absent or incorrect, so the operation is not dead code."
