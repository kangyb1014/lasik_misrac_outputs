If pos->header_size is larger than the actual size of the object referenced by pos->header (or pos->header is NULL while header_size>0), memcpy(buf + used_size, pos->header, pos->header_size) will read beyond the bounds of the source object.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function only checks that the destination buffer has sufficient space, but it does not validate the source pointers (pos->header, pos->value) nor that pos->header_size / pos->value_size actually describe the size of the objects pointed to. If either pointer is NULL while the corresponding size is > 0, or if the size exceeds the actual object size, the memcpy calls will read beyond the source objects and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code would be compliant only if there is an external, provable invariant (established elsewhere in the program) guaranteeing that pos->header and pos->value are non-NULL and that their associated size fields are correct; no such guarantee appears in the presented snippet. Recommended fixes: ensure the metadata for headers/values is trustworthy (record and check allocated sizes), or explicitly validate non-NULL pointers and bounds before calling memcpy (or otherwise ensure the source buffers are large enough)."
