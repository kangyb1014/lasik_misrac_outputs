If the struct member is declared as char *header (non-const), that violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when the pointed-to data is not modified. Here the header string is only read (copied), so it should be declared const char *header (and const char *value). Fix: change MHD_HTTP_Res_Header members to const-qualified pointer types (e.g. const char *header, const char *value).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's observation is plausible but not verifiable from the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer shall point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The code indeed only reads pos->header and pos->value (they are used as the source argument to memcpy, which takes a const void *), so if the struct member types are declared as non-const (e.g. char *header; char *value;) and those strings are never modified through those pointers anywhere in the program, then that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const char *header and const char *value (or otherwise make the pointer point to const-qualified data). However, the posted function does not show the declaration of struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header nor the other code paths that might modify header/value. If those members are intentionally non-const because the program sometimes modifies the pointed-to data (or assigns non-const pointers into them), then changing them to const would be incorrect. Therefore the report cannot be confirmed from the provided code alone. To resolve: inspect the definition of MHD_HTTP_Res_Header and all uses of header/value \u2014 if they are never used to modify the pointed data, then the report is correct and the members should be const-qualified; otherwise the report is incorrect for this codebase."
