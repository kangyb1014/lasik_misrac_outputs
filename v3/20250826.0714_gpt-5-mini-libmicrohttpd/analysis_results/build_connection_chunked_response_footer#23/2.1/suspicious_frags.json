  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for unreachable code patterns (e.g., statements after an unconditional return, branches whose conditions are constant false, or code paths that can never be taken due to prior checks). None of the code fragments are statically unreachable: all returns are conditional and reachable at runtime; the for-loop and its inner if depend on runtime list contents; the mhd_assert calls do not introduce unreachable statements (they may be no-ops in production but do not make following code unreachable); there is no code placed after an unconditional return or inside a branch that can never be entered given earlier constant conditions. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
