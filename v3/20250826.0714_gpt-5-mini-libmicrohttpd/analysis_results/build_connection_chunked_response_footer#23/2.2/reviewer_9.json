True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe assertion is redundant: buf_size is obtained from connection_maximize_write_buffer(c) as the available space at c->write_buffer_append_offset, and the code has explicit checks (if (new_used_size > buf_size) return MHD_NO; and if (used_size + 2 > buf_size) return MHD_NO;) ensuring used_size never exceeds buf_size. After c->write_buffer_append_offset += used_size the relation c->write_buffer_append_offset <= c->write_buffer_size is therefore guaranteed by the earlier checks. The mhd_assert call only performs a runtime check (or is a no-op in non-debug builds) and has no side-effects when the condition holds, so removing it would not affect program behaviour. Because the assertion is executed but its removal would not change program behaviour, it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A assumes the mhd_assert has no observable effect and that removing it would not change program behaviour; that assumption is not justified. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed code whose removal would not affect behaviour. An assertion macro like mhd_assert can (and typically does) have observable effects in some build configurations (diagnostics, logging, abort on failure) and may influence timing in an embedded system \u2014 both of which are relevant under the rule (see Note 1). Even if the predicate is provably true given prior checks, you cannot conclude across the project that the assertion has no effect: (a) it may be enabled in some builds and thus removal would change behaviour, (b) its expansion may have side-effects, or (c) its presence can affect timing. Therefore the assertion cannot be classified as dead code based on the provided reasoning and the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
