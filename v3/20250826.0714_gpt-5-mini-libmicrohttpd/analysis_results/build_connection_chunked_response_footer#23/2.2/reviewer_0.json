  "explanation": "The agent A's report is correct in the given scenario. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour (i.e. dead code). If mhd_assert is defined in production builds as a true no-op (for example expands to ((void)0) or nothing), then the statement mhd_assert(connection->rp.props.chunked); is an executed no-op: it performs no action and removing that statement would not change program behaviour. That meets the definition of dead code and therefore violates Rule 2.2. \n\nIf, conversely, mhd_assert expands to an expression that can change program behaviour (e.g. aborts, logs and alters flow, or otherwise has side effects), then the assertion is not dead code and the rule is not violated. To comply unambiguously, either ensure assertions produce observable behaviour in all builds or remove/conditionally compile them so the production project does not contain executed no-op assertions."
