  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of build_connection_chunked_response_footer:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nbuild_connection_chunked_response_footer (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  char *buf;           /**< the buffer to write footers to */\n  size_t buf_size;     /**< the size of the @a buf */\n  size_t used_size;    /**< the used size of the @a buf */\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  mhd_assert (connection->rp.props.chunked);\n  /* TODO: allow combining of the final footer with the last chunk,\n   * modify the next assert. */\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_CHUNKED_BODY_SENT == connection->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rp.response);\n\n  buf_size = connection_maximize_write_buffer (c);\n  /* '5' is the minimal size of chunked footer (\"0\\r\\n\\r\\n\") */\n  if (buf_size < 5)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->write_buffer);\n  buf = c->write_buffer + c->write_buffer_append_offset;\n  mhd_assert (NULL != buf);\n  used_size = 0;\n  buf[used_size++] = '0';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n\n  for (pos = c->rp.response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if (MHD_FOOTER_KIND == pos->kind)\n    {\n      size_t new_used_size; /* resulting size with this header */\n      /* '4' is colon, space, linefeeds */\n      new_used_size = used_size + pos->header_size + pos->value_size + 4;\n      if (new_used_size > buf_size)\n        return MHD_NO;\n      memcpy (buf + used_size, pos->header, pos->header_size);\n      used_size += pos->header_size;\n      buf[used_size++] = ':';\n      buf[used_size++] = ' ';\n      memcpy (buf + used_size, pos->value, pos->value_size);\n      used_size += pos->value_size;\n      buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n      buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n      mhd_assert (used_size == new_used_size);\n    }\n  }\n  if (used_size + 2 > buf_size)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\r';\n  buf[used_size++] = '\\n';\n\n  c->write_buffer_append_offset += used_size;\n  mhd_assert (c->write_buffer_append_offset <= c->write_buffer_size);\n\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstruct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The local alias \"struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;\" is used throughout the function (e.g. c->rp.response, connection_maximize_write_buffer(c), c->write_buffer, c->write_buffer_append_offset). According to MISRA note 3, initialization is not considered an assignment candidate for dead code, and the alias is actually referenced, so removing it would require editing all subsequent uses. If, instead, the variable had been declared and never referenced (i.e. initialized but not used), that would be a Rule 2.2 violation."
