  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying a function parameter itself; it allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In this function the parameter is the pointer 'response' and there is no assignment or modification of the pointer variable 'response' itself. The code only (a) takes the address of members of *response (e.g. &response->mutex) to pass to lock/unlock functions and (b) increments a member of the pointed-to object ((response->reference_count)++). Both operations modify the object referred to by the pointer, not the pointer parameter, so they conform to Rule 17.8. The conditional compilation directives only control inclusion of the mutex calls and do not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
