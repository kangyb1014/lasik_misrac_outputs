  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ call is conditionally included via the preprocessor (#if). Code excluded by the preprocessor is not \"unreachable\" \u2014 it is simply not part of the translation unit. When MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS is defined the lock call is compiled and reachable at runtime. A true Rule 2.1 violation would be code that can never be executed in any compiled configuration (for example code guarded by an always-false constant expression such as if (0) { ... }), which is not the case here."
