  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The file contains only standard C constructs: conditional compilation (#if defined(...) || defined(...)), a normal function definition, pointer dereference (response->reference_count), the post-increment operator (++), and calls to functions or macros (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_). None of these are compiler-specific extensions such as inline assembly, __attribute__ or other compiler keywords (e.g. typeof, statement expressions, __asm, __declspec, extended inline functions, nested functions, variable-length arrays as an extension, or other documented compiler-specific features). The conditional compilation symbols (MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS, MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) are ordinary preprocessor macros and not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
