  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (and any direct memory comparisons that would be used to compare null-terminated strings). No calls to memcmp are present in the code. The function only uses strrchr, strlen, and strcpy \u2014 none of which are memcmp \u2014 so there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). Therefore no code fragments need to be investigated for this specific rule. Note: other potential issues (e.g. use of strcpy/strlen bounds safety) are outside the scope of Rule 21.14 and were not flagged here."
