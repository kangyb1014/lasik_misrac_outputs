  "explanation": "I examined the entire function. There are no compiler-specific language extensions present: no asm statements, no __attribute__ or __extension__ tokens, no GCC/Clang/MSC-specific keywords (typeof, __declspec, __stdcall, __cdecl, __fastcall, __asm, __builtin_*, etc.), no GNU statement-expressions, no named address-space qualifiers, and no Microsoft-specific keywords beyond the platform macro _WIN32 (which is a standard predefined macro for conditional compilation, not a language extension). The code uses only standard C constructs and standard library calls (strrchr, strlen, strcpy), standard types (size_t, const char *), preprocessor conditionals, and ordinary control-flow. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
