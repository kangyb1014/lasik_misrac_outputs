  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the if-statement is conditional and the return is only executed at runtime when tool_params.epoll is true; the surrounding code is reachable when tool_params.epoll is false. A Rule 2.1 violation would only arise if tool_params.epoll were effectively a compile-time constant (e.g. #defined or optimized to a fixed value) so that one branch can never be taken, but nothing in the presented fragment makes that determination, so the fragment itself does not violate Rule 2.1."
