  "explanation": "I selected the fragments above because they are the points where control flow decisions and assignments occur and therefore are the likely locations for unreachable-code issues when viewed in the wider project context. Other parts of the function (signature, braces, simple line breaks) are syntactic and do not contain alternate branches or code placed after an unconditional control transfer that would make them unreachable. To determine if any of the selected fragments are actually unreachable requires project-level context (e.g. possible values and initialization of tool_params flags, and how process_param__poll is called), which is why those specific fragments were flagged for further investigation."
