  "scenario": "The fragment uses fprintf with \"%s\" (and later param_name[1]). Rule 21.17 targets functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), so this exact use of fprintf does not itself violate 21.17. However, a practical out\u2011of\u2011bounds scenario exists: if param_name does not point to a valid NUL\u2011terminated string (for example it is a 1\u2011byte array containing '-' with no terminating '\\0', or it is NULL), then fprintf(\"%s\", param_name) will read past the object bounds (and param_name[1] is also undefined). That would be undefined behavior, but it is not a direct violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 which specifically concerns <string.h> functions."
