  "explanation": "The MISRA rule 21.17 concerns accesses to string objects and potential out-of-bounds reads. The three fragments above directly read from the string pointed to by param_name (two via %s in fprintf which requires a non-NULL, NUL-terminated string, and one via indexing param_name[1] which requires at least two characters including the NUL). These must be investigated to ensure param_name is non-NULL and sufficiently long/terminated. Other lines in the function only test boolean flags (tool_params.epoll, tool_params.select), set tool_params.poll, or return enumerated constants; they do not perform string accesses or call string.h functions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
