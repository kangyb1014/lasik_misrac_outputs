  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'tool_params.select' is a (run\u2011time) flag member and thus not an invariant controlling expression. This would only violate Rule 14.3 if 'tool_params.select' were an invariant (for example if it were a macro like '#define select 1' or a compile\u2011time constant/const object that never changes), in which case the if would be using an invariant controlling expression and violate the rule."
