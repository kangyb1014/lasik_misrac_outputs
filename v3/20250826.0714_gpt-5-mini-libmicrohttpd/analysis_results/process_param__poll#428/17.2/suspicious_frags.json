  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect self-calls (recursion). The provided function process_param__poll contains no calls to itself and no other function calls that could plausibly be an indirect recursive path:\n- The only function invoked is fprintf (standard library), which cannot call back into process_param__poll in this context.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences or callback invocations in the fragment.\n- Accesses to tool_params fields are simple data reads/writes, not calls.\n- The return expressions use constants and parameter indexing only, not function calls.\nTherefore there are no suspicious fragments in this code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
