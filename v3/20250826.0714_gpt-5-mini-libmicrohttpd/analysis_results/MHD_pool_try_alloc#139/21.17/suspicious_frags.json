  "explanation": "No direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The remaining statements are bounds checks, arithmetic and assertions (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, comparisons against pool->end and pool->pos) that ensure asize fits within the pool before the allocation proceeds; these do not themselves invoke string.h functions. The only constructs worth investigating for compliance with Rule 21.17 are the statements that produce the pointer into the pool and the subsequent call-like macro that may mask a string.h call. All other fragments do not use string.h functions and are therefore not relevant to this rule."
