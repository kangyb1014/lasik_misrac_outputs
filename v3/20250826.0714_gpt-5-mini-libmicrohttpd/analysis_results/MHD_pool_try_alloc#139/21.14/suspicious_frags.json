  "explanation": "I inspected the entire MHD_pool_try_alloc function. There are no calls to memcmp (or to strcmp/strncmp/etc.), no operations that compare null-terminated strings, and no use of char* string buffers \u2014 only size_t arithmetic, pointer/index arithmetic into pool->memory, assertions, and macro calls (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, mhd_assert, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY). None of these are string-comparison operations or standard-library memcmp usage. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
