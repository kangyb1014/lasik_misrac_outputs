  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. ret is a void * returned to callers for allocation (mutable) and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY operates on writable memory; making the pointer const would prevent intended writes. A violation would occur if the pointed memory were only read (e.g. function only returned a read-only view) or if pool->memory had been declared const but assigned to a non-const pointer, in which case the pointer should be to a const-qualified type."
