Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_try_alloc:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_try_alloc (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                    size_t size,\n                    size_t *required_bytes)\n{\n  void *ret;\n  size_t asize;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n  if ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n  { /* size is too close to SIZE_MAX, very unlikely */\n    *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n  {\n    mhd_assert ((pool->end - pool->pos) == \\\n                ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->end - pool->pos));\n    if (asize <= pool->end)\n      *required_bytes = asize - (pool->end - pool->pos);\n    else\n      *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  *required_bytes = 0;\n  ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize];\n  pool->end -= asize;\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (ret, size);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n  {\n    mhd_assert ((pool->end - pool->pos) == \\\n                ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->end - pool->pos));\n    if (asize <= pool->end)\n      *required_bytes = asize - (pool->end - pool->pos);\n    else\n      *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Both assignment branches are potentially reachable depending on pool->pos and asize. For example, if pool->pos==0 then (pool->end - pool->pos)==pool->end and the else branch (*required_bytes = SIZE_MAX) can be taken; if pool->pos>0 there exist asize values with (pool->end - pool->pos) < asize <= pool->end that make the then branch executed. The assignments therefore affect program behaviour and are not dead code. The mhd_assert call may be compiled out in non-debug builds but that is an intentional diagnostic and does not make the surrounding code dead."
