The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_try_alloc:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_try_alloc (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                    size_t size,\n                    size_t *required_bytes)\n{\n  void *ret;\n  size_t asize;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (size);\n  if ( (0 == asize) && (0 != size) )\n  { /* size is too close to SIZE_MAX, very unlikely */\n    *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)\n  {\n    mhd_assert ((pool->end - pool->pos) == \\\n                ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->end - pool->pos));\n    if (asize <= pool->end)\n      *required_bytes = asize - (pool->end - pool->pos);\n    else\n      *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  *required_bytes = 0;\n  ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize];\n  pool->end -= asize;\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (ret, size);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The single line is a call to the assertion macro mhd_assert checking alignment: mhd_assert(pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos));. Whether this is dead code cannot be determined from the fragment alone. In the normal case where mhd_assert performs a runtime check (and on failure reports/aborts) this operation affects program behaviour and is not dead code. However, if in the project mhd_assert is defined so that the check is compiled into a statement that is executed but has no side effects (for example a macro that evaluates the boolean expression and discards the result, or a no-op in all builds), then that executed operation could be removed without changing program behaviour and would therefore constitute dead code (violation of Rule 2.2)."
