  "explanation": "I selected the two conditional branches that handle (a) the case where the computed aligned size became zero while the requested size was nonzero (overflow/wraparound), and (b) the branch for insufficient pool space (including its two subcases assigning required_bytes). These are the code paths most likely to be provably unreachable depending on the definitions/constraints of ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, the pool fields, and SIZE_MAX handling, so they warrant investigation.\n\nOther parts of the function do not need further investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the final allocation path (setting required_bytes = 0, computing ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize], adjusting pool->end, unpoisoning memory, and returning ret) is the normal reachable path when asize <= pool->end - pool->pos. The mhd_assert(...) statements are diagnostic checks (typically compiled out in non-debug builds) and do not introduce runtime unreachable code by themselves. No other branches or statements in the function appear to be unconditionally unreachable given the surrounding logic, so they were not included."
