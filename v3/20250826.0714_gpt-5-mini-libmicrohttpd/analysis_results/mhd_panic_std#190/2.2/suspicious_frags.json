Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code in the function should not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2: the fprintf call (inside #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) has observable side effects (output) and uses the parameters, so its removal would change program behaviour; the abort() call terminates the program and is clearly behaviourally relevant; the function signature, attribute (_MHD_NORETURN), preprocessor condition and comments are not executable operations that would be classified as dead code. There is no unreachable code in this fragment \u2014 only the explicit no-op (void) casts are executed without effect and hence warrant inspection."
