  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function exhibits direct or indirect self-calling. Specifically:\n- There is no call to mhd_panic_std anywhere in the function body (no direct recursion).\n- The function does not take or invoke any function pointer or callback that could call back into mhd_panic_std (no indirect recursion via stored/passed pointers in this snippet).\n- The only function calls present are fprintf (inside the HAVE_MESSAGES branch) and abort. fprintf is a standard library I/O function and does not call user functions from this scope; abort terminates the process and cannot cause recursion back into this function. The _() macro merely yields a string/literal (typically for localization) and does not imply a call to mhd_panic_std.\n- The (void) casts are no-op statements to suppress compiler warnings and cannot cause recursion.\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 in the supplied code."
