  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies any function parameter. The (void) casts for cls, file, line, and reason are no-ops used to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not assign to or alter the parameters. The fprintf call only reads file, line and reason (passes them by value or as pointers) and does not modify them. The parameters file and reason are declared as const char * (so the pointed-to characters are not modifiable through these pointers here), and line is an unsigned int passed by value. There are no assignments, increments, or other operations that change the parameter variables or reassign pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
