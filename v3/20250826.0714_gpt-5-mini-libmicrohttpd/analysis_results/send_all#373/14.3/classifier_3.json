  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression is 'off < len' and 'off' is modified by the loop increment (off += (size_t)ret), so the expression is not invariant. (Although ret may be zero in some iterations, that is a runtime behavior that can cause non\u2011progress, it does not make the controlling expression statically invariant and therefore does not breach Rule 14.3.)"
