  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided send_all function, so there are no string.h uses that could access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters as required to trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only buffer/length usage is send(&buf[off], len - off): the loop condition (off < len) ensures &buf[off] points inside the buffer and len - off is non\u2011negative while the call is made, and ret is assigned before the loop increment uses it. The Windows-specific cast (int)(len - off) is not a string.h invocation \u2014 it may raise other concerns (e.g., truncation if len - off > INT_MAX) but does not fall under Rule 21.17, so it should not be investigated for this Rule. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
