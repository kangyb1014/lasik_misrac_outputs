  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in this function. Specifically:\n- buf is never assigned to; using &buf[off] is pointer arithmetic to form an rvalue and does not change the pointer parameter itself.\n- len is only read and used in expressions/casts (e.g. (int)(len - off)); there is no assignment to len.\n- sock is passed to make_blocking and send but not reassigned in the function.\n- off and ret are local variables used for loop control and return values; off += (size_t) ret modifies the local off, not the parameter len or buf.\n- There are no statements that assign to buf, len, or sock. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
