  "explanation": "I inspected the entire send_all function. It contains no call to memcmp (nor any macro or wrapper that appears to be a memcmp-like comparison). The code only calls make_blocking and send, performs numeric comparisons on ssize_t/size_t return values and errno (EAGAIN), and does pointer arithmetic to pass a buffer slice to send. There are no string-comparison operations (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) and no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
