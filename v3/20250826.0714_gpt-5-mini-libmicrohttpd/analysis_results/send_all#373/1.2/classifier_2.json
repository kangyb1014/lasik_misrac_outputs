  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment uses the standard preprocessor 'defined' operator to test compiler/platform predefined macros (_WIN32, __CYGWIN__). This is ordinary, standard preprocessor usage and uses implementation-defined/predefined macros provided by compilers \u2014 not a language extension as described by compiler documentation. Therefore Rule 1.2 is not violated."
