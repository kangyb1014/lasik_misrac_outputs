  "explanation": "I looked specifically for use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any equivalent usage that compares null-terminated strings via memcmp). There are no calls to memcmp in the provided function. The other code fragments do not use memcmp or perform string comparisons via memcmp, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14:\n\n- The checks of tool_params.poll and tool_params.select are simple boolean tests, not string comparisons.\n- The fprintf calls only format and print messages; they do not compare strings or call memcmp.\n- The assignment tool_params.epoll = ! 0; is a boolean assignment, not a string comparison.\n- The final return expression ('-' == param_name[1] ? PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR : PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR) is a single-character comparison by indexing param_name; it does not call memcmp nor compare null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\nBecause no memcmp usage or equivalent false-positive patterns are present, there are no fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 21.14."
