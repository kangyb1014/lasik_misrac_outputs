  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The code fragment uses fprintf (a stdio function) with the \"%s\" format and does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, strlen, strcpy). Therefore it does not violate Rule 21.17. Note: there is a related safety concern\u2014if param_name does not point to a null-terminated string, using \"%s\" will cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads/undefined behavior (a different MISRA/runtime issue), but that is not a direct violation of Rule 21.17."
