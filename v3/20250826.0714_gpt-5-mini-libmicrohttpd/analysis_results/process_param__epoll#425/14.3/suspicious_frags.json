  "explanation": "The remaining lines (fprintf calls and the literal return values such as PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR) do not contain controlling expressions and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The function signature, braces and simple assignments/returns that are not used as controlling expressions are also not relevant to Rule 14.3 and need not be investigated for invariant controlling expressions."
