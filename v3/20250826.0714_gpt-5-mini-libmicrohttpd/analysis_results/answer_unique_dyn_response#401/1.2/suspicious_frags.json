  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the given code. Specifically:\n- No GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof/__typeof__, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or zero-length array extensions are present.\n- The preprocessor usage (#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 / #else / #endif) is standard C preprocessor usage, not a language extension. The hexadecimal literal and macro comparison are standard C.\n- Casting to (void *) and the explicit (void) var; unused-variable casts are standard C and commonly used to silence warnings, not extensions.\n- The static variable, enum type, pointer operations, strcmp calls, and function calls are all standard C constructs.\n- Identifiers beginning with MHD_ are library/API symbols (libmicrohttpd) and not compiler language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can also check for other MISRA rules or review the library/API usage for conformity to MISRA constraints (e.g., runtime behavior, use of library functions)."
