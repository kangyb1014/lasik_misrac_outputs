  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can produce code that is never executed without further inspection: the first-call branch that returns immediately (may make later code unreachable for that call), the method-check that returns early for unsupported methods, and the conditional compilation pair (only one branch will be compiled in any build, making the other branch unreachable in that build). Other parts of the function were not selected because they are standard, reachable elements in normal control flow: variable declarations and initializations (static int marker, r, ret), the (void) casts to mark unused parameters, the calls to MHD_queue_response / MHD_destroy_response and the final return are reachable whenever the function proceeds past the early returns and are not intrinsically unreachable. No other unconditional statements remain in the source that cannot be executed under any feasible compilation or runtime condition, so they do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
