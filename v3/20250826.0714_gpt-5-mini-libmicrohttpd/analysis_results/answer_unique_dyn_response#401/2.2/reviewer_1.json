  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statements like (void) cls; are the standard, intentional idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings; they have no side-effects but are used to document intent and control diagnostics. MISRA\u2019s concern in Rule 2.2 is truly pointless code that is executed yet has no effect on program behaviour. In practice MISRA accepts the explicit (void) parameter cast idiom for unused parameters (it is the prescribed way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter), so these lines are not treated as violations of Rule 2.2. In short: the cast-to-void expressions are intentional annotations to suppress warnings and are not considered dead code under the MISRA interpretation, so the reported violation is incorrect."
