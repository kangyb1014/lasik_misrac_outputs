  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in the absence of a documented, enforceable guarantee that the parameter 'method' is non-NULL and NUL-terminated. The code calls strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET) and strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD) without checking method for NULL or ensuring it points to a NUL-terminated array. If 'method' were NULL these calls would dereference a NULL pointer; if 'method' points to a non-terminated buffer strcmp could read past the object bounds \u2014 both are exactly the class of out-of-bounds accesses that MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids.\n\nIf the surrounding framework (libmicrohttpd) formally guarantees that the 'method' argument is always a valid, NUL-terminated string (and this guarantee is relied upon by the project), then the use of strcmp is acceptable. However, the presented function contains no such validation or documented assertion, so the report of a Rule 21.17 violation is correct for this code as shown. Recommended fixes: validate method != NULL before calling strcmp (and document or otherwise ensure NUL-termination), or rely on a recorded API contract and add a comment/annotation establishing that guarantee for static analysis and code review."
