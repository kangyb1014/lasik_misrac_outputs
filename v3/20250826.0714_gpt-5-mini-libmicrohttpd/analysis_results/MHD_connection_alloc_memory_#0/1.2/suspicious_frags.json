  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (no __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __atomic, etc.).\n- No compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or pragmas are present.\n- No inline assembler or vendor-specific function qualifiers are used.\n- All identifiers and constructs (const pointer declarations, size_t, function calls, standard C comments and Doxygen-style comments) are standard C, not documented compiler extensions.\n- The literal true is a standard boolean macro from <stdbool.h> (C99 and later) rather than a compiler extension; mhd_assert is a macro call but not shown to use any compiler extension within this fragment.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If you want me to re-evaluate with additional files (e.g., the definitions of MHD_pool_* or mhd_assert macros or included headers), provide them and I will check those for compiler-specific extensions."
