  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 not violated in this fragment. The local variable is declared as 'struct MemoryPool *const pool' (a const pointer to a non-const MemoryPool) and it is passed to MHD_pool_allocate. An allocator function normally modifies the pool internal state (allocations), so the pointee cannot reasonably be const; likewise the returned void * must be a mutable pointer. If, however, MHD_pool_allocate actually does not modify the MemoryPool, then the function signature should take a 'const struct MemoryPool *' (and/or the local pool variable should point to const), in which case this use would violate Rule 8.13."
