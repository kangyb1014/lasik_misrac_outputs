  "explanation": "I inspected the entire response_completed_callback function. There are no calls to memcmp, nor any obvious wrappers that perform string comparisons using memcmp. The code only calls MHD_destroy_post_processor, close, fprintf, unlink, free and standard pointer checks; the filename is passed to fprintf and unlink but is not compared using memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
