  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement calls the standard library function free(uc->filename). This does not call response_completed_callback (neither directly nor indirectly) in standard C, so no recursion occurs. Therefore Rule 17.2 is not violated. (Only a contrived/nonstandard implementation of free that invoked this callback would create an indirect self-call.)"
