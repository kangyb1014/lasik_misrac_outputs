  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided function. I checked for common explicit extensions that compiler docs typically list (and that MISRA Rule 1.2 prohibits), including: GCC/Clang/TCC/MSC extensions such as __attribute__ annotations, __builtin_* functions, typeof, statement-expressions ({ \u2026 }), nested functions, inline assembly (asm), or use of compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __extension__, __inline__ vs inline), and none are present. The (void) casts, static function specifier, enum parameter, use of POSIX functions (close, unlink) and standard library calls (fprintf, free, NULL) are standard C or library usage, not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
