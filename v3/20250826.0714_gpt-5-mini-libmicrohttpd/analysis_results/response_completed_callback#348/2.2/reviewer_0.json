Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of response_completed_callback.\n```c\nstatic void\nresponse_completed_callback (void *cls,\n                             struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             void **req_cls,\n                             enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct UploadContext *uc = *req_cls;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements (void) cls; (void) connection; and (void) toe; are expression-statements that have no side effects; their removal would not change program behaviour, so they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. These statements are executed but are no-ops, so they meet the rule\u2019s definition of dead code. \n\nRemediations include removing those no-op casts and either (a) omitting the names of the unused parameters in the function definition (e.g. use unnamed parameters or comments in the parameter list), or (b) using a single, documented mechanism to indicate unused parameters that is acceptable to your project (for example a compiler-specific unused-attribute or a standardized macro that expands appropriately for the toolchain). Any chosen fix should avoid leaving executed no-op statements in the code base."
