  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. A cast-to-void of a parameter (e.g. \u201c(void) cls;\u201d) is a common, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings; it serves as documentation and a portability/diagnostic control mechanism. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executable code whose removal would not alter the program\u2019s observable runtime behaviour (including timing), i.e. true dead code. Removing the (void) expressions would not change runtime semantics, but it would only affect compile-time diagnostics and the intent annotation \u2014 not the program\u2019s behaviour as understood by Rule 2.2. Thus the reported \u201cviolation\u201d is spurious. (If one prefers, the unused parameter can alternatively be handled by omitting the parameter name in the function prototype/definition or by using a standard UNUSED macro/attribute, but that is a style/diagnostic matter, not a Rule 2.2 violation.)"
