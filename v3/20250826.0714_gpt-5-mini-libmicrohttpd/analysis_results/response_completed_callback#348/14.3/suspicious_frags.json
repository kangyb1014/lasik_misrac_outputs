  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are compile-time invariant. The function contains only if statements whose controlling expressions depend on runtime values: (NULL == uc) depends on *req_cls, (NULL != uc->pp) depends on uc->pp, ( -1 != uc->fd) depends on uc->fd, and (NULL != uc->filename) depends on uc->filename. None of these are integer constant expressions or otherwise manifestly constant at compile time, so they do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. There are no loops with invariant controlling expressions (no while/for/do-while constructs), and the permitted exceptions (infinite loops or the do-while constant-false case) are not applicable. Therefore there are no code fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
