  "scenario": "Not violated in this context: the parameter type is the callback signature imposed by the external library (libmicrohttpd) so the implementation cannot change it to 'const struct MHD_Connection *'. If this were an internal function under your control and the function does not modify the pointed-to object, then keeping 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' (non-const) would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 \u2014 it should be 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection'."
