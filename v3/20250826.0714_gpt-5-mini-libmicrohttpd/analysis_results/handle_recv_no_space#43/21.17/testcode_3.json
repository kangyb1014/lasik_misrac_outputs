  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call passes c->read_buffer and c->read_buffer_offset to handle_req_headers_no_space without showing how the callee uses the buffer. If the callee uses string.h functions that expect a NUL-terminated C string (for example strlen(), strcpy(), strcat()) or uses an incorrect length, an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access can occur. Concrete violation scenario: handle_req_headers_no_space calls strlen(c->read_buffer) or strcpy(dest, c->read_buffer) while the buffer is not NUL\u2011terminated within the first c->read_buffer_offset bytes (or contains binary data), so strlen scans past the valid region and reads beyond the buffer bounds. Therefore the fragment can lead to a Rule 21.17 violation unless the callee guarantees bounded/string-safe usage (e.g. uses functions with explicit lengths and never reads past c->read_buffer_offset or ensures a terminating '\\0' within bounds).\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified handle_recv_no_space code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/439.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of handle_recv_no_space as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_recv_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_recv_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                      enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage stage)\n{\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT <= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS >= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_FULL_REQ_RECEIVED > c->state);\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_INIT == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_METHOD != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_URI != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HTTPVER != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_HEADERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE != stage); /* handle_req_cookie_no_space() must be called directly */\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_CHUNKED != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_FOOTERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (!
