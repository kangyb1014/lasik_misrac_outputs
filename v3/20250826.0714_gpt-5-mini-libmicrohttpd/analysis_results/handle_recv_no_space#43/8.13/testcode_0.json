  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIf connection_close_error is declared to take a mutable char * (for example: void connection_close_error(struct MHD_Connection *c, char *msg)) or if the _() macro yields a non-const char *, this call passes a string literal (type const char[N] \u2192 const char *) to a non-const pointer parameter, which discards const qualification and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The fix is to declare the parameter as const char * (e.g. void connection_close_error(struct MHD_Connection *c, const char *msg)) and ensure _() returns const char *.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified handle_recv_no_space code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/433.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of handle_recv_no_space as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_recv_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_recv_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                      enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage stage)\n{\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT <= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS >= stage);\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_FULL_REQ_RECEIVED > c->state);\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_INIT != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_INIT == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_METHOD != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_URI != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HTTPVER != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_HEADERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert (MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE != stage); /* handle_req_cookie_no_space() must be called directly */\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_CHUNKED != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_FOOTERS != stage) || \\\n              (MHD_CONNECTION_FOOTERS_RECEIVING == c->state));\n  mhd_assert ((MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL != stage) || \\\n              (!
