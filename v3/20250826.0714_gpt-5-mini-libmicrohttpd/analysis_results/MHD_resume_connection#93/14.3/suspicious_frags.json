  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: - Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) are compile-time inclusion directives, not C controlling statements covered by the rule. - The mutex lock/unlock calls and assignments (connection->resuming = true; daemon->resuming = true;) are simple statements, not controlling expressions. - The mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool); call is a macro invocation here; there is no explicit selection/iteration statement in the source shown besides the two if statements already listed. - No loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements are present in this function that would create controlling expressions to check. - The flagged fragments cover the only selection statements in the function; any potential invariance arising from compile-time macro settings or from the semantics of the helper macros/functions should be investigated via those fragments."
