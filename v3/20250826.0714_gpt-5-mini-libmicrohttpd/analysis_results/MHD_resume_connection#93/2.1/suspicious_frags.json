  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could mask unreachable code depending on macro definitions or on whether certain functions/macros are non-returning:\n\n- The MHD_PANIC call: if MHD_PANIC is implemented as a non-returning abort/exit (e.g. marked noreturn), code paths after the call (for the case where the condition is true) may render subsequent statements effectively unreachable; its semantics must be checked.\n\n- The mhd_assert macro: in many projects assertions are compiled out in release builds (becoming empty), which can change control flow or reveal unreachable code patterns depending on its definition; verify whether the assertion is active or removed and whether that affects reachability.\n\n- The mutex lock/unlock blocks wrapped in POSIX/W32 thread macros: these blocks are conditional on compilation symbols. If the symbols are never defined in the project configuration, those statements are omitted; conversely if they are always defined, they are reachable. Their presence/absence can create differing control-flow graphs across builds and should be reviewed.\n\n- The inter-thread-communication conditional and its logging: the inner logging call is further conditional on HAVE_MESSAGES; if HAVE_MESSAGES is always undefined in the project, the entire error-reporting branch becomes an empty block, which is suspicious to review. Also the predicate involving MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ and MHD_itc_activate_ may be constant (always true/false) depending on macro/function definitions; this could make the whole block unreachable.\n\nWhy other lines were not included: simple assignment statements (connection->resuming = true; daemon->resuming = true;) and the overall function structure do not by themselves indicate unreachable code \u2014 they are executed whenever the function proceeds past the MHD_PANIC check. Standard function start/return and ordinary statements are therefore not suspicious for MISRA Rule 2.1 in this snippet. Any other lines not listed are either ordinary reachable statements or are already covered by the listed conditional/macro-guarded fragments that can affect reachability."
