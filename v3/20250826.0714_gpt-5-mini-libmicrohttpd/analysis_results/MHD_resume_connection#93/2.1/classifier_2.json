  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The conditional block is controlled by a preprocessor macro (MHD_USE_THREADS) and is either compiled in or excluded; code that is not compiled is not \"unreachable\" in the sense of MISRA Rule 2.1. The mhd_assert call (when compiled) can be executed at runtime, so the fragment does not contain unreachable code. (A violation would occur only if the statement were present in the translation unit but could never be executed due to unconditional control flow\u2014for example, code placed after an unconditional return/goto that always executes.)"
