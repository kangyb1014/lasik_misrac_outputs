  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ call is guarded by the same #if expression as the earlier lock, so when compiled for threaded builds it is reachable (matched with the lock). When the macro is not defined the whole pair is excluded by the preprocessor, so no unreachable code is introduced. (It would be a violation only if there were an unconditional jump/return preventing execution in the same compiled path, which is not the case here.)"
