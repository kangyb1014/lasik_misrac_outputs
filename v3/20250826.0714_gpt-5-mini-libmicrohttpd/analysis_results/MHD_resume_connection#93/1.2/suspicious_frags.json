  "explanation": "I found no explicit compiler language extensions in the provided fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs and portable preprocessor conditionals: - Conditional compilation (#if defined(...)) is standard. - The backslash used to continue long string literals is the standard source-line splicing mechanism (not an extension). - Use of true/false is the standard C99 boolean macros if <stdbool.h> is used; nothing in the snippet shows a compiler-specific boolean. - The identifiers and macros (e.g. _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_PANIC, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_) are ordinary macros; although they could expand to compiler-specific attributes (for example __attribute__ or __declspec) that would be extensions, no such tokens (e.g., __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, ({ ... }), nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions) appear directly in this source fragment. - No inline assembly, statement-expressions, typeof, zero-length arrays, or other known language extensions are present. Because the rule requires reporting only explicit uses of compiler language extensions as stated in compiler documentation, and none are present in this code snippet, there are no suspicious fragments to report."
