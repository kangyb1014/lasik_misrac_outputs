  "explanation": "No pointer targets in the provided code fragment violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: \u2022 The function parameters param_name, param_tail and next_param are declared as const char *, so pointer targets are already const-qualified. \u2022 The only non-const pointer usage is &param_value passed to get_param_value; that is an output parameter and therefore must be a non-const unsigned int * (const would prevent writing the result), so it is appropriate not to be const. \u2022 The use of param_name in fprintf is passing a const char * to a function that accepts const char * for format arguments, so no violation. \u2022 The stderr FILE* is non-const by design and not subject to this rule. \u2022 The assignment tool_params.connections = param_value involves no pointer target in this fragment; the type of connections is not shown, but the fragment itself does not contain any non-const pointer that should be const-qualified. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation for Rule 8.13."
