  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: static storage class, enum return type, standard integer types (unsigned int), const char * parameters, standard library I/O (fprintf), and ordinary control flow. There are no occurrences of compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, computed gotos (labels as values), GCC/Clang built-ins (__builtin_*), variadic macro extensions, or other documented compiler extensions. The identifier name contains a double underscore, but that is a naming/reserved-identifier concern rather than a compiler language extension and therefore outside the scope of Rule 1.2 as specified."
