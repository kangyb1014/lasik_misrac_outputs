  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 targets use of string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that might access beyond object bounds. The provided function does not call any of these Standard Library string handling functions. The only pointer passed is to setsockopt with either &on_val or &off_val and size sizeof(on_val) \u2014 both objects are of the same type and live for the duration of the call, so there is no risk of out-of-bounds access from a string.h call. The TCP_NODELAY conditional simply selects between calling setsockopt or returning 0; no string operations or buffer manipulations occur. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
