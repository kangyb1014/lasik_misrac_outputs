  "explanation": "No code fragment in the supplied function shows direct or indirect self-calls. The only function call present is setsockopt, which is an external library/system call and not MHD_socket_set_nodelay_; there are no function-pointer invocations, callbacks, or other calls that could hide an indirect call to MHD_socket_set_nodelay_. The preprocessor conditional controls inclusion of setsockopt usage only; it does not introduce any recursion. The remaining statements are local constant declarations, a ternary selecting a pointer, a cast, sizeof, a (void) cast to suppress unused-parameter warning, and return statements \u2014 none of which can cause the function to call itself. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 17.2."
