  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Reasoning:\n- There are no assignments to the parameters 'sock' or 'on' (no statements like sock = ..., on = ..., ++sock, etc.).\n- The parameter 'on' is only used as the condition in the conditional expression ((on) ? &on_val : &off_val); it is not altered.\n- The parameter 'sock' is either passed to setsockopt or explicitly cast to void ((void) sock) to suppress unused-parameter warnings; neither use modifies the parameter variable.\n- Taking the address of local const variables (&on_val, &off_val) and casting to (const void *) does not modify any parameter.\n- Even if MHD_socket were a pointer typedef, the code does not perform pointer assignment or arithmetic on that parameter; passing it to setsockopt uses its value but does not assign to the parameter itself. \nTherefore there are no fragments that require investigation for potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
