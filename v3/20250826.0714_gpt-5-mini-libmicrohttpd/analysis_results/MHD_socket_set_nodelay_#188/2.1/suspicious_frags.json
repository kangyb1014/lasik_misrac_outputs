  "explanation": "The only parts of this function that can be unreachable are the two mutually exclusive conditional-compilation branches governed by TCP_NODELAY: depending on build configuration one branch will never be compiled/executed. These branches therefore must be inspected to determine whether either is effectively unreachable across the project. No other code in the function is suspect for Rule 2.1: the function signature and parameters are used, there are no statements following the returns, the ternary expression references local variables that are used, and there are no other dead-code constructs present in this snippet."
