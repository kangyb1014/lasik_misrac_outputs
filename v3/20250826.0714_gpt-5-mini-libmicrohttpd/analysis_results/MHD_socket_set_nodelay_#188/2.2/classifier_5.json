  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_socket_set_nodelay_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_socket_set_nodelay_ (MHD_socket sock,\n                         bool on)\n{\n#ifdef TCP_NODELAY\n  {\n    const MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ off_val = 0;\n    const MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ on_val = 1;\n    /* Disable Nagle's algorithm for normal buffering */\n    return setsockopt (sock,\n                       IPPROTO_TCP,\n                       TCP_NODELAY,\n                       (const void *) ((on) ? &on_val : &off_val),\n                       sizeof (on_val));\n  }\n#else\n  (void) sock;\n  return 0;\n#endif /* TCP_NODELAY */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn setsockopt (sock,\n                       IPPROTO_TCP,\n                       TCP_NODELAY,\n                       (const void *) ((on) ? &on_val : &off_val),\n                       sizeof (on_val));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The ternary expression selects between &on_val and &off_val based on the runtime parameter 'on', and the setsockopt call is executed to change socket options. Removing either operand or the call would change program behaviour, so no executed operation here is redundant (not dead code)."
