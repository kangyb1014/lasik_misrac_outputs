  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning: \n- There are no pointer variable declarations in this function that could be more const-qualified. The function parameters are MHD_socket and bool (neither is a pointer). \n- The only pointers involved are the addresses of the local objects on_val and off_val, which are declared const (const MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_), so their addresses are pointers to const-qualified types. \n- The setsockopt call accepts a const-qualified pointer (the code casts the address expression to (const void *)), so the const qualification is preserved rather than removed. The conditional operator selects between two operands of the same const pointer type. \n- There is no casting that removes const qualification or any pointer being passed where it could reasonably be made const but is not. \nTherefore no fragments require further investigation under Rule 8.13."
