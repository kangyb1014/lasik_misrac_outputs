  "scenario": "The fragment itself only stores the pointer and size (pos->header = key; pos->header_size = key_size;) and does not call any <string.h> functions, so this line alone does not violate Rule 21.17. A concrete violation scenario would be: later code calls a string function such as strlen(pos->header) or strcpy(dest, pos->header) when key is not NUL-terminated or when the call requests or assumes more bytes than key_size (or when key points to a buffer that has been freed), causing accesses beyond the bounds of the object referenced by pos->header."
