  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the controlling expression (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail) is not an invariant. Its truth depends on the runtime state of the connection structure (pointer value may change), so it is not an integer constant or compile-time constant. The rule 14.3 exceptions are not needed here."
