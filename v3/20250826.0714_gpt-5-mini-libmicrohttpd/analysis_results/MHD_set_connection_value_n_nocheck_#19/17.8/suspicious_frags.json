  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The code only: - uses the pointer parameter 'connection' to modify the object it points to (connection->rq.* members), which is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified); - copies the values of non\u2011pointer parameters (kind, key_size, value_size) and pointer parameters (key, value) into fields of the newly allocated 'pos' structure, which does not modify the parameter variables themselves; - does not reassign any parameter variable (no statements like 'connection =', 'key =', 'value =', 'kind =', or 'key_size =', etc.). The call to MHD_connection_alloc_memory_(connection, ...) passes the pointer by value and cannot change the caller's pointer variable. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
