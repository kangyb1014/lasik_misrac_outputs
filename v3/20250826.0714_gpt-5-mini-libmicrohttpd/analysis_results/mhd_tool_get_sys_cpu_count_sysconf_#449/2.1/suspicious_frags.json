  "explanation": "Fragments not listed have been considered and are not flagged as unreachable for the purposes of Rule 2.1: the function signature and the initialization/return of 'ret' (static int mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_(void), int ret = -1;, and return ret;) are normal entry/exit points and are reachable in at least some preprocessor configurations; the preprocessor conditionals themselves (#if / #endif) control compilation rather than producing dead code in the translation unit \u2014 which must instead be checked by configuration-time analysis; the assignment ret = (int) value; is reachable whenever the preceding checks allow flow to that point. The suspicious fragments above were selected because they introduce conditional execution paths (compile-time and runtime) that can lead to code that may never be executed depending on macro configuration or prior runtime results (e.g. sequential sysconf calls guarded by the same condition, the early return on value <= 0, and the overflow return), and thus should be investigated to determine if any code is genuinely unreachable under the intended project configurations."
