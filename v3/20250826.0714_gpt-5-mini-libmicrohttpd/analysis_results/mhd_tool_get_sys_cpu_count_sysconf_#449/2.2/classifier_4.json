Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && \\\n  (defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) || defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN))\n  long value = -1;\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN */\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROC_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN */\n  if (0 >= value)\n    return -1;\n  ret = (int) value;\n  if ((long) ret != value)\n    return -1; /* Overflow */\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF &&\n          (HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN || HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN) */\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ((long) ret != value)\n    return -1; /* Overflow */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The check ((long)ret != value) detects loss of information from casting long to int (overflow). For example, if sysconf() returns value = 4294967295 (or any long outside the range of int), ret = (int)value will be truncated; the comparison will be true and the function will return -1. Removing this check would allow truncated/incorrect CPU counts to be returned, changing program behaviour. Therefore this code is not dead."
