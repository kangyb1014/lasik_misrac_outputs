Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && \\\n  (defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) || defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN))\n  long value = -1;\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN */\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROC_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN */\n  if (0 >= value)\n    return -1;\n  ret = (int) value;\n  if ((long) ret != value)\n    return -1; /* Overflow */\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF &&\n          (HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN || HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN) */\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 >= value)\n    return -1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "When HAVE_SYSCONF and at least one of HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN or HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN is defined and a call to sysconf() fails (returns -1) or returns 0, the test if (0 >= value) return -1; is executed. For example, if sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) returns -1, the condition is true and the function returns -1. Removing that return would change program behaviour (the function would continue and potentially produce a different result), so this code is not dead."
