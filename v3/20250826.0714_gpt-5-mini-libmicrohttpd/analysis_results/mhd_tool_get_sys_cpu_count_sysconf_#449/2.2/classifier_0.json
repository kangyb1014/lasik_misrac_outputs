  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#if defined(HAVE_SYSCONF) && \\\n  (defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) || defined(HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN))\n  long value = -1;\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN */\n#ifdef HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  if (0 >= value)\n    value = sysconf (_SC_NPROC_ONLN);\n#endif /* HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN */\n  if (0 >= value)\n    return -1;\n  ret = (int) value;\n  if ((long) ret != value)\n    return -1; /* Overflow */\n#endif /* HAVE_SYSCONF &&\n          (HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN || HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN) */\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint ret = -1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The line int ret = -1; is an initialization (not considered dead per MISRA Note 3) and it affects behaviour in builds where the conditional HAVE_SYSCONF block is omitted (the function returns -1). Even in builds where the conditional code overwrites ret before use, the initializer is not considered dead code across the project; therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
