  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were reviewed and are not reported as suspicious for dead code for the following reasons:\n\n- The initial checks (MHD_D_IS_USING_POLL_ / MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_) perform early returns and clearly affect control flow; removing them would change program behaviour.\n\n- The NULL checks for read_fd_set and write_fd_set (returning MHD_NO) are input-validation exits; these returns directly affect behaviour and are therefore not dead.\n\n- The HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE branch that checks for fd_setsize == 0 and the subsequent logic that constrain or validate fd_setsize produce values that are used later (they affect the value passed to internal_run_from_select). Assignments and returns in that path are not candidates for removal.\n\n- The conditional call to resume_suspended_connections is guarded by an options flag; it affects runtime behaviour when the option is set and is therefore not dead.\n\n- The final call to internal_run_from_select and its returned value are the primary effect of the function; they are live and cannot be removed.\n\n- Any simple conditional returns (e.g. returning MHD_NO in various fail cases) directly affect control flow and program behaviour and so are not dead code.\n\nThe fragments reported above were chosen because they are operations that appear to be side-effect-only logging or possibly redundant calls (logging blocks, the INT_MAX clamp, and the epoll/cleanup pair) and therefore merit investigation to determine whether their execution is essential to the program behaviour (e.g. timing, diagnostics) or can be considered dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
