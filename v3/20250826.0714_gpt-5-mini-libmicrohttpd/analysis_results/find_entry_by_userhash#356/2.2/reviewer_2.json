True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nWhen algo3 is MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5 (or MD5_SESSION) the earlier test \"if (MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) != userhash_size) return NULL;\" already guarantees that userhash_size equals the MD5 hash size. Therefore the subsequent test \"if (sizeof(user_ids[0].userhash_md5) != userhash_size) return NULL;\" can never evaluate true in the current program and removing it would not change behavior. This makes that check dead code under the shown usage.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids dead code (operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour). The sizeof(...) != userhash_size checks in each case are defensive consistency checks: they compare a compile-time size of the table field to the runtime userhash_size (which was checked earlier against MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3)). There is no evidence in the snippet that MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) is provably identical to the compile-time sizeof(...) in all translation units of the project, so the extra test is not provably redundant. Removing those checks could change behaviour if the digest-size function, the enum-to-size mapping, or the user_ids definition become inconsistent (now or after future changes). Therefore the code is not demonstrably dead and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 on the basis given by Agent A."
