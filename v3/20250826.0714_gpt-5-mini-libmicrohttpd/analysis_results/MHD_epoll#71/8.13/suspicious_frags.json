  "explanation": "I selected all places where pointers (particularly epoll_event.data.ptr and the upgrade_marker definition) are stored, compared or converted \u2014 these are the locations most relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule because:\n\n- Most pointer uses in this function refer to mutable daemon/connection objects (e.g. accesses to pos->epoll_state, EDLL_insert/remove calls, call_handlers, MHD_connection_handle_idle, etc.). Those pointees are modified by the code, so qualifying the pointer target as const would be inappropriate.\n\n- The epoll API mandates a void * data pointer (struct epoll_event.data.ptr). Because the API requires a plain void * to carry user data, some conversions between typed pointers and void * are unavoidable; those API-driven uses are not candidates for adding a const qualifier without changing the API usage.\n\n- Comparisons and dispatch based on the event.data.ptr value are necessary to distinguish special marker values (listen socket, ITC marker, upgrade marker) from normal connection pointers; these comparisons are control-flow logic and not evidence by themselves that the pointee should be const.\n\nTherefore I focused on the lines that perform const->non-const dropping, assignment to the epoll data pointer, and places where the void* is reinterpreted back to typed pointers \u2014 these are the fragments that require investigation for potential Rule 8.13 violations."
