  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this function. Rationale:\n- The input character sequence is declared as const char *str, so the pointed-to type is const as required for read-only access.\n- The local alias is declared as const char *const start = str; this is a pointer to const data and the pointer itself is also const \u2014 compliant with the rule.\n- The out_val parameter is uint64_t *out_val and is written to via *out_val = res; since the function intentionally modifies the object pointed to, the pointed-to type must not be const; therefore no change is appropriate for Rule 8.13.\n- There are no other pointer parameters or pointer variables in the function that could be more const-qualified.\nAccordingly, there are no fragments that violate or should be investigated for Rule 8.13."
