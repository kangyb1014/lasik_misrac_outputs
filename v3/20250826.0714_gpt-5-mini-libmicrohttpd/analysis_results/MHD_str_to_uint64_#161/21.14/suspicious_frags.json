  "explanation": "I scanned the provided function and found no calls to memcmp nor any other Standard Library string-comparison functions (strcmp,strncmp,memcmp, etc.). The code performs character-by-character processing using pointer dereference and isasciidigit to detect digits, and uses numeric comparisons and arithmetic to build the uint64_t value. There are no comparisons of null-terminated strings via memcmp anywhere in this fragment, and no indirect evidence (e.g. wrapper functions or macros) in the shown code that would invoke memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
