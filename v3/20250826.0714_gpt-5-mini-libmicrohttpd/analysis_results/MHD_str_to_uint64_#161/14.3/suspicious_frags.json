  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function appears to be invariant. Specifically:\n- The initial if ( !str || !out_val || !isasciidigit(str[0]) ) uses function parameters and the first character; it is not invariant.\n- The do { ... } while (isasciidigit(*str)); loop\u2019s controlling expression depends on *str, which is incremented inside the loop (str++), so the expression is variant. It is not an invariant controlling expression and is not the permitted special-case do-while constant-false form.\n- The overflow check if ((res > (UINT64_MAX / 10)) || ((res == (UINT64_MAX / 10)) && ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 10)))) uses res and digit, both of which change during iteration, so this controlling expression is variant.\n- There are no other loops or conditional controlling expressions in the function. \nTherefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
