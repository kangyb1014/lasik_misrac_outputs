  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function is statically unreachable. Reasoning by region:\n\n- Declarations (const char *const start = str; uint64_t res;) are executed whenever the function is entered.\n\n- The input-check/early-return (if (! str || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0])) return 0;) can return for invalid inputs, but it does not render any subsequent code unreachable: for any call where str and out_val are non-NULL and str[0] is a digit, execution continues to the loop. The use of the || operator relies on left-to-right short-circuit evaluation, so isasciidigit(str[0]) is only evaluated when str is non-NULL.\n\n- The do { ... } while (isasciidigit (*str)); loop is entered at least once because the initial isasciidigit(str[0]) check succeeded; the loop body (digit computation, overflow test, res update, str++) is reachable for such inputs. The overflow test may cause an early return for some digit values, but that return is conditional and does not make other statements unreachable in general.\n\n- The assignments inside the loop (res *= 10; res += (unsigned int) digit; str++;) and the post-loop statements (*out_val = res; return (size_t) (str - start);) are reachable for inputs where the function does not early-return due to invalid input or overflow detection.\n\n- There are no constant conditions or compile-time-evaluable expressions that would make any branch or statement impossible to reach (the overflow condition depends on the runtime value of res and the parsed digit). \n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
