  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function, an enum return type, standard if/return statements, a ternary operator (may_block ? -1 : 0), and macro calls (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_). There are no GCC/Clang-specific keywords or built-ins (for example, no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions). Because the macro definitions themselves are not shown, they could potentially use extensions, but within this function body there is no direct use of any language extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
