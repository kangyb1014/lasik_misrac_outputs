Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining parts of the function (the function signature, parameter declarations, braces and simple flow structure) are structural and not candidates for dead code by themselves. There is no unreachable-code construct (e.g. code after a guaranteed non-return) visible here. The fragments listed above are the only places where removal or replacement could change behaviour (conditional choice of which polling function is called and the integer argument passed). Therefore other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 2.2 based on the provided code."
