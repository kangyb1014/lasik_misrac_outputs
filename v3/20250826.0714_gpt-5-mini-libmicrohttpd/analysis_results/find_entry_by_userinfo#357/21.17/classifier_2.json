  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any <string.h> functions, so by itself it does not violate Rule 21.17. However a violation can occur if the pointer passed is not a valid NUL-terminated string (or otherwise shorter than the callee expects) and find_entry_by_username uses standard string functions (e.g. strlen, strcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, memcmp, memcpy, etc.). For example, if username_info->username points to a buffer that is not NUL-terminated and find_entry_by_username calls strlen(username) or strcmp(username, \"...\"), those calls can read past the buffer bounds and violate Rule 21.17."
