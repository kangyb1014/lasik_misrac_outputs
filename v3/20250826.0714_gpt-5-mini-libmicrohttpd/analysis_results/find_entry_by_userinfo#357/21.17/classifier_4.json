A concrete violation scenario (not present here) would be if the pointed\u2011to buffer is not NUL\u2011terminated or is shorter than the code in find_entry_by_username expects and that function calls a string.h routine that reads past the buffer (for example, calling strlen(username) or strcpy(dest, username) when username points to an N\u2011byte buffer with no terminating '\\0' or when dest is too small)."
