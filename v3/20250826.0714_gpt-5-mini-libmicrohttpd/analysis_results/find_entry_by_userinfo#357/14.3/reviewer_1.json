In that case the second controlling expression (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type) is effectively always false (invariant) and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct in principle but incomplete. The second controlling expression can indeed be invariant (always false) in the context of the preceding return if and only if the numeric value of MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH is greater than or equal to MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD. If USERHASH >= STANDARD, any uname_type >= STANDARD causes the first if to return, so reaching the second if implies uname_type < STANDARD and therefore the equality comparison against USERHASH (>= STANDARD) is always false \u2014 a statically invariant controlling expression and thus a violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. However, if the enumeration/definitions guarantee that USERHASH < STANDARD (so the two conditions cover disjoint/value-ordered cases as intended), then the second expression is not invariant and there is no rule violation. Because the source excerpt does not show the definitions/values of those macros/enumerators, the report cannot be judged correct unconditionally. Recommendation: make the intent explicit (use else if, switch on uname_type, or add a static assertion about the enum ordering) to avoid any possibility of an invariant controlling expression and to remove ambiguity."
