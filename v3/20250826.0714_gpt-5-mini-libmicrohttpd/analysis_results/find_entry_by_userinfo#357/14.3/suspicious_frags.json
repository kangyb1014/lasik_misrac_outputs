  "explanation": "Only the conditional statements and the explicit fallback return are controlling points in this function and thus relevant to MISRA C Rule 14.3; they are reported above for investigation. Other parts of the function (the signature, parameter declarations, pointer dereferences, and the return statements inside the reported conditionals) are not additional controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other conditional constructs in the function beyond the fragments listed, so nothing else needs to be investigated for this rule."
