  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a return statement (fallback/exit), not a controlling expression. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (e.g. conditions of if/while/for/do-while). This line does not involve a controlling expression, so Rule 14.3 is not violated. (Note: the code comment about being unreachable may be pertinent to other rules but does not trigger Rule 14.3.)"
