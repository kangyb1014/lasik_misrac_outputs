  "explanation": "The only parts of this function relevant to possible unreachable code are the conditional branches and the final return that claims to be unreachable. Other fragments in the function (the signature, the calls to find_entry_by_username/find_entry_by_userhash, and the use of username_info fields) do not by themselves constitute unreachable code and thus do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1. Pointer validity or correctness of the helper functions are separate concerns (e.g. preconditions, null-pointer handling) but are not about unreachable code within this function, so they are excluded from this report."
