  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the presented code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function scope, pointer and struct types, const qualifier, member access (->), relational and equality operators, integer division (/), and return NULL. There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or other vendor-specific built-ins). Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
