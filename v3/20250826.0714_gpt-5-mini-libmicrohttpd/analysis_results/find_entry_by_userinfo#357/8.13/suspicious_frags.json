  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function (the uname_type comparisons, the MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_* macro usage, the final \"return NULL;\" and the comment) do not declare or pass pointer-to-object types that could/should be const-qualified under Rule 8.13, so they do not require further investigation. No other pointer variables or pointer-typed struct members appear in this function beyond the fragments listed above, hence no additional fragments need to be examined for possible const qualification."
