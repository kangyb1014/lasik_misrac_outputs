  "scenario": "The code passes username_info->userhash_bin where username_info is a const-qualified struct pointer. If the member userhash_bin is declared as a pointer to a non-const type (e.g. unsigned char *), the expression has type 'unsigned char * const' (the pointer is const but the pointee is not). This means the pointer points to mutable data and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 \u2014 the member should instead point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const unsigned char *) or the callee should accept a pointer-to-const."
