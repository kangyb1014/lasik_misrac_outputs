  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp appear in the provided function. The code performs only: (1) integer/enum comparisons of username_info->uname_type, and (2) calls out to other functions (find_entry_by_username, find_entry_by_userhash) without performing any string comparisons here. There are no direct comparisons of null\u2011terminated strings in this fragment (no use of memcmp or similar). Therefore no fragments in this function need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If needed, the called functions (find_entry_by_username and find_entry_by_userhash) should be inspected separately for memcmp usage."
