  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment calls connection->recv_cls (a read/recv callback), not any <string.h> function listed by MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17, so the rule (which strictly applies to memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/etc.) is not triggered. Note, however, a potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds risk exists if the invariant connection->read_buffer_offset <= connection->read_buffer_size is ever violated: if read_buffer_offset > read_buffer_size the subtraction wraps and a too\u2011large length would be passed to recv_cls, allowing writes beyond the buffer. That would be a buffer\u2011overflow bug (and would violate the spirit of 21.17 if a string.h function were used). To be defensive ensure read_buffer_offset <= read_buffer_size before the call."
