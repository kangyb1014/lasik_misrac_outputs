  "explanation": "I selected fragments that involve pointer values or string-returning calls where the pointee could reasonably be const-qualified (format strings, strings returned by helper functions such as MHD_state_to_string() or str_conn_error_(), and places where pointers are passed through APIs). These are the places most likely to benefit from reviewing whether the pointed-to types should be const-qualified.\n\nOther parts of the function were not included because they do not present candidates for 8.13: specifically\n- The 'connection' parameter and most uses of its members modify state (e.g. connection->read_buffer_offset, connection->discard_request, connection->read_closed, connection->read_buffer reassignment) so the pointee cannot be const-qualified.\n- Uses of the receive callback (recv_cls) that write into the provided buffer (e.g. &connection->read_buffer[...] and &dummy) are output buffers; their pointee must be non-const because data is written into them.\n- String literals (e.g. \"detected connection closure\") are inherently const-qualified by the language and do not require changes here (but their usage was included only where mixed with non-const-returning helpers in the same expression).\n- Control-flow statements, integer/enum comparisons, and return/assignment statements do not involve pointer-to-object types that would be made const by 8.13.\n\nIf required, reviewers should check the declarations of MHD_state_to_string, str_conn_error_, MHD_DLOG, MHD_pool_reallocate and CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR to confirm whether their pointer parameters/return types are const-correct; the fragments above point to where such adjustments would be relevant."
