  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning: the rule forbids modifying function parameters themselves (reassigning the parameter variables); pointer targets may be modified but the pointer parameter must not be changed. In this function: \n- There are no assignments to any parameter variable (no statements like cls = ..., connection = ..., url = ..., upload_data_size = ..., req_cls = ..., etc.).\n- There are no pointer arithmetic or increment/decrement operations on parameters.\n- There are no dereference-assignment operations that write through pointer parameters (e.g. *upload_data_size = ... or *req_cls = ...). The code only casts unused parameters to (void) to suppress warnings \u2014 this does not modify them.\n- Calls to library functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) pass pointer values but do not reassign the local parameter variables in this function; any modifications those functions perform would be to the objects pointed to (which is permitted), not to the parameter variables themselves.\n\nTherefore no code fragments in the provided function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
