  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines like (void) upload_data; are the standard idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA C\u20112023 Rule 2.2 targets dead code that is executed yet whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s observable behaviour at run time. Marking a parameter with (void) does not make the program\u2019s run\u2011time behaviour different from leaving the parameter name unused (and removing the cast only affects compiler diagnostics, not the program\u2019s observable behaviour). In short, these cast\u2011to\u2011void statements serve a documentation/diagnostic purpose and are not considered a Rule 2.2 violation in this context (and if the expression had side effects or referenced volatile objects, then removing it could affect behaviour \u2014 not the case here)."
