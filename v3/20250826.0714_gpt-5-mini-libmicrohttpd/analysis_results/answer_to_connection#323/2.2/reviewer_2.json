  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) upload_data_size; (and the other (void) parameter; lines) are an explicit idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and suppress compiler warnings. Although the expression has no effect on program state, MISRA\u2019s concern with Rule 2.2 is genuine dead-code (operations that are redundant, misleading, or that could be removed without any intended annotation). The void-cast is an intentional annotation and (in practice and in MISRA usage) is not treated as problematic dead code. In addition, such casts may be used to document intent and (in some embedded contexts) to preserve timing or side-effect semantics if the expression involved volatile objects; removing them can therefore change observable behaviour in corner cases. For those reasons the agent A\u2019s claim that this specific statement violates Rule 2.2 is not correct."
