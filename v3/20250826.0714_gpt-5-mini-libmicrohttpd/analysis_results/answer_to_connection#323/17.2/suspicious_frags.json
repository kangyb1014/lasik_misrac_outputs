  "explanation": "Only function calls can introduce direct or indirect self-calls; therefore all call expressions in this function have been flagged for investigation. The remaining code constructs do not involve calls and thus cannot create recursion: the (void) casts used to silence unused-parameter warnings, local variable declarations (page, response, ret), the const-cast of the page pointer, the string literal, and the final 'return ret;' statement are not callsites and cannot by themselves cause the function to call itself. There are no function-pointer invocations or callbacks written inline in this fragment beyond the listed calls; if any of the flagged library functions internally invoke the connection callback, that would be the source of indirect recursion and should be checked by inspecting their implementations or documentation."
