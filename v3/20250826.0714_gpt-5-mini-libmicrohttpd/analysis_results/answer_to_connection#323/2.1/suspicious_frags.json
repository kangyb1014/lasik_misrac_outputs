  "explanation": "No unreachable code patterns were found in the function. Specifically:\n- There are no early return statements preceding other executable statements (the single return is at the end of the function).\n- There are no unconditional jumps (goto), infinite loops, or break/continue statements that would make later code unreachable.\n- There are no constant-condition if/else constructs, no switch statements with unreachable case blocks, and no #if 0 / conditional compilation fragments in the provided code.\n- The (void) expressions are explicit no-op casts to silence unused-parameter warnings and are executed as expressions, not unreachable code.\n- Both branches of the if that checks MHD_add_response_header are reachable (the fprintf is executed only on failure), and the normal path continues to queue and destroy the response before returning.\n\nTherefore, with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code), there are no code fragments in this function that require further investigation."
