  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The pointer resp is passed to functions that create, modify and destroy the response (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response), so it must refer to a modifiable struct MHD_Response and cannot be const-qualified. A violation would occur if resp were only ever used for read-only operations (e.g. only passed to functions taking a const struct MHD_Response *) \u2014 in that case it should be declared as const struct MHD_Response *resp."
