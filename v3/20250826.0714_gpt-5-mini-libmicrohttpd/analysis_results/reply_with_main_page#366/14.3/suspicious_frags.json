  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in this function. The only conditional is: if (NULL == resp) \u2014 this depends on the result of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and therefore is not invariant. There are no loops (no for, while, or do-while) or other conditionals with constant or compile-time invariant expressions. The static initializers (page_content and page_content_len) are compile-time constants but are not controlling expressions and do not violate Rule 14.3. The cast-to-void of MHD_add_response_header and subsequent function calls do not introduce invariant controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this code."
