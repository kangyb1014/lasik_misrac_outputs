Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of reply_with_main_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreply_with_main_page (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  static const char page_content[] = MAIN_PAGE;\n  static const size_t page_content_len =\n    (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n  struct MHD_Response *resp;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  resp = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (page_content_len, page_content)\n  ;\n  if (NULL == resp)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  /* Ignore possible error when adding the header as the reply will work even\n     without this header. */\n  (void) MHD_add_response_header (resp,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                                  \"text/html\");\n\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (c, MHD_HTTP_OK, resp);\n  MHD_destroy_response (resp);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic const size_t page_content_len =\n    (sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char)) - 1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The static const variable page_content_len is initialized (compile-time) and then used in the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static. Initialization is not considered an assignment per MISRA note 3, and the initializer is not removable without changing program behaviour. Therefore this fragment is not dead code. (If page_content_len were never referenced, that would constitute dead code because removing it would not affect behaviour.)"
