  "explanation": "Other pointer occurrences in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the input string pointer is declared const (const char *str) and the local alias is declared as a pointer-to-const with a const pointer qualifier (const char *const start = str). There are no other pointer declarations in the function. Pointer arithmetic and dereferencing of the const-qualified string are consistent with pointing to a const-qualified type, so they comply with the rule and do not require further inspection."
