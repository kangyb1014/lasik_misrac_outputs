Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_strx_to_uint64_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_strx_to_uint64_ (const char *str,\n                     uint64_t *out_val)\n{\n  const char *const start = str;\n  uint64_t res;\n  int digit;\n  if (! str || ! out_val)\n    return 0;\n\n  res = 0;\n  digit = toxdigitvalue (*str);\n  while (digit >= 0)\n  {\n    if ( (res < (UINT64_MAX / 16)) ||\n         ((res == (UINT64_MAX / 16)) &&\n          ( (uint64_t) digit <= (UINT64_MAX % 16)) ) )\n    {\n      res *= 16;\n      res += (unsigned int) digit;\n    }\n    else\n      return 0;\n    str++;\n    digit = toxdigitvalue (*str);\n  }\n\n  if (str - start > 0)\n    *out_val = res;\n  return (size_t) (str - start);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndigit = toxdigitvalue (*str);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment 'digit = toxdigitvalue(*str);' initializes 'digit' which is immediately used in the loop condition 'while (digit >= 0)' and therefore affects control flow. Removing this operation would change program behavior (it would alter whether the loop is entered), so it is not dead code."
