  "explanation": "I examined all controlling expressions in the function: \n\n- while (digit >= 0)\n  - 'digit' is assigned before the loop and re-assigned at the end of each iteration via digit = toxdigitvalue(*str); 'str' is incremented in the loop. Thus the controlling expression is not invariant. \n\n- The nested if controlling expression\n  if ( (res < (UINT64_MAX / 16)) || ((res == (UINT64_MAX / 16)) && ((uint64_t) digit <= (UINT64_MAX % 16)) ) )\n  - depends on 'res' and 'digit'; both are updated inside the loop (res is modified when digits are accumulated and digit is reassigned from the advancing 'str'), so this expression is not invariant.\n\n- The initial guard if (! str || ! out_val) and the final if (str - start > 0) both depend on function inputs and/or the computed 'str' pointer; they are not compile-time invariants.\n\nNo controlling expression in this function is syntactically or semantically invariant (constant) across iterations or execution. The loop condition and selection conditions rely on values that are updated within the function, so none require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
