First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops (the three clauses of a for statement and the single loop counter requirements). The function uses a while loop (while (digit >= 0)) and no macros or hidden constructs in the shown text expand to a for loop. Therefore there are no code fragments to investigate for compliance with Rule 14.2 in this snippet.\n\nNote: Although the while loop body calls toxdigitvalue() and modifies objects (res, str, digit), those concerns fall outside Rule 14.2 (which targets for loops). If you want analysis against other MISRA rules (e.g. side effects in loop conditions, use of functions with side effects, or loop termination checks), specify the rule and I will identify relevant fragments."
