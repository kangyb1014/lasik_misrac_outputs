  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific or nonstandard language extensions in the provided function. Reasons: \n\n- Fixed-width integer types (uint64_t, UINT64_MAX) and size_t are standard C (C99 and later) types/macros from the standard headers (stdint.h, stddef.h). Their use is not a compiler extension.\n- The second const in \"const char *const start = str;\" is standard C syntax for a const pointer-to-const data, not an extension.\n- Pointer arithmetic (str - start), pointer dereference (*str), and pointer increment (str++) are standard C operations.\n- The casts ((uint64_t) digit), ((unsigned int) digit) and the explicit cast to (size_t) are standard C cast expressions.\n- Control structures used (if, while) and the loop logic are standard C constructs.\n- The identifier toxdigitvalue appears to be a user/library function or macro, not a compiler extension; its usage here is a normal function call.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (no __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, __extension__, typeof, __int128, __builtin_*, or other vendor-specific tokens).\n\nBecause none of the code constructs rely on documented compiler extensions, there are no code fragments that need to be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
