  "explanation": "I included every C controlling expression present in the function (the switch and all if conditions). Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions, so these are the places to inspect for potential invariance (including those that call macros which may expand to compile-time constants). I did not include non-controlling statements (assignments, function calls, XDLL_* calls, va_start/va_arg, returns) because they are not controlling expressions subject to this rule. Preprocessor conditionals (#if / #ifdef) were not listed because the MISRA rule addresses C controlling expressions rather than preprocessor directives; the conditional compilation lines are already visible in the code and do not need separate listing here."
