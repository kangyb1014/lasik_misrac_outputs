  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code contains only standard C constructs: a static function definition, preprocessor conditionals (#if / #else / #endif), function calls, and casts to void *. The MHD_* identifiers are library macros/functions (not language extensions) and a function\u2011like macro (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) is a standard preprocessor feature rather than a compiler language extension. The explicit casts (void *) are standard C and not a compiler-specific extension (though they may hide constness issues, that is not a Rule 1.2 language-extension concern). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords or pragmas in the snippet, so nothing here needs investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
