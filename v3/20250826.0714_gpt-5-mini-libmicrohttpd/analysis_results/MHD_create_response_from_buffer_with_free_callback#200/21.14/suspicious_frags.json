  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided function only forwards its arguments to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls and performs no comparisons or string operations itself. There is no use of memcmp or any other library string-comparison routine in this snippet, and the buffer parameter is declared as void* (no assumption of a null-terminated string can be made here). Therefore nothing in this code fragment triggers MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If checking for memcmp usage is required, inspect the implementation of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls or other code not included here.)"
