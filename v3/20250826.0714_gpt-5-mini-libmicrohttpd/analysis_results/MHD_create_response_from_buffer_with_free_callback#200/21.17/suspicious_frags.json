  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function invoke any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) or perform any pointer arithmetic or memory accesses that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. The function is a simple wrapper that forwards the size and buffer parameters to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls without inspecting or manipulating the buffer; therefore there is no direct use of string-handling operations in this fragment to evaluate against MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Any potential violation of Rule 21.17 would have to be investigated inside the implementation of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (which is not part of the provided code)."
