  "explanation": "Other parts of the snippet do not need investigation for MISRA C: the parameter 'size_t size' is not a pointer and thus outside the scope of Rule 8.13; the token '_MHD_EXTERN' is a linkage/storage macro and not related to pointer const-qualification; the parameter declared as a function-pointer type (MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc) is a function pointer rather than a pointer to object data, and const-qualification rules for object pointers do not apply in the same way to function-pointer types; the function return type 'struct MHD_Response *' is a pointer to a response object that is typically intended to be modified by the caller (i.e. not a candidate for adding const in usual API designs). Therefore those fragments need not be flagged here."
