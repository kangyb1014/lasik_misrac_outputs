  "explanation": "Only the two fragments above need investigation for possible indirect recursion: the function declaration (its name) and the single return that calls another function. There is no direct self-call in this snippet, no invocation of the callback parameter (crfc) here, and no other control flow or function calls present that could create recursion. The only possible MISRA Rule 17.2 concern is whether the called function MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (or any callback invoked within that call) calls back, directly or indirectly, to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback. Therefore other parts of the snippet (parameter declarations, braces, typedef name, and the simple pass-through of arguments) do not need investigation based on the provided code."
