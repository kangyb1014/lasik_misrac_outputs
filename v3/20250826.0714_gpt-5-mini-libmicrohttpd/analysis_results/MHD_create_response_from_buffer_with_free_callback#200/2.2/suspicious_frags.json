  "explanation": "The function body contains a single executed operation (a call forwarding to the _cls variant). There are no conditional branches, unreachable blocks, unused local variables or assignments in this code fragment beyond that single call, so no other lines in the snippet present indications of dead code. The parameters and macro appear only as part of the public wrapper and are used directly in the call, so they are not themselves dead code. The only items that warrant investigation are the wrapper function (and specifically the forwarded call and the duplicated 'buffer' argument) to determine if the wrapper is ever used or if the forwarded argument(s) cause an operation that could be removed without changing behavior. No other fragments in the provided snippet meet the definition of executed-but-removable code."
