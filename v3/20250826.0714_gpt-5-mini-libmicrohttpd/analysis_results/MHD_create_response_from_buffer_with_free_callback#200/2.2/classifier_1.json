  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback (size_t size,\n                                                    void *buffer,\n                                                    MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback\n                                                    crfc)\n{\n  return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 crfc,\n                                                                 buffer);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 crfc,\n                                                                 buffer);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is a simple forwarding call (API wrapper) that returns the result of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls(size, buffer, crfc, buffer). This operation is executed and affects behavior (it performs the response creation and passes parameters to the underlying implementation and preserves the API/symbol). Removing the call or the wrapper would change program behaviour (and possibly linkage/API), so it is not dead code."
