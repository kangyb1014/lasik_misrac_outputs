  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function. The function consists only of the signature, a single return statement that calls MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls, and the enclosing braces. There are no conditional branches, loops, labels, or statements after the return that could be unreachable. The leading macro (_MHD_EXTERN) is a linkage/visibility specifier and does not introduce unreachable code in this context. The parameters (size, buffer, crfc) are all used in the single call, so there are no unused-parameter bodies or dead parameter handling here. Therefore, there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
