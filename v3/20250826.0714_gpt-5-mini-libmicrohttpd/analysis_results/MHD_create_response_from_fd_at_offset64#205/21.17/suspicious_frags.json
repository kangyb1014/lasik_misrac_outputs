  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function use any of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The snippet contains only integer arithmetic and bounds checks, assignments, and a call to MHD_create_response_from_callback. Integer arithmetic and casts are not within the scope of Rule 21.17. The only possible places to inspect for string-handling issues would be the implementations of MHD_create_response_from_callback, file_reader, or free_callback (which are called from this code) \u2014 those definitions are not present in this snippet and would need to be examined separately if available. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
