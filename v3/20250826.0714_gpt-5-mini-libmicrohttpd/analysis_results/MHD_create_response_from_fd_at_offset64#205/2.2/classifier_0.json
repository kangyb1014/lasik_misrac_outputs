Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 (uint64_t size,\n                                         int fd,\n                                         uint64_t offset)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n#if ! defined(HAVE___LSEEKI64) && ! defined(HAVE_LSEEK64)\n  if ( (sizeof(uint64_t) > sizeof(off_t)) &&\n       ( (size > (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ||\n         (offset > (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ||\n         ((size + offset) >= (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ) )\n    return NULL;\n#endif\n  if ( ((int64_t) size < 0) ||\n       ((int64_t) offset < 0) ||\n       ((int64_t) (size + offset) < 0) )\n    return NULL;\n\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_callback (size,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &file_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = fd;\n  response->is_pipe = false;\n  response->fd_off = offset;\n  response->crc_cls = response;\n  return response;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresponse = MHD_create_response_from_callback (size,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &file_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The null-check after calling MHD_create_response_from_callback is not dead code. Removing the call or the subsequent if-check would change program behaviour if MHD_create_response_from_callback can return NULL (it prevents later dereferencing of response). There is no evidence in the fragment that the function can never return NULL, so this branch is a valid runtime check and not a violation of Rule 2.2."
