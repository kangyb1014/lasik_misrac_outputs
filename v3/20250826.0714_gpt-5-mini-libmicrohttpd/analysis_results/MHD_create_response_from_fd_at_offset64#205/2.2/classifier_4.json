Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 (uint64_t size,\n                                         int fd,\n                                         uint64_t offset)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n#if ! defined(HAVE___LSEEKI64) && ! defined(HAVE_LSEEK64)\n  if ( (sizeof(uint64_t) > sizeof(off_t)) &&\n       ( (size > (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ||\n         (offset > (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ||\n         ((size + offset) >= (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) ) )\n    return NULL;\n#endif\n  if ( ((int64_t) size < 0) ||\n       ((int64_t) offset < 0) ||\n       ((int64_t) (size + offset) < 0) )\n    return NULL;\n\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_callback (size,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &file_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = fd;\n  response->is_pipe = false;\n  response->fd_off = offset;\n  response->crc_cls = response;\n  return response;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresponse->fd_off = offset;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not a violation: the assignment response->fd_off = offset stores the requested start offset in the response object and is expected to be read later by the file_reader callback when serving the response. Removing it would change program behaviour (files would be served from the wrong offset), so it is not dead code. A violation would occur only if fd_off is never read or is always overwritten before any read (for example if the file_reader callback ignores fd_off or always sets fd_off to another value prior to use), in which case this assignment would be dead code."
