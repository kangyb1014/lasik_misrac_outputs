  "explanation": "I flagged all conditional checks, the response-creation call (and its immediate NULL check), and the direct assignments to fields of response because they are potential places where code might be redundant or have no effect in some build/configurations \u2014 these should be investigated for dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2.\n\nOther fragments in the function are not reported because they are standard, necessary elements that are unlikely to be dead code: the function signature and linkage macro (_MHD_EXTERN and the function prototype), the local declaration (struct MHD_Response *response;), and the final return (return response;) are essential for function operation and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. Simple syntactic elements (braces, indentation, parameter names) and the use of MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE as a parameter within the flagged call are not separately suspicious beyond the call itself and thus were not listed."
