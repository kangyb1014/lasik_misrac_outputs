  "explanation": "I examined the entire setup_reply_properties function for any use of the Standard Library string handling routines listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). No calls to those functions (or any other string.h functions) appear in the code fragment. The function only accesses struct members, evaluates flags/enum values, calls macros (mhd_assert, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT) and performs scalar assignments and comparisons. There is no pointer arithmetic, buffer copying, concatenation, length computation or any operation that would read from or write to character arrays via string.h routines. Conditional compilation blocks do not introduce string handling either. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
