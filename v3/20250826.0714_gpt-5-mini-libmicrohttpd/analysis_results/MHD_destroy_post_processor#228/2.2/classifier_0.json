  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_destroy_post_processor:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_destroy_post_processor (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  if (NULL == pp)\n    return MHD_YES;\n  if (PP_ProcessValue == pp->state)\n  {\n    /* key without terminated value left at the end of the\n       buffer; fake receiving a termination character to\n       ensure it is also processed */\n    post_process_urlencoded (pp,\n                             \"\\n\",\n                             1);\n  }\n  /* These internal strings need cleaning up since\n     the post-processing may have been interrupted\n     at any stage */\n  if ( (pp->xbuf_pos > 0) ||\n       ( (pp->state != PP_Done) &&\n         (pp->state != PP_Init) ) )\n    ret = MHD_NO;\n  else\n    ret = MHD_YES;\n  pp->have = NE_none;\n  free_unmarked (pp);\n  if (NULL != pp->nested_boundary)\n    free (pp->nested_boundary);\n  free (pp);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfree (pp);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call free(pp) is executed on the non-NULL path and releases heap memory allocated for the post-processor. Removing it would change program behaviour (cause a memory leak, alter resource consumption and possibly lead to later failures), so it is not dead code."
