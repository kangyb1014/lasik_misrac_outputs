  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment pp->have = NE_none; is executed on every path where pp is non-NULL. The only early return (return MHD_YES) occurs if pp == NULL, so the statement is reachable for all remaining control-flow paths (including after the conditional call to post_process_urlencoded and after ret is set). Therefore the fragment is not unreachable and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
