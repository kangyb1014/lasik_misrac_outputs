  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: addr is already declared as a pointer to const (const struct sockaddr_storage *addr); &daemon->new_connections_mutex and the subsequent mutex lock/unlock calls operate on a mutable mutex and must accept a non-const pointer; daemon is actively modified in this function (e.g. daemon->have_new = true and list insertions), so making it a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate; client_socket and other scalar parameters are not pointer types; calls that close sockets or set errno do not involve pointer-to-data that could be const-qualified. The selected fragments are the pointer-typed usages in this function that could plausibly be considered for const-qualification and thus warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
