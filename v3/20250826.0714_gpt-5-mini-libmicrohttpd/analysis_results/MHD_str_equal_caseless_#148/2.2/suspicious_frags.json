  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function appears to constitute dead code under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. Rationale:\n- There is no unreachable code (the loop, the if/else, and the final return are all reachable depending on inputs). Note 2 in the rule differentiates unreachable code from dead code. \n- Every executed operation affects program behaviour: the while condition controls iteration, charsequalcaseless(c1, c2) determines equality and thus flow, the increments (str1++ / str2++) advance the pointers and are necessary for correct comparison, and the final return inspects *str2 to determine equality length-wise. Removing any of those would change observable behaviour. \n- The local declarations/initializations (const char c1 = *str1; const char c2 = *str2;) are initializations; per Rule Note 3 initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is not a candidate for dead code. Even if one considered replacing them by direct uses of *str1 and *str2, that would be a refactor rather than true dead code \u2014 the current initializations are used immediately and affect subsequent operations. \nGiven the above, there are no operations executed whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so no fragments require further investigation for Rule 2.2."
