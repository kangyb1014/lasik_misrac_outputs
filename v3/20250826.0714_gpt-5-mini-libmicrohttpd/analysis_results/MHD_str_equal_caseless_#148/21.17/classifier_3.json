  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for Rule 21.17: the fragment const char c1 = *str1; does not call any function from <string.h>, and Rule 21.17 specifically targets use of the string.h library functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). However, the code can still produce an out-of-bounds access if the pointer is invalid (e.g. str1 == NULL) or if str1 does not point to a NUL\u2011terminated object (the loop will continue reading past the intended object). Such pointer/null\u2011termination problems are undefined behavior and violate other MISRA rules, but they are not a direct violation of Rule 21.17."
