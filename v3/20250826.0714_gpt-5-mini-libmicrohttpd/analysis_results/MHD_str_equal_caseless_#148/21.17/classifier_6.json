  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. That rule concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). The fragment return 0 == (*str2); does not call any <string.h> function, so 21.17 does not apply. Note: the code can still be unsafe if str2 is NULL or not a valid NUL-terminated string (or if earlier loop already dereferenced past str2's terminator), which would be a general out-of-bounds/undefined-behavior issue, but it is not a violation of rule 21.17."
