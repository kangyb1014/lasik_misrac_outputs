  "explanation": "This function does not call any of the <string.h> routines named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). The only potential causes of out-of-bounds accesses relevant to that rule in this function are reads and advances of the pointer parameters and the function signature itself; those specific locations are listed above for investigation. All other fragments in the function are simple control-flow or trivial returns (braces, the else return 0; the function prologue/epilogue syntax) and do not introduce additional risks covered by Rule 21.17 beyond the pointer dereferences/increments already reported."
