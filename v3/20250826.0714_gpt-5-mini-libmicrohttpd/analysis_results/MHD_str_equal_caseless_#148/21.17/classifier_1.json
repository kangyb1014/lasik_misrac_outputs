  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the code fragment does not call any functions from <string.h>. The increment (str2++) is only executed after a successful character comparison and, for well-formed null-terminated strings, cannot advance str2 beyond the terminating NUL (the loop exits when *str1 == '\\0'). While dereferencing/incrementing an invalid or non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated str2 could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds access, that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which specifically addresses misuse of the <string.h> functions)."
