  "scenario": "The code fragment calls charsequalcaseless(c1, c2) with two char values extracted from *str1 and *str2. Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. This fragment does not call any <string.h> function, so it does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: there is a separate potential issue: the code reads *str2 without checking str2 is non\u2011NULL or that str2 is at least as long as str1, which could cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read, but that is not a violation of Rule 21.17 since no <string.h> function is used.)"
