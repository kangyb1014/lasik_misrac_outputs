  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression depends on the value of daemon->options at runtime (daemon is a pointer to the daemon instance) and therefore is not invariant. (It would only violate Rule 14.3 if daemon->options were in fact an invariant/compile-time constant\u2014e.g. a macro or a truly constant object whose value cannot change\u2014making the condition always true or always false.)"
