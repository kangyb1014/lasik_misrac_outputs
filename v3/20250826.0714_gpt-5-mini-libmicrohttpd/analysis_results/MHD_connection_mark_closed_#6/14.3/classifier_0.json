  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the controlling expression depends on the runtime value daemon->options (bitwise test of a runtime field), so it is not necessarily invariant. (A violation would occur if daemon->options were a compile-time constant or always the same value \u2014 e.g. replaced by a literal 0 or a #define that never changes \u2014 making the condition always true/false.)"
