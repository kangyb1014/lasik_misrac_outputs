  "explanation": "The fragments selected involve conditional compilation (#ifdef/#endif) interleaved with if/else statements and two distinct shutdown() calls; such preprocessing-driven splitting of a control structure and the duplicated/paired shutdown calls are the primary places where control flow could become non-obvious or potentially unreachable depending on build-time options or macro definitions. Other parts of the function are simple and clearly reachable: the local daemon pointer initialization, the final assignments to connection->state and connection->event_loop_info, and the function header/braces do not present apparent unreachable-code issues and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
