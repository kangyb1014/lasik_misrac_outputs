  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The fragments in the function are limited to: assigning the daemon pointer, bitmask checks on daemon->options, a call to MHD_tls_connection_shutdown, calls to the system shutdown() API, and setting connection->state and connection->event_loop_info. None of these operations use or imply accesses via pointer parameters to standard string handling routines, so they do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Note: MHD_tls_connection_shutdown is an external function; if investigation is required for string handling, that function (and any other called functions) should be reviewed separately, but there are no inline uses of <string.h> APIs in this code fragment to report."
