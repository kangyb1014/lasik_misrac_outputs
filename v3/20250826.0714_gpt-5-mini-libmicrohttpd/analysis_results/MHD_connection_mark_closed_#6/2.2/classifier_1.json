  "scenario": "Cannot determine from the fragment alone. The assignment is not necessarily dead: it is required if other code reads connection->event_loop_info after this function returns. However, it would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 if the stored value is never read before being overwritten or before the object is discarded. Example violating scenario: every reader of connection->event_loop_info either reads it before this function is called or this field is always overwritten later (without any intervening read), so removing the assignment would not change program behaviour. To confirm, search the codebase for all reads of connection->event_loop_info and use a static data-flow analysis (write-without-read detection) \u2014 if no reads occur after this write, the assignment is dead and must be removed or justified."
