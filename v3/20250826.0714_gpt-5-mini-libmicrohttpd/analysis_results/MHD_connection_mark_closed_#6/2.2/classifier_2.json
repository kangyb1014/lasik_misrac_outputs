Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_mark_closed_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_connection_mark_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n\n  if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO))\n  {\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n    /* For TLS connection use shutdown of TLS layer\n     * and do not shutdown TCP socket.

  "scenario": "The shutdown(connection->socket_fd, SHUT_WR) call is reachable and affects behaviour. It is executed when daemon->options does not include MHD_USE_TURBO and either HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined, or (when HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined) the MHD_USE_TLS option is not set. (When HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined and MHD_USE_TLS is set, a different shutdown call is invoked only if MHD_tls_connection_shutdown() fails.) Removing this shutdown would change socket closure/timing in those cases, so it is not dead code."
