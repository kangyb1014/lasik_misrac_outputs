  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function depend on variables that are modified at runtime and therefore are not invariant: for example, the while loops use the changing index r (while (unquoted_len > r)), and the various if tests compare parameters or the write index w which is incremented (if (unquoted_len * 2 <= buf_size), if (unquoted_len > buf_size), if (buf_size <= w), etc.). Those expressions can evaluate differently across iterations/calls and so do not violate the \u2018controlling expressions shall not be invariant\u2019 constraint. The only fragment needing investigation is the constant controlling expression shown above (it appears only when the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE configuration is active)."
