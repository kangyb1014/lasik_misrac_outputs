  "scenario": "The controlling expression is the constant expression `1` in `if (1)` (under the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE configuration). This is an invariant controlling expression that is always true and is not used to create an infinite loop nor is it a do-while with a false integer constant \u2014 therefore it falls outside the permitted exceptions to Rule 14.3 and violates the rule."
