  "explanation": "The rest of the function does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and therefore those parts are not relevant to that rule. The local declaration 'size_t i;' and the return statements ('return 0;' and 'return ! 0;') do not perform pointer dereferences or buffer accesses beyond those shown above. The call to charsequalcaseless operates on individual char values (not pointer-based string handling functions) and so does not by itself trigger Rule 21.17. The flagged fragments cover the function parameters (pointer inputs) and the indexed accesses within the loop, which are the places that must be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
