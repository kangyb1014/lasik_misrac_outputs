  "scenario": "The loop itself does not call any <string.h> functions. Therefore it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which specifically constrains use of the standard string.h functions). Note, however, a potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds access exists: if the caller supplies a len greater than the actual allocated size (or the actual null-terminated length) of str1 or str2, then indexing str1[i] or str2[i] for i in 0..len-1 would access beyond the objects\u2019 bounds. That would be a bounds violation (and must be prevented), but it is not a direct breach of Rule 21.17 since no <string.h> function is used."
