  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function appear to be invariant in the sense intended by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\n- The for-loop controlling expression (i < len) is not invariant: i is initialized before the loop and is incremented (++i) on each iteration, so the expression can change and the loop will normally terminate when i reaches len. Even though for a particular call with len == 0 the condition is false initially, that does not make the loop\u2019s controlling expression invariant across the general case.\n\n- The if controlling expression (charsequalcaseless(c1, c2)) is not invariant: c1 and c2 are assigned fresh values from str1[i] and str2[i] on every iteration, so the result of the test can change between iterations.\n\n- There are no do-while loops with a constant false controlling expression (the permitted exception), nor any apparent intentionally infinite loops with a constant true condition. No other control statements (while, do-while, switch) exist whose controlling expressions are constant or unchanged throughout the loop body.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that require further investigation under Rule 14.3."
