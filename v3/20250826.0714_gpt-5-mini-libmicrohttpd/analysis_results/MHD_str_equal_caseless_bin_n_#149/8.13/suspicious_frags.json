  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameters are declared as const char *const (pointer to const-qualified type, and the pointer itself is const), so the pointers already point to const-qualified types. There are no other pointer variables or pointer casts in this function to inspect: index access uses str1[i] and str2[i] for read-only access, local variables c1 and c2 are plain char (non-pointer) copies, and the call to charsequalcaseless passes char values (not pointers). Therefore no code in this snippet violates or potentially violates Rule 8.13 and nothing else in the fragment requires investigation."
