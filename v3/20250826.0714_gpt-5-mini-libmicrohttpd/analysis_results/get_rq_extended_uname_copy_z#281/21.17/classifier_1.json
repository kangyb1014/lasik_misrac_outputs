  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment calls a project-specific function (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) rather than a <string.h> library function; MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies specifically to the standard <string.h> functions. In addition, earlier checks ensure uname_ext_len >= MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN, and that minimum length is intended to be at least the prefix length returned by MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX), so the comparison will not read beyond the uname_ext object. A violation would occur only if MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN were smaller than the prefix length or if MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ itself accessed more bytes than permitted, but neither is evidenced in the shown fragment."
