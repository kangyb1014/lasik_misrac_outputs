  "explanation": "The rest of the function's operations are protected by explicit bounds checks and do not appear to risk accesses beyond object bounds:\n- The initial check ((size_t) SSIZE_MAX < uname_ext_len) prevents uname_ext_len from exceeding SSIZE_MAX so subsequent conversions to ssize_t are safe.\n- The while loop that inspects uname_ext[r] is guarded by the condition r < uname_ext_len, preventing out-of-range reads while scanning the language tag.\n- After the loop there is a check if (r >= uname_ext_len) return -1; so any use of r after that is safe (and r++ is handled so that uname_ext + r with length uname_ext_len - r is well-defined, possibly zero-length).\n- mhd_assert(SSIZE_MAX > w) documents an expectation about w's range (though it is not a runtime guard, it is not a source of additional out-of-bounds access by itself).\n\nThe only fragments requiring further investigation relative to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are the calls to the string/percent-decode helper functions (which may read from uname_ext without being given uname_ext_len) and the explicit termination write buf[w] = 0 (which may write past buf if the decoder returns a length equal to buf_size or if buf_size == 0). Other reads/writes in the function are covered by the shown bounds checks."
