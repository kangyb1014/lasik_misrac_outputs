  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Details:\n- Pointer parameters: uname_ext and buf are never reassigned (no statements like uname_ext = ..., buf = ... or pointer arithmetic that updates the parameter variables). The use of uname_ext[r] and passing uname_ext + r to a function only reads from uname_ext (does not modify the pointer parameter itself). Passing pointer expressions as arguments does not violate Rule 17.8.\n- Objects pointed to by pointer parameters: buf[w] = 0 writes to the object pointed to by buf. This is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified).\n- Non-pointer parameters (uname_ext_len, buf_size) are not modified; local variables r and w are used for indexing and loop control.\n- No casts or operations are present that alter the pointer parameters or remove const from uname_ext.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
