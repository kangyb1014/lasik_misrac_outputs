  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments because they perform observable input validation, parsing, error handling or essential result construction and therefore cannot be removed without changing program behaviour: \n- The initial length checks and prefix check (casts and MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) prevent out-of-range and malformed inputs and are necessary for correct control flow. \n- r = MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(...) and the following while loop (including the r++ after the loop) implement language-tag skipping; removing these would change parsing and program behaviour. \n- The percent-decode call and its subsequent error check (if ((0 == w) && (0 != uname_ext_len - r)) return -1;) determine whether decoding succeeded and are required. \n- The buf[w] = 0; line null-terminates the output buffer; removing it would change the produced string and thus behaviour. \n- The final cast and return ((ssize_t) w) produce the expected return type and value. \nThe two fragments I flagged should be investigated because they may be semantically redundant or intentionally no-op in some builds: the local temporary const char assignment is an extra operation that could be eliminated without changing behavior (the comparisons could index uname_ext[r] directly), and the assertion macro may be a no-op in production builds (an executed operation that does not affect program behaviour), so both warrant review for potential 'dead' operations under MISRA Rule 2.2."
