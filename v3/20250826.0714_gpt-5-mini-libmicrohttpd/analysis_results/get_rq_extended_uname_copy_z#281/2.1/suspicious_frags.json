Other fragments in the function are simple declarations or straightforward assignments (e.g. \"size_t r; size_t w;\" and \"r = MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX);\") or comments and do not by themselves create unreachable code paths, so they need not be investigated further for reachability."
