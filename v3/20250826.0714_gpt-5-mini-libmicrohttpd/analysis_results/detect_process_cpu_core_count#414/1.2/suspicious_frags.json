  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n\n- There are no use of compiler-specific keywords or attributes such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, __inline (compiler-specific), or similar extensions.\n- There are no GNU extensions like nested functions, statement expressions ({ ...; }) used as expressions, or designated initializers with non-standard syntax.\n- There is no inline assembly, no pragmas that are compiler-specific, and no use of nonstandard calling-convention specifiers (e.g., __stdcall, __cdecl).\n- The code uses standard C constructs only: function with prototype (void), standard storage-class specifier (static), ordinary integer types, casts, conditional (?:) operator, and standard library functions fprintf/printf. Adjacent string literal concatenation is a standard C feature.\n- All format specifiers used (%d, %u) match the argument types (int and unsigned int respectively after cast), and casting of res to unsigned int is standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions detected)."
