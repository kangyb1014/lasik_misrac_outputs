  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment alone \u2014 pos is used to traverse the linked list and the function returns a mutable pointer. The code as shown does not inherently violate Rule 8.13. A concrete violation would be: if the header objects are intended to be immutable (the function does not and should not modify them and the public API should present them as read-only), then pos and the function return type should be const (e.g. const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos and return const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *). In that case the current non-const pointer would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
