  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect calls back into the same function. The only places that can introduce indirect recursion are function (or macro) calls. The remaining code constructs \u2014 the function signature, local variable declarations, the for-loop traversal (pos = response->first_header; pos = pos->next), simple comparisons (pos->header_size == key_len, kind == pos->kind), and the return statements \u2014 do not perform function calls themselves and therefore cannot introduce recursion. Hence only the call expressions present in the function need investigation for possible indirect self-calls."
