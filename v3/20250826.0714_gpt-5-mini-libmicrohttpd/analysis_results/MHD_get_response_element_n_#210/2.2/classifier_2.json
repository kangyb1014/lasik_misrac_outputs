Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_element_n_:\n```c\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *\nMHD_get_response_element_n_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key,\n                             size_t key_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != key);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key[0]);\n  mhd_assert (0 != key_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_len) &&\n        (kind == pos->kind) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (NULL != key);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "This assert does not necessarily violate Rule 2.2, but it can in a specific situation. If mhd_assert expands to code that is executed in the build (i.e. it evaluates the condition) but has no observable effect when the condition is true (no side-effects, no logging, no abort), and the API/contract guarantees that key is always non-NULL (so the condition is always true at run-time), then the assertion is an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 that would be dead code and thus violate Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert can change behaviour (e.g. aborts on failure or performs diagnostics/logging), then removal would affect behaviour and there is no violation."
