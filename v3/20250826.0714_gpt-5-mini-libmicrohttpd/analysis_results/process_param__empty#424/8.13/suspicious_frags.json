  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this fragment is the function parameter declared as const char *param_name, which already satisfies the requirement to point to a const-qualified type. There are no other pointer declarations, pointer assignments, or returned pointer values in the code. Uses of param_name (passing to fprintf and indexing param_name[1]) do not modify the pointed-to data and are compatible with the const qualification. Therefore no code in this fragment needs further investigation for Rule 8.13."
