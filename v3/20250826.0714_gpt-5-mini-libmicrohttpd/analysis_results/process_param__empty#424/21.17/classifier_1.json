  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment does not call any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which constrains use of those library string functions) is not applicable. Note: the code does index param_name[1], which can be out-of-bounds or undefined behavior if param_name is NULL or points to a buffer shorter than 2 bytes \u2014 that would violate other MISRA rules about pointer validity/bounds, but it is not a violation of Rule 21.17."
