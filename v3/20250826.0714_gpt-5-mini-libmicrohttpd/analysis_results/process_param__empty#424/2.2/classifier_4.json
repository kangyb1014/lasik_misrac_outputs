Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__empty:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__empty (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.tiny)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-T' or '--tiny'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.large)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-L' or '--large'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.empty = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The ternary expression returns one of two enum values based on param_name[1]; as written this is not dead code because removing the test would change behaviour for callers that sometimes pass a name whose second character is '-' and sometimes not. A violation would occur only if, by program design or proven invariants, param_name[1] can never be '-' (or is always '-') \u2014 in that case the never-taken branch would be dead code. No such invariant is present in the fragment, so we cannot conclude dead code here."
