  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be unreachable under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1. Reasoning:\n\n- The three early return blocks are conditional (if (tool_params.tiny), if (tool_params.medium), if (tool_params.large)) and each return is only executed when the corresponding runtime flag is true. These are not unconditional dead code: different runtime configurations allow different execution paths, so the returns are reachable.\n- The assignment tool_params.empty = ! 0; is reached when none of the three prior conditions hold; therefore it is not unreachable.\n- The final return using the conditional operator ('-' == param_name[1] ? ... : ...) is reachable whenever execution reaches that point. Both outcomes of the ternary operator are reachable depending on the value of param_name[1].\n- There are no statements following an unconditional return that would be statically unreachable, no infinite loops, and no code eliminated by preprocessor directives in the provided fragment.\n\nNotes (not related to reachability): accessing param_name[1] assumes the string has at least two characters; that could be a potential undefined-behavior issue but it does not constitute unreachable code and thus is outside the scope of Rule 2.1 investigation."
