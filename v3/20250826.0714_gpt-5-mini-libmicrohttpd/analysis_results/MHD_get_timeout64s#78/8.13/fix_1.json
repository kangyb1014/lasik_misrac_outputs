  "explanation": "I made the code self-contained and compilable by: 1) adding necessary includes (stdint.h, stdio.h, limits.h); 2) forward-declaring struct MHD_Daemon and declaring the external function int MHD_get_timeout64(...) so we don't define any mock function; 3) providing a constant MHD_NO as a static const int (no macros); 4) adjusted the overflow comparison to utimeout > (uint64_t)INT64_MAX to avoid signed/unsigned warnings while preserving the original logic. The function body and behavior remain the same."
