  "suspicious_frags": [
    "_MHD_EXTERN int64_t\nMHD_get_timeout64s (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)"
  ],
  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation because they appear to use standard C language and library features: int64_t and uint64_t are standard fixed-width integer types from <stdint.h>; INT64_MAX is the standard macro from <stdint.h>/<limits.h>; the cast (int64_t) and the arithmetic/comparison are standard C; MHD_NO and MHD_get_timeout64 are ordinary identifiers from the surrounding API (not language extensions). There are no obvious GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions (for example __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, inline asm, or other compiler-specific keywords) elsewhere in the snippet. The only potentially compiler-specific token is the leading macro _MHD_EXTERN (it may expand to a compiler-specific storage-class or attribute), so it should be investigated to confirm it does not resolve to a documented compiler extension."
