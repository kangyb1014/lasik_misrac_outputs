Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &utimeout))\n    return -1;",

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the local declaration \"uint64_t utimeout;\" is used by the calls and returns; the final \"return (int64_t) utimeout;\" is the normal fall-through return path when MHD_get_timeout64 succeeds and utimeout <= INT64_MAX, so it is reachable and not dead; the function signature and brace structure are required. Unreachable-code issues (code that can never be executed) are distinct from dead code per the rule, and no such unreachable constructs appear here beyond the conditional branches listed above which may be semantically redundant depending on the behavior of MHD_get_timeout64 and the allowed range of utimeout; those branches are therefore the relevant fragments to investigate."
