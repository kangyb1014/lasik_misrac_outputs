  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_timeout64s:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int64_t\nMHD_get_timeout64s (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  uint64_t utimeout;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &utimeout))\n    return -1;\n  if (INT64_MAX < utimeout)\n    return INT64_MAX;\n\n  return (int64_t) utimeout;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (INT64_MAX < utimeout)\n    return INT64_MAX;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "If MHD_get_timeout64 returns a timeout value greater than INT64_MAX (for example utimeout == INT64_MAX + 100), the if-test is reached and causes the function to return INT64_MAX. Removing the test would change behavior (casting that large uint64_t to int64_t would produce an implementation-defined/incorrect result), so the check is necessary and not dead code."
