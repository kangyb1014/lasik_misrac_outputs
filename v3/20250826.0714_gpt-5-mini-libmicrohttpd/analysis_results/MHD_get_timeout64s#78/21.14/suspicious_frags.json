  "explanation": "I found no use of the C standard library function memcmp in the provided code. The function only declares integer variables (uint64_t, int64_t), calls MHD_get_timeout64 (an external function) and performs numeric comparisons and casts (comparing utimeout to INT64_MAX and returning integer values). There are no string operations or null\u2011terminated string comparisons in this fragment. Therefore, there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is called inside MHD_get_timeout64, that would be outside the given fragment and should be inspected separately.)"
