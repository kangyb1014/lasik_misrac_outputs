  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return (int64_t) utimeout;",
    "if (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &utimeout))\n    return -1;",

  ],
  "explanation": "Everything else in the function (the function signature, the declaration 'uint64_t utimeout;', and the braces) are syntactically required and contain no additional conditional or sequential statements that could be statically identified as unreachable. There are no statements following an unconditional return in the same block (no dead fall-through code); each of the flagged fragments represents a distinct control-flow outcome that depends on external state (the result and output of MHD_get_timeout64 and the runtime value of utimeout). Therefore only the listed conditional branches and the final return need investigation for possible unreachable behavior (e.g. if MHD_get_timeout64 can never return MHD_NO, or utimeout can never exceed INT64_MAX, or if certain paths are impossible given the implementation of MHD_get_timeout64). No other code in this function appears to be unreachable."
