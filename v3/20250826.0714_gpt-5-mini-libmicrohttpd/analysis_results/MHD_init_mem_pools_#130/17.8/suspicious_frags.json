  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in MHD_init_mem_pools_(void) \u2014 the function takes void, so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated here. All assignments are to a local variable (result) or a global variable (MHD_sys_page_size_), not to any parameter. The call GetSystemInfo(&si) passes the address of a local variable to an external API; this does not modify any parameter of MHD_init_mem_pools_. The sysconf call returns a value assigned to a local, and the subsequent casts/assignments modify globals, not function parameters. Preprocessor conditionals do not introduce or modify parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
