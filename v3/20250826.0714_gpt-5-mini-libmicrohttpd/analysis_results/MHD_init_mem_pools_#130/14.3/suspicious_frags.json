  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant and thus none require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\nReasons by control point:\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef MHD_SC_PAGESIZE / #elif defined(_WIN32) / #else): these are preprocessor constructs, not C runtime controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3.\n- if (-1 != result): 'result' is assigned from sysconf(MHD_SC_PAGESIZE), so the controlling expression is data-dependent at runtime and not invariant. If sysconf is unavailable, the code falls through to other branches at compile-time, but the runtime if itself is not an invariant constant expression.\n- The #elif defined(_WIN32) branch contains no C runtime conditional expressions; GetSystemInfo and the assignment to MHD_sys_page_size_ produce runtime-dependent values.\n- mhd_assert (0 == (MHD_sys_page_size_ % ALIGN_SIZE)): the expression depends on MHD_sys_page_size_, which is set at runtime above, so it is not an invariant controlling expression. (Also, asserts are not loop/selection controlling expressions in the function source; their internal implementation is outside this snippet.)\n\nNo infinite loops or do-while constant-false patterns (the exceptions to Rule 14.3) are present, so no fragments in this function should be flagged for investigation under Rule 14.3."
