  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- Preprocessor usage (#ifdef, #elif, #endif) is standard C preprocessor behavior.\n- Casts like (size_t) and use of standard types (long, size_t) are standard C.\n- Calls to platform APIs (sysconf, GetSystemInfo) and use of platform types (SYSTEM_INFO) are OS/library APIs, not language extensions.\n- The mhd_assert and MHD_* identifiers are project macros/identifiers; their presence here does not itself indicate a language/compiler extension.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
