  "explanation": "I examined the entire function; there are no calls to memcmp (nor any other string-comparison functions) in this code fragment. The function only calls sysconf/GetSystemInfo, assigns values, casts to size_t, and performs an integer modulo assertion. None of these operations involve comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp, so there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
