  "scenario": "The call to sysconf(MHD_SC_PAGESIZE) is a call to a POSIX system/library function and, as shown, does not call MHD_init_mem_pools_ either directly or indirectly. Therefore there is no recursion. (Only a contrived violation would occur if sysconf had been redefined/overridden in this translation unit to call MHD_init_mem_pools_, which is not the case here.)"
