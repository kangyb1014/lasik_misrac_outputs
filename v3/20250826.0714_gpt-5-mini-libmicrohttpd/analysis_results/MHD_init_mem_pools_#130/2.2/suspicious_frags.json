  "explanation": "The remaining code lines are core, exercised operations that affect program behaviour and thus are not candidates for dead code: the sysconf call and its result check, the assignments to MHD_sys_page_size_ that store the detected page size, and the GetSystemInfo call on Windows all have observable side effects and would change program behaviour if removed. The function signature and surrounding braces are structural and required. The suspicious fragments reported are the conditional compilation branches and duplicate/default assignment and the assertion line \u2014 these should be investigated because they may be compiled but never exercised or may have no effect in some builds/configurations. Other fragments do not qualify as dead code because their removal would alter behaviour (they perform system calls, set global state, or are needed for correct control flow)."
