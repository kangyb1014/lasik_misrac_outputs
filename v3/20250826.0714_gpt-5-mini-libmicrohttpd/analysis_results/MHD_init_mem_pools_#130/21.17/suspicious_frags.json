  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns the use of string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided function MHD_init_mem_pools_ contains no calls to any of these functions or any other <string.h> APIs.\n\nLine-by-line rationale:\n- The sysconf(MHD_SC_PAGESIZE) call and its handling do not invoke any string functions; they obtain a system page size (long) and cast to size_t.\n- The GetSystemInfo(&si) call on Windows is an OS API and does not involve string.h functions; assigning si.dwPageSize to MHD_sys_page_size_ is an integer assignment.\n- The fallback assignment to MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_ is a constant integer assignment.\n- The mhd_assert checking alignment uses integer arithmetic and does not call string functions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, and no fragments need to be investigated for out-of-bounds accesses caused by <string.h> functions."
