  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function is provably unreachable. Each conditional (if (0 != tool_params.threads) and if (tool_params.thread_per_conn)) can legitimately evaluate to true or false at runtime, so both the bodies (with fprintf and return) and the subsequent fall-through path are potentially reachable. The final assignment (tool_params.all_cpus = ! 0;) and the return using the ternary expression are reachable when the earlier returns are not taken; both arms of the ternary depend on the runtime contents of param_name[1] and thus are potentially reachable. There are no labels, gotos, or code following an unconditional return that would be dead. Note: possible undefined behavior from dereferencing param_name[1] if param_name is too short is a correctness/robustness concern but does not constitute unreachable code, so it is not reported under Rule 2.1."
