  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any function from <string.h>, so it does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, if param_name does not point to a valid NUL-terminated string (for example, it points to a non-terminated buffer or to memory that ends before a '\\0'), then the %s conversion in fprintf will read bytes until a NUL is found and may access beyond the bounds of the object \u2014 which would be an out-of-bounds string access (the kind of problem Rule 21.17 aims to prevent). Ensure param_name is a valid NUL-terminated string to avoid this issue."
