  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) are invoked elsewhere in this function. The remaining statements perform simple integer/boolean checks and assignments (the two if checks, the assignment to tool_params.all_cpus and the enum returns) and do not perform pointer-based string operations relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so they do not need investigation under this rule."
