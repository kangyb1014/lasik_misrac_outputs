  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__all_cpus:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__all_cpus (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (0 != tool_params.threads)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-t' or '--threads'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-P' or '--thread-per-conn'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.all_cpus = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.all_cpus = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment tool_params.all_cpus = !0 sets a flag (logical NOT of 0 is 1) that affects program behaviour later; removing it would change the program state and likely behaviour, so this is not dead code. (If, however, tool_params.all_cpus were never read anywhere in the project, then that assignment would be dead code.)"
