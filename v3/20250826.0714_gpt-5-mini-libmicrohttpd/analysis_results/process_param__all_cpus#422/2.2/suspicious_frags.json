Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The fragments selected cover all operations in this function that could plausibly be \"dead\" (executed but removable without changing program behaviour): the two conditional branches (including their fprintf/return), the assignment to tool_params.all_cpus, and the final return expression. Other parts of the function (the function signature, parameter declaration, braces and overall control flow) are structural and cannot be removed without changing behaviour, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 2.2 within this snippet. The selected fragments should be investigated to determine whether the assignment or branches have any observable effect elsewhere in the project (e.g. whether tool_params.all_cpus is ever read, or whether the conditional branches can actually be taken)."
