  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameters themselves. The function parameters are:\n- connection (type: struct MHD_Connection *): only members of the pointed-to object are modified (connection->stop_with_error and connection->discard_request). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; only changing the pointer variable (e.g. assigning to connection) would violate the rule. There is no assignment to the pointer variable.\n- emsg (type: const char *): it is only tested against NULL, passed to MHD_DLOG, and explicitly cast to void to silence a warning. None of these actions modify the pointer variable or the pointee. Also, passing the pointer to another function does not count as modifying the parameter within this function.\n- The call to MHD_connection_close_(connection, ...) passes the pointer but does not reassign the parameter inside this function. Any effects inside the called function do not constitute modification of this function's parameter variable.\nTherefore, there are no fragments in this code that warrant investigation for a Rule 17.8 violation."
