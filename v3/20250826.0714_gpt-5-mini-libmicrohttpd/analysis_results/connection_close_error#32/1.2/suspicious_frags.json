  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code contains only standard C constructs: a static function, pointer to a struct parameter, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#else/#endif), a cast to void to silence an unused-parameter warning, assignment to structure members, and a function call. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, asm labels, trailing commas in expressions, or other vendor-specific tokens typically documented as extensions. The macro MHD_DLOG may expand to logging code (possibly a variadic macro), but variadic macros are part of standard C (since C99) and a macro expansion itself is not a language extension unless it uses extension-specific constructs \u2014 none are visible here. The use of true/false likely comes from stdbool.h or project-defined macros; that is not inherently a compiler language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
