  "explanation": "The remaining statements in the function are simple, clearly reachable operations and therefore do not require investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the two assignments to connection->stop_with_error and connection->discard_request are unconditional and executed on every call; the final call to MHD_connection_close_ is executed unconditionally after the preprocessor/conditional block. There are no statements after MHD_connection_close_ in this function that could be unreachable, and the function signature and parameter use do not, by themselves, indicate unreachable code. The only regions that warrant checking for potential unreachable-code issues are the conditional compilation and the run-time conditional that I listed above."
