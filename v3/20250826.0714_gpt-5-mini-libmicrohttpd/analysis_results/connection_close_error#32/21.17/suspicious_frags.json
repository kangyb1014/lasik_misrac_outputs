  "explanation": "No direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The only place a string object is accessed is when emsg is passed to MHD_DLOG inside the conditional (and emsg is tested for NULL before that), and the \u2018\u2018(void) emsg;\u2019\u2019 line simply silences a compiler warning. Because the implementation of MHD_DLOG (a macro/function) is not present in this fragment, it might internally call string-handling routines (for example to format/measure the \"%s\" argument) which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses if emsg is not a valid NUL-terminated string. Therefore the MHD_DLOG usage (the if (NULL != emsg) ... MHD_DLOG(...) block) should be investigated. All other statements in the function do not invoke string.h functions and do not perform string accesses, so they do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
