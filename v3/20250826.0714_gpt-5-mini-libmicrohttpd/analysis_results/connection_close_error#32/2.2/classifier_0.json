  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_close_error:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_close_error (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                        const char *emsg)\n{\n  connection->stop_with_error = true;\n  connection->discard_request = true;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (NULL != emsg)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              \"%s\\n\",\n              emsg);\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Based on the provided fragment alone we cannot prove the assignment is dead. The statement connection->stop_with_error = true; is not provably dead because other code (including MHD_connection_close_ or other connection-handling paths) may read that flag and change behaviour. A concrete violation scenario would be: if a full project inspection shows that the field stop_with_error is never read anywhere (neither in MHD_connection_close_ nor elsewhere), then removing this assignment would not affect program behaviour and it would be dead code (Rule 2.2 violated)."
