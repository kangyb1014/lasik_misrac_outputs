  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_close_error:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_close_error (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                        const char *emsg)\n{\n  connection->stop_with_error = true;\n  connection->discard_request = true;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (NULL != emsg)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              \"%s\\n\",\n              emsg);\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The expression-statement \u201c(void) emsg;\u201d is executed but has no effect on program behaviour (it only suppresses an unused-parameter warning). Removing that statement does not change runtime behaviour for a normal const char * parameter, so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. (Only if evaluating the parameter had observable side-effects \u2014 e.g. emsg were volatile or its evaluation triggered a side-effect \u2014 would this not be dead code.)"
