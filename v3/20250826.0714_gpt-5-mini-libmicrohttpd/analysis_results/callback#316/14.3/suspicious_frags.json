  "explanation": "Only actual controlling expressions in the compiled code need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two if-statements above are the only controlling constructs in this function and therefore must be checked to ensure their controlling expressions are not invariant. The pseudo-code if-blocks in the comments are not compiled and thus are not subject to MISRA enforcement here. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in the function that would create additional controlling expressions to review. Other statements (memcpy, return cast, local variable declarations and comments) are not controlling expressions and do not pertain to Rule 14.3, so they do not require investigation under this rule."
