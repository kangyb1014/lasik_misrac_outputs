  "explanation": "I selected the code fragments above for further investigation. They represent explicit early-return handling and commented-out alternative return paths (pseudo-code) and a commented-out assertion; each could indicate behavior or code paths that may be redundant, disabled, or inconsistent with what actually executes at runtime and therefore merit review for possible dead-code issues.\n\nWhy other fragments do not require investigation for MISRA Rule 2.2 in this function:\n- The parameter declaration and cast (struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param = (struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *) cls;) is required to interpret the callback context and is not removable without changing behaviour.\n- The buf_size vs remaining-size calculation (if (buf_size < (param->response_size - pos)) ... else ...) determines how much data is copied; removing it would alter behavior, so it is not dead code.\n- The memcpy(buf, param->response_data + pos, size_to_copy); actually moves data to the provided buffer and is clearly behaviorally necessary.\n- The final return of the number of bytes copied (return (ssize_t) size_to_copy;) is the primary output of the function; removing it would change program behaviour.\n- General explanatory comments (notes about pos, casting to ssize_t, etc.) and the header/footing comments are not executable code and therefore not subject to Rule 2.2.\n\nThe selected fragments should be inspected to confirm whether any of the early-return branches are redundant, disabled, or otherwise constitute dead code in the broader project context (for example, if a branch can never be taken in all configurations, or if code paths are commented-out leaving behind executed no-ops elsewhere)."
