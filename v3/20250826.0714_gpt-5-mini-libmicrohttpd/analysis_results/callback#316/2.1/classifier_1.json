  "scenario": "No \u2014 as written the final return is reachable. A specific violation scenario would be if an earlier return is made unconditional (for example if the condition becomes always true). For example, if param->response_size is known to be 0 for all calls (statically or by program logic) and the caller always invokes the callback with pos == 0, then the earlier branch if (pos >= param->response_size) would always take the MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM return and the final return ((ssize_t) size_to_copy) would be unreachable. In the current code, however, the earlier returns are conditional, so the final return is reachable."
