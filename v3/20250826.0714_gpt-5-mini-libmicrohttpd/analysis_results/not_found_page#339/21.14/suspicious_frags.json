  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings (MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14). No occurrence of memcmp is present. The code only uses strlen on NOT_FOUND_ERROR (to obtain the length of a null-terminated string literal) and passes const char * values to MHD API functions; there are no explicit string comparisons using memcmp or analogous byte-wise comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need further investigation for Rule 21.14."
