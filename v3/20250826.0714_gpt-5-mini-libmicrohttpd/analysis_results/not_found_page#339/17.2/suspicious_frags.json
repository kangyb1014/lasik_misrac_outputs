  "explanation": "No direct recursive call to not_found_page is present in the function body (the function never calls not_found_page). There are also no function-pointer invocations, no assignments of function pointers, and no data structures or callbacks passed in from this function that obviously contain references to not_found_page. The only places that could possibly lead to indirect recursion are calls into external/library functions; those specific call sites are listed above for investigation. All remaining fragments (variable declarations, (void) casts for unused parameters, return statements, and simple enum/struct usage) do not indicate direct or indirect self-calling behavior and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2."
