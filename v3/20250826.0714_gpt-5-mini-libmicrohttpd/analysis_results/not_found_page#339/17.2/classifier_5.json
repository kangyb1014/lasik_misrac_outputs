  "scenario": "The call MHD_destroy_response(response) is a call to an external/library function from not_found_page. There is no evidence that not_found_page calls itself directly or that MHD_destroy_response (or any other called function) calls back into not_found_page, so no direct or indirect recursion is present. (Only if MHD_destroy_response were implemented to call not_found_page would Rule 17.2 be violated, but that is not indicated here.)"
