  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of not_found_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nnot_found_page (const void *cls,\n                const char *mime,\n                struct Session *session,\n                struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  (void) cls;     /* Unused.
