  "explanation": "The three fragments above are ones that should be investigated for possible unreachable code (first two are early-return conditions; the third is a two-way branch whose one side might never be taken in the project). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: the local declarations (void *ret; size_t asize;) and the asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(size); assignment are simple computations/initialisations and are not inherently unreachable. The mhd_assert(...) lines are diagnostic checks (macros that may be compiled out) and do not represent unreachable code by themselves. The final call to _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(ret, size); and the terminal return ret; are reachable whenever an allocation succeeds and thus do not present unreachable-code concerns. No other code fragments in this function appear to be statically unreachable."
