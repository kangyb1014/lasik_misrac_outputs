  "explanation": "No iteration statements (for, while, do-while) appear in the provided function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions of iteration statements; the code only contains selection statements (if/else) whose controlling expressions (asize comparisons and the parameter from_end) are computed at runtime and are not invariant. The assert and macro calls (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) are invocations whose expansions are not shown in this fragment; without their expansions there are no visible loop controlling expressions to inspect. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments in this function related to Rule 14.3."
