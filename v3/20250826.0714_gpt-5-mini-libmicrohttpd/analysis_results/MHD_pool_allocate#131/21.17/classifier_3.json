  "scenario": "The statement pool->end -= asize; itself does not call any <string.h> routine and therefore does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The function performs checks (asize computed, asize > pool->end - pool->pos guarded) that prevent reducing pool->end past pool->pos. A violation of Rule 21.17 could occur later if the returned pointer (ret) is passed to a string.h function with a length larger than the allocated region. Example concrete violation: if asize == 0 (size == 0) and pool->end == pool->size, ret becomes &pool->memory[pool->end] (one-past-end). If client code then incorrectly calls memcpy(ret, src, 1) or strcpy(ret, src) the string.h function would access beyond the bounds \u2014 that would violate Rule 21.17."
