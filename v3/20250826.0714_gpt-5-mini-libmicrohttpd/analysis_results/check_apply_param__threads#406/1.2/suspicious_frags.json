  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition, static storage class, if statements, function calls, and standard library I/O functions (printf/fprintf). There are no occurrences of common compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, __asm / inline assembly, typeof / __typeof__, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions, asm goto, transparent unions, zero-length arrays, or other documented GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions. The identifier check_apply_param__threads contains a double underscore, which is a reserved identifier by the C standard but is not itself a compiler language extension and therefore is not reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as described in the task. Consequently, no fragments need to be investigated for use of language extensions."
