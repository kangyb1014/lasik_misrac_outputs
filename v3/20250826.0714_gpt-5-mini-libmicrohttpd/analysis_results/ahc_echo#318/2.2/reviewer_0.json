  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. The cast-to-void statements such as (void)upload_data; are a deliberate idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. They are effect\u2011free at runtime (no side effects) but are not the kind of unintended, removable operations that Rule 2.2 targets. Rule 2.2 is intended to prevent operations that are executed yet serve no purpose for the program\u2019s behaviour; the void\u2011cast idiom is a documented, intentional annotation of an unused parameter and is commonly accepted as not constituting \u201cdead code\u201d in MISRA guidance. If you want to avoid these annotations you can use an approved project-wide mechanism (macro or attribute) to indicate unused parameters, but the presence of (void)upload_data; in this handler is not a violation of Rule 2.2."
