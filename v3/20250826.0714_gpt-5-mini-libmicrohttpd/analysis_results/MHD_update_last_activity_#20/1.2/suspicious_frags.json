  "explanation": "I inspected the function body for compiler-specific language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (examples: __attribute__ / __declspec / __asm / __builtin_* / typeof (GCC) / statement-expressions ({ ... }) / nested functions (GCC) / labels-as-values / __extension__ / __thread (compiler-specific) / inline assembly / nonstandard pragmas). The code contains only standard C constructs: preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)), function definition, structure member access, function/macro calls (MHD_monotonic_msec_counter(), XDLL_remove/insert, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ etc.), and C-style comments. None of the identifiers or macros used (including names ending with underscores) are themselves evidence of compiler language extensions. Conditional compilation for thread support and use of macros is standard practice and not a language extension by itself. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that use compiler language extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
