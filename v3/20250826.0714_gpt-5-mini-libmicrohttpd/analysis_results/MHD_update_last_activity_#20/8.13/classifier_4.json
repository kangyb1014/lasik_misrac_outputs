  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Based on the single fragment, there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 violation. The statement only compares the pointer to NULL (read-only use) and does not show the pointer's declaration. Rule 8.13 concerns the pointer's declaration (it should point to a const-qualified type where possible). Without the declaration of daemon->worker_pool you cannot conclude a violation. If, however, daemon->worker_pool is declared as a non-const pointer but the pointee is never modified anywhere, then the declaration would violate Rule 8.13 (i.e. it could/should be declared as pointing to const)."
