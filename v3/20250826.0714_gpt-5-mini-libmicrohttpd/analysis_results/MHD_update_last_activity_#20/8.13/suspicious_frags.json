  "explanation": "I selected code fragments that involve pointer declarations or pointer arguments passed around (function parameter, local pointer assignment, access to daemon members, and calls that take pointer/address arguments). These are the places that should be inspected to determine whether the pointed-to types could or should be const-qualified under MISRA C Rule 8.13.\n\nOther fragments were not selected because they clearly require a mutable target or are not pointer declarations/uses that can be made const: for example, the assignment \"connection->last_activity = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\" modifies the object pointed to by 'connection' (so 'connection' cannot be const-qualified for this function), the tests \"if (0 == connection->connection_timeout_ms)\" and \"if (connection->suspended)\" are simple reads but occur in a function that modifies the connection and interacts with list-management functions (so the parameter cannot be assumed const without further context), and the preprocessor guards, return statements and comments contain no pointer type that could be const-qualified. Lock/unlock calls were included in the suspicious list because they take addresses of daemon members; any other non-pointer-only statements were omitted as not relevant to Rule 8.13."
