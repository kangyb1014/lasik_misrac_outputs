  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not flagged because they have clear observable effects on program behaviour or are necessary control flow checks: - The local declaration and retrieval of daemon from connection is used later. - The early returns for connection_timeout_ms == 0 and connection->suspended prevent further actions and therefore affect behaviour. - The assignment connection->last_activity = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter() clearly changes program state used for timeouts. - The surrounding preprocessor conditionals themselves are compile-time controls (not runtime dead code) and so are not by themselves violations. The flagged fragments above are selected because they are operations whose presence may be redundant or no-op in some builds/configurations (asserts that may be compiled out, redundant/duplicate timeout/thread checks, unconditional remove+insert list operations, and mutex calls that may be empty macros) and therefore merit investigation for potential dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
