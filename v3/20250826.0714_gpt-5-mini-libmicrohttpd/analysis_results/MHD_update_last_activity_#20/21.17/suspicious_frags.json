  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string-handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) occur in the provided function body. The operations present are: assignments (connection->last_activity = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter()), conditional checks and returns, mutex lock/unlock calls, and invocations of XDLL_remove / XDLL_insert. None of these are string.h functions or obvious buffer-copy/scan operations that could access beyond object bounds. The mutex and daemon/connection pointer accesses do not involve string buffer manipulation. Although XDLL_remove/XDLL_insert are macros/functions invoked here, their names and use indicate linked-list operations; there is no evidence in this fragment that they call any string.h routines. Given only the supplied code, there are no suspect uses of string.h functions to report for further investigation."
