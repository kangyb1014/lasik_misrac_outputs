  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code: the controlling expression depends on the runtime field connection->daemon->client_discipline and therefore is not invariant. A specific violation scenario would be if client_discipline were an integral constant expression (for example replaced by a macro or a compile-time constant so the condition is always true or always false); in that case the if would be invariant and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (no applicable exception here)."
