  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp are present in the provided code. There are no code sequences that perform comparisons of null-terminated strings (e.g. memcmp(fdstrings,...), memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(...)), or similar). The only string literal usage is inside the MHD_DLOG(...) call (a format/translation macro), which is not a string comparison. The conditional and integer comparisons (e.g. FD_SETSIZE vs daemon->fdset_size, checks of millisec, daemon->shutdown) are not string comparisons and thus not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: other functions called here (MHD_poll_all, MHD_epoll, MHD_select, MHD_cleanup_connections, etc.) are external to this snippet; any memcmp usage inside those functions is not visible in the provided code and would need to be inspected in their own definitions."
