  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_add_header:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nconnection_add_header (void *cls,\n                       const char *key,\n                       size_t key_size,\n                       const char *value,\n                       size_t value_size,\n                       enum MHD_ValueKind kind)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *connection = (struct MHD_Connection *) cls;\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_set_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                  kind,\n                                  key,\n                                  key_size,\n                                  value,\n                                  value_size))\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in pool to allocate header record!\\n\"));\n#endif\n    transmit_error_response_static (connection,\n                                    MHD_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE,\n                                    ERR_MSG_REQUEST_TOO_BIG);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in pool to allocate header record!\\n\"));\n#endif\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code fragment is a conditional logging call inside #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES. When HAVE_MESSAGES is defined the MHD_DLOG call produces an observable effect (log output and timing), so removing it would change program behaviour \u2014 it is not dead code. If HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined the fragment is excluded by the preprocessor and thus not present in the compiled project. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
