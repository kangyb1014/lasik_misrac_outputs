  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. The only conditional in the function is\n\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_set_connection_value_n(...))\n\nwhich calls the function MHD_set_connection_value_n and thus is not an invariant constant expression. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements whose controlling expressions are constant. Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) are compile-time directives, not runtime controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. The literal uses of MHD_NO and MHD_YES are return values/constants, not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
