  "explanation": "The rest of the code consists of the function signature, a local pointer cast, conditional/return statements, and constant/macro identifiers. None of those by themselves can introduce direct or indirect self-calls; they are not function invocations that could form a recursion cycle. The four fragments above are the only function calls (including the nested translation call) present in this snippet and therefore are the only places that could potentially call back into connection_add_header (directly or indirectly) and must be investigated for Rule 17.2 compliance."
