  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified. Each return statement in the function is conditional (guarding response, header_len, or content_len), and subsequent checks (memchr calls) are reachable only when the preceding length checks pass. There are no constant-conditional branches, no code placed after unconditional returns, and no obviously dead branches that can never execute. The final call to MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ is reachable whenever none of the prior guards return false. \n\nNote: although there are potential safety/undefined-behavior concerns (e.g., memchr invoked with header or content == NULL when their corresponding lengths are non-zero), those are not instances of unreachable code and thus are not reported here. Such issues should be investigated under other MISRA rules (pointer validity/null-checking and undefined behavior), but they do not indicate violations of Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
