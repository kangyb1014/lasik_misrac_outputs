  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function that appears to be an input-only handle and thus a candidate for const-qualification is the 'daemon' parameter; it is not modified in this function and is passed to MHD_get_timeout64 (so the callee prototype should be checked to see whether it could accept a pointer-to-const). The 'timeout' parameter is written to (output parameter), so it must remain a non-const pointer and should not be made const. The local variable 'uint64_t t64' is passed by address to MHD_get_timeout64 and is used as an output from that call, so that pointer use cannot be const-qualified. No other pointer declarations/usages exist in this fragment that would sensibly be made const."
