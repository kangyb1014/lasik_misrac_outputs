  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No language-extension token is present in the fragment. _MHD_EXTERN is just an identifier (likely a macro) and, as shown, does not itself constitute a compiler language extension. There is no explicit use of known compiler extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, asm, inline asm, or other compiler-specific keywords) in the fragment. Therefore Rule 1.2 is not violated. (If the macro _MHD_EXTERN expands elsewhere to a compiler-specific extension such as __attribute__ or __declspec, that expansion would violate Rule 1.2 \u2014 but that is not visible in the provided code fragment.)"
