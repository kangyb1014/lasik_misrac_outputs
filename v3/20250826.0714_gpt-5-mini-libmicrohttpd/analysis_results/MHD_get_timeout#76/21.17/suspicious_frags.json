  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in this function. The code only performs integer operations, a call to MHD_get_timeout64, and an assignment through the timeout pointer; none of these are string.h calls that could access beyond object bounds under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If callers/callees (for example MHD_get_timeout64) use string.h functions, those functions should be inspected separately, but within the shown MHD_get_timeout implementation there are no string-handling invocations to investigate."
