  "explanation": "I inspected all parameter usage in MHD_get_timeout: the function parameters are 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' and 'MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG *timeout'. There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves (no statements like 'daemon = ...' or 'timeout = ...', no increments/decrements of those parameter identifiers). The code does assign to '*timeout' which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer \u2014 this is explicitly allowed by the rule. Passing 'daemon' and '&t64' to MHD_get_timeout64 does not modify the pointer parameters themselves. 't64' is a local variable. The preprocessor conditional and comparisons do not change any parameter variable. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
