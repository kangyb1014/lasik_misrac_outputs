  "explanation": "The provided function MHD_get_timeout contains no calls to memcmp and performs only integer handling (uint64_t, ULLONG_MAX, casting, and a call to MHD_get_timeout64). There are no char* or string literals, no string-manipulation functions (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.), and no comparisons of null-terminated strings in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
