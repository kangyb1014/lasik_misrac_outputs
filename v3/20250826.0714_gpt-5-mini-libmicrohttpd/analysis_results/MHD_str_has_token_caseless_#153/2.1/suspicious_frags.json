  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be unreachable. Rationale: \n- The function entry and the early check (if (0 == token_len) return false;) are clearly reachable when token_len is zero. \n- The outer loop (while (0 != *str)) is controlled by the runtime value pointed to by str and can terminate normally when the NUL terminator is reached, so code after the loop (return false;) is reachable. \n- The inner infinite loop (while (1)) contains explicit and reachable exit points: a return false when the current character sc is NUL, a break on character mismatch, and a return true when a full token match is found. Each break falls through to the subsequent \"Find next substring\" loop, which is reachable. \n- All pointer dereferences are guarded by checks that either test *str for NUL before use or return immediately when sc == 0, avoiding implicit unreachable code due to dereferencing NUL. \n- There are no statements following an unconditional infinite loop with no exits, nor any unreachable labels or dead code blocks. \nGiven these control-flow paths, there is no evidence of unreachable code in the provided function; therefore no fragments need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
