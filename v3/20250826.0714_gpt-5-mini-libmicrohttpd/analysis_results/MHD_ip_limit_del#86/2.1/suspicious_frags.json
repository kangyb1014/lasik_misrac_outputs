  "explanation": "These are the only fragments that warrant investigation for unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1 because they contain calls to MHD_PANIC. If MHD_PANIC is implemented as a non-returning routine (e.g. it aborts, longjmps, or otherwise does not return), then code that follows the call in the same control flow path becomes statically unreachable. The flagged items include the two MHD_PANIC call sites and the statement immediately following the first panic (the found_key assignment), which would be unreachable if the panic does not return.\n\nAll other code paths and statements in the function appear reachable based on the source shown: the early returns (checks of daemon->per_ip_connection_limit and MHD_ip_addr_to_key) are conditional and intentionally transfer control; calls such as tfind, tdelete, MHD_ip_count_lock/unlock, and free are ordinary calls expected to return, so code after them is not inherently unreachable. The decrement-and-else logic for found_key->count is conditional and reachable in either branch, so it does not present an obvious unreachable-code concern from the source alone."
