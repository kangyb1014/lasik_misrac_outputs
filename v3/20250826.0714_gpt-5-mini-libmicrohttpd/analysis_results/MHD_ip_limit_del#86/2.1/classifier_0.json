  "scenario": "The if-statement is reachable when found_key->count == 0 (e.g., due to a logic or concurrency fault). The call to MHD_PANIC presumably aborts/terminates in that error case but that does not make this branch itself unreachable. Therefore this fragment does not contain unreachable code. (Note: if an analyzer treats MHD_PANIC as a non-returning macro, code following an unconditional MHD_PANIC call could be considered unreachable, but that is not the situation here.)"
