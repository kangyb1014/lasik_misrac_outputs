  "scenario": "No violation: tdelete\u2019s prototype accepts a const-qualified key (const void *) and a comparator taking const void * arguments. Passing found_key (struct MHD_IPCount *) is implicitly converted to const void * and &daemon->per_ip_connection_count matches the expected root pointer type, so there is no failure to use const where possible. (A violation would occur if the comparator or tdelete prototype used non-const pointer parameters but could have been const.)"
