  "explanation": "No direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp or similar string-comparison functions) appears anywhere in this function. The remaining lines in the function are integer/pointer checks, locking/unlocking, memory management (free), and error reporting; none of those operations themselves use memcmp or perform null-terminated string comparisons, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.14. The listed fragments are the only points in this function that invoke other functions which could internally perform comparisons of data (and thus potentially call memcmp on null-terminated strings); therefore they are the ones selected for further inspection."
