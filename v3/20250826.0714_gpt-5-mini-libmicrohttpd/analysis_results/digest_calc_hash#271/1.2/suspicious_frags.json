  "explanation": "I inspected the code for tokens or constructs that are known compiler/language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __inline__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __declspec, GCC statement-expressions, MSVC-specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions). None of those appear directly in the visible source. The remaining items are standard C constructs or macros whose definitions are not shown here: - Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #endif) and macro names (MHD_MD5_SUPPORT, MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT, _DEBUG, etc.) are standard preprocessor usage. Whether those macros map to compiler-specific behavior depends on their definitions, which are not present in this fragment. - Use of standard fixed-width integer type uint8_t and boolean literals true/false are C-standard (stdint.h and stdbool.h). - mhd_assert and functions like MHD_MD5_finish, MHD_SHA256_finish, etc., are macro/function calls; their implementations are not shown, so there is no direct evidence in this fragment that they use compiler extensions. - The control flow (if/else), assignments, and comments are standard C. The only token that looks like it may expand to a compiler-specific storage-class/inline specifier is the leading identifier _MHD_static_inline on the function declaration; that macro likely maps to an inline/static/extension form (for example it might expand to __inline, __inline__, or use attributes) and thus should be investigated to confirm it does not rely on a compiler extension. No other explicit language-extension constructs were found in the provided code fragment."
