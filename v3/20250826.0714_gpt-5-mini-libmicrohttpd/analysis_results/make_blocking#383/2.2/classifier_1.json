  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of make_blocking:\n```c\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. In the MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS branch the variable 'flags' is passed by address to ioctlsocket and the ioctlsocket call (and the subsequent abort() on failure) have observable side\u2011effects on program behaviour (they change socket blocking mode or terminate the program). Removing the declaration/initialization or the call would change behaviour, so this is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
