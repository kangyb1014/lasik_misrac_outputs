  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The code contains only conditional if statements whose controlling expressions depend on runtime-returned values or variables:\n- flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL); then if (-1 == flags) \u2014 'flags' is a runtime value returned by fcntl, not a compile-time constant.\n- if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags) \u2014 uses the runtime value 'flags'.\n- if (-1 == fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK)) \u2014 result of fcntl is runtime-dependent.\n- for Winsock: if (0 != ioctlsocket(fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags)) \u2014 ioctlsocket return value is runtime-dependent.\nThere are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) with constant controlling expressions; the preprocessor #if/#elif directives are compile-time configuration, not C controlling expressions covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3. Therefore no fragments require investigation under Rule 14.3."
