  "explanation": "I found no code fragment in the provided function that warrants investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (functions shall not call themselves, directly or indirectly). Reasoning by fragment:\n\n- Function header and body: make_blocking is defined as static void and contains only system calls and abort; there is no call to make_blocking itself.\n- POSIX branch: calls fcntl(...) and abort(). These are direct calls to library/system functions, not to make_blocking. There are no function-pointer invocations or callbacks in this fragment that could cause an indirect call back to make_blocking.\n- Windows branch: calls ioctlsocket(...) and abort(). Again, these are system API/library calls and not calls to make_blocking. No function-pointer use or callback mechanism is present.\n- Conditional compilation: the #if/#elif selects one of the two non-recursive branches; no code path invokes make_blocking recursively.\n\nGiven there are no self-calls, no function pointers, no callbacks, and no macro expansions that call make_blocking, there is no direct or indirect recursion to investigate in this function."
