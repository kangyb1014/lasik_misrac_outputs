  "explanation": "I flagged the macro-like/implementation-specific identifiers that may expand to compiler-specific extensions and therefore should be inspected in their definitions. I did not flag the remaining code because it uses standard C constructs: function definition/syntax, enums, pointer and const qualifiers, NULL, string literals, and the return statement are all standard C. There are no obvious uses of known compiler extensions in the shown fragment such as __attribute__, __declspec, GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, inline assembly, or other builtin/underscore-prefixed compiler keywords aside from the listed macros. Inspect the definitions of the flagged macros/typedefs to determine whether they introduce any compiler-specific extensions; if they are plain standard C (e.g., simple extern or standard assert), no further investigation is needed."
