  "explanation": "The remainder of the function consists only of the function declaration/definition, braces and a single return statement that directly forwards to another function; there are no conditional statements, labels, gotos, loops or duplicate/after-return statements in this fragment that could themselves be unreachable. The only elements that could cause unreachable-code concerns in this snippet are the assertion (whose definition may abort or not be present in some builds) and the forwarded call (which includes an explicit NULL argument that may affect code paths in the callee). Therefore no other parts of this function need investigation for Rule 2.1."
