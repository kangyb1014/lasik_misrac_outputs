  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignment statements (e.g., parameter = ...), increments/decrements, or pointer arithmetic applied to any parameter.\n- The mhd_assert(NULL != password); only evaluates the parameter and does not modify it.\n- The return statement merely passes the parameters (and a literal NULL) to digest_auth_check_all; passing parameters to another function does not modify the local parameter variables in this function. (Any modification of the objects pointed to by pointer parameters would occur inside the called function, which is allowed by Rule 17.8.)\n- The pointer parameters (connection, realm, username, password) are not reassigned, and the non-pointer parameters (nonce_timeout, max_nc, mqop, malgo3) are not changed.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that raise a concern under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
