  "explanation": "There is no direct self-call in this function (it does not call MHD_digest_auth_check3), so no direct recursion is present. The primary point requiring investigation is the call to digest_auth_check_all: to check for indirect recursion you must inspect digest_auth_check_all and any functions it calls to ensure they do not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_digest_auth_check3 or create a call cycle. The mhd_assert macro is included as a fragment for completeness, but it is unlikely to introduce recursion; its expansion should be checked only if it is non-trivial (e.g., calls functions that could form a cycle). Other parts of the function (the signature, parameter list, simple pass-through of arguments, and the return statement structure) are ordinary declarations/constructs and do not themselves constitute calls that could create recursion beyond the digest_auth_check_all invocation, so they do not need separate investigation beyond verifying what digest_auth_check_all performs."
