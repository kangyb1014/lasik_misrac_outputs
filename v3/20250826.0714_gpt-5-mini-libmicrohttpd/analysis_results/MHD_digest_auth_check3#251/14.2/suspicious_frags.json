First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "There are no explicit for statements or loop counters in the provided function body or parameter list \u2014 a textual search shows no 'for' tokens, and the function only performs an assert and returns the result of a single helper call. Therefore no other fragments in this snippet can directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. However, the behaviour of a for loop includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement and macros can expand to code containing for loops. For that reason the two fragments above are flagged for investigation: (1) the mhd_assert line \u2014 the macro definition should be inspected to ensure it does not expand into a for loop or otherwise violate the rule; and (2) the call to digest_auth_check_all \u2014 its implementation must be inspected for any for loops and to verify that any for loops there satisfy the three clauses and single-loop-counter constraint of Rule 14.2. No other lines (function signature, parameter declarations, return type, or the surrounding braces) contain or can introduce for loops in this snippet, so they do not need to be investigated here."
