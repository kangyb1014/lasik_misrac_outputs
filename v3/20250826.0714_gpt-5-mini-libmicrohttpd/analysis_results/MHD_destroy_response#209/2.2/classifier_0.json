  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_destroy_response:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN void\nMHD_destroy_response (struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n  if (0 != --(response->reference_count))\n  {\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n    MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n    return;\n  }\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n  MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n  if (NULL != response->crfc)\n    response->crfc (response->crc_cls);\n\n  if (NULL != response->data_iov)\n  {\n    free (response->data_iov);\n  }\n\n  while (NULL != response->first_header)\n  {\n    pos = response->first_header;\n    response->first_header = pos->next;\n    free (pos->header);\n    free (pos->value);\n    free (pos);\n  }\n  free (response);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n    MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The unlock call is executed on the path where response->reference_count becomes zero (the case after the decrement). If thread support macros are defined, the mutex was locked earlier and must be unlocked before destroying it, so removing the unlock would change program behaviour. If thread support macros are not defined, the fragment is removed by the preprocessor and is not present in the build. Therefore this code fragment is not dead code."
