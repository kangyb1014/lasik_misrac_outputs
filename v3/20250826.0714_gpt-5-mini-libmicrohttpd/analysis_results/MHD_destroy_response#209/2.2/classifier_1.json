  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_destroy_response:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN void\nMHD_destroy_response (struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n  if (0 != --(response->reference_count))\n  {\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n    MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n    return;\n  }\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n  MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n  if (NULL != response->crfc)\n    response->crfc (response->crc_cls);\n\n  if (NULL != response->data_iov)\n  {\n    free (response->data_iov);\n  }\n\n  while (NULL != response->first_header)\n  {\n    pos = response->first_header;\n    response->first_header = pos->next;\n    free (pos->header);\n    free (pos->value);\n    free (pos);\n  }\n  free (response);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n  MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n#endif\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is executed when threading support is enabled (MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) and the reference_count has just been decremented to zero. In that case the mutex must be unlocked and then destroyed; removing either call would change program behaviour (destroying a locked mutex is invalid/undefined on most platforms). When threading is not enabled the fragment is removed by conditional compilation, so it is not dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
