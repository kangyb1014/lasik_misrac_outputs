  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for compiler/language extensions explicitly present in the source text. The code contains no explicit compiler-specific extension tokens or constructs that are documented as extensions (examples that would be reported: __attribute__ ((...)), __declspec(...), __asm, asm(...), typeof(...), GNU statement expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_* intrinsics, __extension__, _Pragma with implementation-specific pragmas, Microsoft-specific extensions like __fastcall, etc.).\n\nNotes on potentially concerning identifiers that are NOT reported:\n- _MHD_EXTERN appears as a macro name, but the source does not show its expansion. The macro name itself is not an explicit language extension in the code fragment shown; any extension would only be visible in its definition, which is not part of the supplied code. Therefore it is not reported here.\n- Identifiers with trailing or leading underscores (for example MHD_mutex_lock_chk_) are ordinary identifiers in the fragment; reserved-identifiers rules or naming conventions are not the same as compiler language extensions and are outside the scope of Rule 1.2 as specified here.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (defined(...)) and calls to standard library routines (free) are standard C and not extensions.\n\nBecause no explicit compiler extension constructs are present in the shown code, there are no suspicious fragments to flag for Rule 1.2 based on the provided source alone."
