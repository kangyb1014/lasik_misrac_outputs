  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer 'pos' is declared as 'struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *' and is used to remove and free list nodes (response->first_header is updated, pos is used to access and free members and then freed). Because the pointed-to objects are modified/freed, making the pointer point to a const-qualified type would be inappropriate. (A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for read-only access and never used to modify or free the pointed object.)"
