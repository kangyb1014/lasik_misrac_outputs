  "scenario": "Cannot determine from this fragment alone. The shown usage (free(response->data_iov)) does not by itself violate Rule 8.13 because the rule concerns the declaration of pointer types (they should be const-qualified when possible). A concrete violation scenario would be: response->data_iov is declared as, for example, 'struct MHD_Data_Iov *data_iov;' but the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere \u2014 therefore it should have been declared as 'const struct MHD_Data_Iov *data_iov;'. In that case the code violates Rule 8.13 (lack of const qualification). Note: changing the declaration to a pointer-to-const would require attention when calling free (casting would discard const and may create other MISRA issues)."
