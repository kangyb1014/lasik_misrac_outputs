  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the parameter variable response itself (no assignments to response, no increments/decrements of the pointer). All operations modify the object pointed to by response or use addresses of its members: \n- Checking for NULL and returning does not modify the parameter.\n- Passing &response->mutex to lock/unlock/destroy functions uses the address of a member but does not change the pointer variable.\n- The pre-decrement --(response->reference_count) modifies a member (the referenced object), which is permitted by the rule.\n- Calls through members (response->crfc(response->crc_cls)), freeing member-allocated memory (free(response->data_iov), free(pos->header), free(pos->value), free(pos)) and updating the linked-list field (response->first_header = pos->next) all modify the object pointed to, not the pointer variable itself \u2014 these are allowed by Rule 17.8.\n- The final free(response) deallocates the object pointed to but does not assign to or change the pointer parameter variable.\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (the pointer parameter being modified)."
