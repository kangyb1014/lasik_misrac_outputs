  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in this code fragment. The snippet only performs integer assignments, integer comparisons (e.g. if (0 < res)), function calls, preprocessor conditional compilation and returns. There are no string operations or comparisons of null-terminated strings here, so no code in this fragment needs investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: called functions such as mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_* are outside this snippet and would need to be inspected separately if available.)"
