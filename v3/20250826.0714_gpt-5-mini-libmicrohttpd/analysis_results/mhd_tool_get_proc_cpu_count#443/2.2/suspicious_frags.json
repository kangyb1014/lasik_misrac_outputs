  "explanation": "Investigate the platform-specific function calls and the alternative preprocessor branch because those operations are the likely candidates for dead code: some of these calls may never be compiled or may always be no-ops/return a constant on the project's target platforms, making their execution (or the existence of the alternative branch) redundant. The other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the function signature and local declaration (int res;) are necessary scaffolding; the checks 'if (0 < res) return res;' are active control flow used to return early on success and are not dead by themselves; the comments and whitespace are non-executable; and the overall structure is a clear sequence of fallbacks \u2014 only the platform-specific implementations/calls and the mutually exclusive preprocessor branches warrant checking to ensure they are not executed (or present) without effect."
