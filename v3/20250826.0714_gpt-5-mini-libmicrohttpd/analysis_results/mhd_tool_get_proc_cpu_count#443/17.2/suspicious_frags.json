  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect self-calls; only calls to other functions can create indirect recursion back to mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count. Therefore all call sites to the helper functions are reported for investigation to determine whether any of those functions call (directly or indirectly) mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count or each other. Other fragments in the function \u2014 the local variable declaration (int res;), the conditional checks (if (0 < res) return res;), return -1;, preprocessor directives (#if/#else/#endif) and comments \u2014 do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves create recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
