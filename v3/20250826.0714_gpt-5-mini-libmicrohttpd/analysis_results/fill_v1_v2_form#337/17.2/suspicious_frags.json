  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they are plain, non-callback standard-library calls or simple local operations that cannot directly or indirectly invoke the current function: strlen(), malloc(), snprintf(), the explicit free(reply) call(s), fprintf(), the slen computation and the (void) cls cast are not passing function pointers or registering callbacks and therefore are not a plausible source of indirect recursion back into fill_v1_v2_form. The selected fragments were chosen because they either register or rely on external library-managed callbacks or response lifecycle functions (which may invoke stored callbacks or other handlers) or call into library routines that manage request/response dispatching and therefore must be inspected for possible indirect calls to this function."
