  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. Although the statement (void) cls; has no runtime effect and removing it will not change the program's observable behaviour at execution time, MISRA C's concept of \u201cdead code\u201d in Rule 2.2 is intended to catch leftover/unused logic that indicates an implementation error or unnecessary code paths, not the intentional use of a no-op expression to document/silence an unused-parameter warning. The (void) cls; idiom is a deliberate, well-understood way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused (it affects diagnostics, not runtime behaviour). In practice this is accepted as a way to avoid spurious warnings and is not treated as the kind of dead code Rule 2.2 targets. If you prefer to avoid the cast idiom for stylistic or tool-specific reasons, alternatives are: omit the parameter name in the function definition if permitted, use a standardized UNUSED macro, or use a compiler-specific attribute to mark the parameter as unused. But the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is not correct."
