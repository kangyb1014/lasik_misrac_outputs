True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nViolation occurs if struct Session declares value_1 and value_2 as non-const char * (e.g. char *value_1, *value_2). In the fragment these members are only read (passed to strlen/snprintf), so they should be declared as const char * to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. SECOND_PAGE (a string literal) is already effectively const and is acceptable.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's observation is correct in principle but conditional on the unseen declaration of struct Session. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. In the shown function value_1 and value_2 are only read (passed to strlen and used as %s in snprintf), so if struct Session actually declares them as non-const (e.g. char *value_1, *value_2) and they are never modified anywhere else, that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const char *value_1, *value_2.\n\nHowever, the fragment as provided does not include the definition of struct Session, nor the rest of the program; if those members are modified elsewhere, then they cannot be const and no violation would occur. (SECOND_PAGE being a string literal is effectively const and is fine.) Recommendation: make the members const char * when possible, or justify why they must remain non-const if they are modified elsewhere."
