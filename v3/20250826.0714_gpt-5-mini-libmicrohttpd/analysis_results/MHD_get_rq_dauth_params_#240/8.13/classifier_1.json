  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local variable dauth is used for initialization (memset and parse_dauth_params write into it), so it must be a pointer to a non-const object. The persistent member connection->rq.dauth (and the function return type) is const-qualified, so the long\u2011lived pointer is const where possible. Assigning the modifiable dauth (struct MHD_RqDAuth *) to a const-qualified destination is allowed and aligns with Rule 8.13. A violation would occur only if the object were never modified and could have been declared as a pointer to const but was not, which is not the case here."
