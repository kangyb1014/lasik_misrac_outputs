  "explanation": "I inspected all other statements and found they affect program behaviour or are not executed (and so are not 'dead' per the rule's note on unreachable code) as follows: - The request allocation and *req_cls initialisation plus the early return are required to set up per-connection state; removing them would change behaviour. - Post-processor creation, MHD_post_process calls, the *upload_data_size handling and the early returns are part of the POST protocol flow; removing any of them would alter behaviour. - The MHD_destroy_post_processor call and request->pp = NULL are side-effecting cleanup required for correct operations. - Reassigning method to MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and selecting url = request->post_url affect which page is served and so are behavioural. - The pages lookup loop and subsequent pages[i].handler(...) invocation drive the GET/HEAD response; they are behaviourally significant. - The fallback response creation, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response are necessary to generate the error response. - Variable declarations and casts (for example the cast to (const void *) METHOD_ERROR) are either used by the logic or are compile-time constructs and not executed runtime operations. - session->start = time(NULL) records timing information; removing it would change observable behaviour. Therefore, apart from the two explicit (void) no-op statements (used to silence compiler warnings), I found no other candidates that meet the Rule 2.2 definition of executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
