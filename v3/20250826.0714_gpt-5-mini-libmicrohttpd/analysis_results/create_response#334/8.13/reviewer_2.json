True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nPotential violation: the call passes a non-const struct Request * (request) as the user-data argument to MHD_create_post_processor. If the post-processor and the post_iterator callback only read from the supplied user-data (i.e. they do not modify the object), then that pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void * or const struct Request *) and the API should accept a const pointer. In that case the current use of a non-const pointer violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, the post-processor or callbacks legitimately modify the request object, then a non-const pointer is required and there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should be to const-qualified types when the pointed-to object is not modified. The report asserts a violation because the code passes a non-const struct Request * (request) as user-data to MHD_create_post_processor and suggests that if the post-processor only reads the data it should have been const.\n\nFrom the shown code there is no evidence that the pointer could be const: this function itself modifies the request object (e.g. *req_cls = request; request->pp = ...; request->pp is later destroyed and request->session is assigned). Furthermore, it is likely (and common) that the post-processor callback (post_iterator) will update the request (for example to store parsed POST data or set request->post_url). If the request object is legitimately modified by this code or by the callbacks, a non-const pointer is required and there is no MISRA 8.13 violation in this function.\n\nIf, hypothetically, the post-processor and its callbacks only ever read the object, then the API signature (and/or the callback prototype) should have used const-qualified pointer types; that would be an issue in the API design rather than this call site. But there is no evidence in the provided code that the object is only read, so the agent A report is not substantiated.\n\nTherefore the reported violation is not correct based on the provided code."
