  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns declarations: a pointer shall point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The excerpt of create_response itself does not contain a direct violation of that rule \u2014 no local pointer declarations in this function are missing an available const qualifier. The only uses relevant to the rule are accesses of fields of the pages[] table (pages[i].mime, pages[i].handler_cls) and the way they are passed to pages[i].handler. Whether a rule violation actually exists depends on how pages and handler are declared elsewhere:\n\n- If pages[i].mime is declared as char *mime but the strings are string literals (or otherwise read-only) and the code never intends to modify them, then pages[i].mime should be declared const char *mime to comply with Rule 8.13.\n- Similarly, if handler_cls is a pointer to read-only data it should be declared const (e.g. const void *handler_cls), and the handlers should accept const-qualified parameters as appropriate.\n\nBecause the definition of pages and the handler prototype are not shown, the report cannot be confirmed from the provided code alone. The agent\u2019s scenario is plausible (and if the pages[] declarations are non-const while pointing to immutable data it would indeed violate Rule 8.13), but it is not proven by the snippet. Recommendation: inspect the pages[] structure and handler prototype; if the data is immutable, change the member types and handler parameter types to const-qualified pointer types to satisfy Rule 8.13."
