  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no use of compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions (GCC), __declspec, MSVC-specific extensions, inline assembler, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- The preprocessor conditionals (#if defined / #elif / #endif) are standard C preprocessor usage, not extensions.\n- Calls to fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort and use of macros like F_GETFL, O_NONBLOCK, F_SETFL, FIONBIO are platform/OS API calls and macros (POSIX/Winsock) \u2014 these are not compiler language extensions and thus are outside the scope of MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 as stated.\n- Type casts (e.g. (int) FIONBIO), standard declarations, and control flow are all standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for use of compiler language extensions per Rule 1.2."
