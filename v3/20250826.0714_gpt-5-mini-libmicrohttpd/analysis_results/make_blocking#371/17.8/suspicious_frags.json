  "explanation": "No fragments modify the function parameter 'fd'. The code only uses 'fd' as an argument (passed by value) to fcntl and ioctlsocket; there are no assignments, increments/decrements, or reassignments to 'fd' anywhere. Local variables 'flags' and 'flags = 0' are distinct from the parameter and are modified only locally (passing &flags to ioctlsocket modifies the local object, which is permitted). The casts (e.g. (int) FIONBIO) and calls to abort() do not alter the parameter. Both compile-time branches (MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS) therefore comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 with respect to the function parameter."
