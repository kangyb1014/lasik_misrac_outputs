  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions of iteration statements (for, while, do-while). The provided function contains no iteration statements \u2014 only preprocessor conditionals and if statements. Preprocessor #if/#elif are not runtime controlling expressions for MISRA Rule 14.3, and ordinary if-conditionals are not iteration controlling expressions covered by this rule. The do-while exception is not applicable because there is no do-while in the code. All conditional expressions present (e.g. checks on fcntl/ioctlsocket return values and bitwise tests) depend on runtime values and are not invariant. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
