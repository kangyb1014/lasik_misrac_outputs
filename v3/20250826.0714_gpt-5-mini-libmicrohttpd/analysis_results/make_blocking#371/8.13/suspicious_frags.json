  "explanation": "The only pointer expression in this function is the address-of operator on the local variable 'flags' passed to ioctlsocket; therefore this is the sole fragment that needs investigation for Rule 8.13. Other parts do not involve pointers that could or should be const-qualified: the POSIX branch uses fcntl with integer values (no pointer arguments), the declarations (int flags; unsigned long flags) are non-pointer objects, the casts (e.g. (int) FIONBIO) are not pointer casts, and the parameter 'fd' is a socket descriptor type (not a pointer in this code). Hence no additional fragments in this function are relevant to Rule 8.13."
