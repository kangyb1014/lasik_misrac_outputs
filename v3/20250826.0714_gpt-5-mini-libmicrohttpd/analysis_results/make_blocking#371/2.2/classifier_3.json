  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of make_blocking:\n```c\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. All code in the active compilation branch performs observable actions (fcntl/ioctlsocket calls and abort on error); removing those calls would change program behaviour. The other socket-API branch is excluded by preprocessor and therefore not executed, and there is no executed operation that can be removed without affecting behaviour."
