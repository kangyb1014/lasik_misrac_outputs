  "explanation": "Fragments not selected do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 because they are active functional operations or necessary error handling when the function is invoked: - The fcntl(F_GETFL) call and its immediate error check (if (-1 == flags) abort ();) are runtime operations whose removal would change behavior when the function is used. - The fcntl(F_SETFL, ...) call (inside the conditional) is an actual state-changing operation (clearing O_NONBLOCK) and is not dead when the condition can be true. - The ioctlsocket call in the Windows branch is likewise an actual socket-mode change and its error handling is meaningful. - The abort() calls are observable program-termination behavior and therefore not removable without changing program behavior. Note: unreachable code is not the same as dead code; without whole-program context (whether the static function is ever called or which macros are defined), the safe candidates for inspection are those listed in suspicious_frags. Other lines are part of those operations and are not individually removable without altering runtime behavior."
