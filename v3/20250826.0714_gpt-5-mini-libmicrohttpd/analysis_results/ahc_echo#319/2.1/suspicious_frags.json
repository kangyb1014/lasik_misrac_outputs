  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function do not appear to create unreachable code and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the (void) casts for unused parameters are deliberately suppressing compiler warnings and are reachable/harmless; the cast of cls to struct handler_param and the subsequent use of param->response_page are reachable only when the earlier control-flow checks pass; the response creation, queuing and destruction (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) are reachable from the path that proceeds past the early returns. The only locations that affect control flow via early returns or by storing a token in *req_cls (which could make the remainder of the function unreachable depending on runtime values) are the four fragments listed above and thus should be investigated for possible unreachable-code issues."
