According to Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. const void *cls or const struct handler_param *), so the current declaration/cast violates the rule. Note: if this function signature is mandated by the external API (libmicrohttpd callback), the signature cannot be changed; in that case the violation is due to the non-const cast/use inside the function.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should be to const-qualified types whenever possible. In this function the parameter cls is a void * which is cast to struct handler_param * (non-const) even though the function only reads from param->response_page. That means the pointer could and should be a pointer-to-const (e.g. const struct handler_param *param = (const struct handler_param *)cls;). If the callback prototype were changeable the parameter itself could be declared as const void *cls; when the prototype is fixed by an external API (libmicrohttpd) the correct remediation is to perform the cast to a const-qualified target type rather than to a non-const type. The only time the non-const cast would be acceptable is if the function actually needs to modify the pointee. Given the code shown, Agent A's report is correct."
