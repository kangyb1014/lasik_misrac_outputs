  "explanation": "All other code lines do not perform function calls that could plausibly lead to ahc_echo being called (directly or indirectly): strcmp and strlen are standard library functions and are not expected to call back into this handler; the assignments and pointer comparisons involving aptr and req_cls only manipulate data and do not invoke functions; the early returns prevent further execution when conditions fail. The cast from void *cls to struct handler_param * and subsequent access of param->response_page is a simple data access, not a function invocation. Therefore only the three MHD_* API calls shown above warrant investigation for potential indirect invocation of the handler."
