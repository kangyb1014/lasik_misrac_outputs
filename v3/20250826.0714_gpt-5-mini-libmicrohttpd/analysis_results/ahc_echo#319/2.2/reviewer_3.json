  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void) upload_data_size;\u201d is an expression-statement that is executed but has no effect (the cast discards the value and the operand has no side effects). Removing that statement would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour, so it matches the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The same reasoning applies to the similar (void) casts for the other unused parameters in this function. To remedy this while avoiding warnings one can e.g. omit parameter names where allowed, use a compiler-supported unused-parameter attribute, or use a macro that expands to nothing in production builds rather than an executed no-op expression."
