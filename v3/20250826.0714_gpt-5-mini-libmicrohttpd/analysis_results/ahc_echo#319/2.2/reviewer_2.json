  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements like \"(void) version;\" are expression statements that execute but have no effect; removing them would not change program behaviour. That matches the rule text: \"Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.\" These lines therefore constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note that such casts are commonly used to silence compiler warnings about unused parameters, but that does not change the fact they are no\u2011ops at runtime and thus fall under the rule. To comply, the code should be changed (for example by omitting parameter names where allowed, using a compiler/annotation mechanism to mark parameters as intentionally unused, or applying an approved deviation) rather than leaving no\u2011op casts in the production code without justification."
