  "explanation": "Other code fragments need not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they perform observable or required behaviour: - The method check (if (0 != strcmp (method, \"GET\")) return MHD_NO;) affects control flow and response behavior. - The request-class handshake (if (&aptr != *req_cls) { *req_cls = &aptr; return MHD_YES; } *req_cls = NULL;) is required by the server framework to defer responding until the second call; removing it would change observable timing/behaviour. - The static sentinel declaration (static int aptr;) is used to provide a stable address for the handshake and thus affects behaviour. - The parameter assignment (struct handler_param *param = (struct handler_param *) cls;) is used later to access param->response_page; removing it would break functionality. - Response creation, queuing and destruction (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) produce the HTTP response and are therefore required. - The function return values and variable ret are used to propagate result codes. The only statements that are executed but have no effect on program behaviour (and thus are suspicious for dead code) are the explicit (void) casts used solely to silence compiler warnings for unused parameters. These casts do not change runtime behaviour and their removal would not affect the program (aside from compiler diagnostics). No other unreachable or dead code patterns are present in the shown function."
