  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The code uses strcmp (if (0 != strcmp (method, \"GET\"))) to compare the method string to the literal \"GET\", which is the correct function for null-terminated string comparison and does not violate Rule 21.14. Other operations (pointer comparison &aptr != *req_cls, strlen(param->response_page), casts of cls to struct handler_param *) are not uses of memcmp and are therefore not relevant to Rule 21.14. Consequently there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for this specific MISRA rule."
