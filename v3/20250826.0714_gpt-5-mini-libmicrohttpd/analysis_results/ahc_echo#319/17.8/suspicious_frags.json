  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters (the pointer itself must not be changed; modifying the object pointed to is allowed). The only parameter-related operations in this function that could require investigation are those involving the req_cls parameter (a void **). The fragments above cover the function signature where req_cls is declared and the locations where the object pointed to by req_cls is written and compared. Other lines in the function do not modify parameter variables: they either read parameters, cast and copy parameter values into local variables, suppress unused-parameter warnings, call library functions, or return. No other assignment targets use the parameter identifiers themselves, so no other parts of the function appear to be relevant to Rule 17.8."
