  "explanation": "I selected every controlling expression (all if-statements) in the function because Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions; these are the places where an invariant condition could occur and therefore should be investigated. Other fragments of the code are not controlling expressions (casts to void, variable declarations, assignments, calls like strdup/strlen/free/MHD_queue_response/MHD_destroy_response, return statements, and response creation) and thus are outside the scope of Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements in this function that would introduce additional controlling expressions to inspect, nor are there obvious compile-time constant conditionals (e.g., while(1) or if (0)) elsewhere in the function."
