True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe expression-statement '(void) version;' is an executed no-op used to silence an unused-parameter warning. It performs no observable action at runtime for the given parameter type (const char *), so removing it would not affect program behaviour. Therefore this is dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If 'version' were volatile or its evaluation had side-effects, the judgement could differ.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's assessment is correct. The expression-statement \u201c(void) version;\u201d is an executed no-op: it forces evaluation of the non-volatile parameter value and discards it. For a plain const char * parameter (not volatile and with no observable side-effects on evaluation) removing that statement would not change program behaviour, so it meets the rule's definition of dead code. (If the object were volatile or its evaluation produced side-effects, the statement would not be dead; Agent A noted that caveat.) Therefore the code as written violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 unless a project-specific justification/exception is documented or an alternative, non-executed means of marking the parameter as intentionally unused is used (for example omitting the parameter name in the function definition, or use of a compiler-supported UNUSED attribute)."
