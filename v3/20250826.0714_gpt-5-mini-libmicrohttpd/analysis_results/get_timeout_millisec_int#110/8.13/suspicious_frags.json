  "explanation": "Only pointer occurrences in this function are the function parameter and its use when calling get_timeout_millisec_. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types; therefore other code fragments do not need investigation: local variables (res), integer types and constants (int64_t, int, int32_t, INT_MAX), the conditional compilation and casting ((int) res), and the SIZEOF_* macros are not pointer declarations or pointer usages relevant to Rule 8.13. No other pointer declarations or pointer operations appear in the shown code, so they are not candidates for investigation under this rule."
