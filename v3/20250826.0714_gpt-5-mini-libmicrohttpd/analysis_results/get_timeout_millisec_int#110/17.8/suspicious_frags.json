  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are: a pointer parameter (daemon) and a scalar parameter (max_timeout). Within the function body there are no assignments to either parameter (no statements like daemon = ... or max_timeout = ...). Passing the parameters to get_timeout_millisec_ is allowed and does not itself modify the parameter variables in this function; the object referenced by the pointer may be modified by that callee (which is permitted by the rule), but the pointer variable in this function is not altered. All other operations (assignment to the local variable res, comparison with INT_MAX, and casting/res return) operate on local data and do not modify the incoming parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing to report for investigation."
