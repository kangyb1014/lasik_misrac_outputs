  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function use any of the <string.h> functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The function only performs integer operations: calls get_timeout_millisec_ (assigned to an int64_t), compares the int64_t with INT_MAX under a SIZEOF_INT conditional, and casts the value to int for return. There are no char pointers, buffer accesses, memory copy/set operations, or other buffer-manipulating calls in this fragment. Therefore nothing here can violate Rule 21.17. (If get_timeout_millisec_ internally uses string.h functions, that would need separate inspection, but it is outside the presented code fragment.)"
