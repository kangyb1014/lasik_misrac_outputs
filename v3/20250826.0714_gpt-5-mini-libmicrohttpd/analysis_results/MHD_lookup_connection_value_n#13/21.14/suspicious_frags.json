  "explanation": "No direct use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided function. The comparisons in the code are: pointer equality (key == pos->header), a size comparison (key_size == pos->header_size), and a call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ with an explicit length argument. None of these are memcmp calls comparing null-terminated strings. The MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ call is a binary, length\u2011bounded comparison (note the trailing _n and the explicit key_size), so it does not indicate a memcmp against null-terminated strings in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
