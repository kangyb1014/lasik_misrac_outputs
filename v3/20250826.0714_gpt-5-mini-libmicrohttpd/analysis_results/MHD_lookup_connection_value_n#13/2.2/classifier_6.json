Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_lookup_connection_value_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                               enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                               const char *key,\n                               size_t key_size,\n                               const char **value_ptr,\n                               size_t *value_size_ptr)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (NULL == pos->header) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (key_size == pos->header_size) &&\n           ( (key == pos->header) ||\n             (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (key,\n                                             pos->header,\n                                             key_size) ) ) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (NULL == pos)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL != value_ptr)\n    *value_ptr = pos->value;\n\n  if (NULL != value_size_ptr)\n    *value_size_ptr = pos->value_size;\n\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (NULL == key)\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (NULL == pos->header) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is executed when key == NULL to search for a header node whose header pointer is NULL and then break; nothing in the snippet proves such nodes cannot exist, and removing the branch would change control flow and function result. Therefore this cannot be declared dead code. (It would only be a Rule 2.2 violation if program invariants guaranteed pos->header is never NULL, in which case the conditional/break would never affect behaviour.)"
