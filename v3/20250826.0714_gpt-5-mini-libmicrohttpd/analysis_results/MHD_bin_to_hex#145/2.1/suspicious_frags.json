  "explanation": "I examined the entire function control flow for any unreachable statements or blocks. The function has a single for-loop controlled by i from 0 to size (both size_t), with all statements inside the loop reachable whenever the loop executes; the body contains no early returns, goto, break that would render subsequent statements unreachable. If size is zero the loop body is simply not entered (intended behavior) and the final return i * 2 is reached \u2014 there is no code following that return to be unreachable. All assignments and ternary expressions in the loop depend on runtime values (b and its nibbles), so neither branch of the ternary operator is statically unreachable. No other functions, labels, or conditional compilation constructs are present that could introduce unreachable code. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
