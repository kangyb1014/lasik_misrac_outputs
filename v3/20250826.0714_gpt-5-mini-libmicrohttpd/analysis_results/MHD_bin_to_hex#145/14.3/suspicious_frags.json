  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Specifically:\n- The for-loop controlling expression (i < size) depends on the function parameter size and the loop variable i, so it is not invariant.\n- The ternary conditional expressions (j < 10) are evaluated on j, which is assigned from b >> 4 and b & 0x0f (derived from the input buffer), so they are not invariant.\n- There are no while or do-while loops with constant/false controlling expressions, nor any intentionally infinite loops.\n- No other conditional or loop controlling expressions in this function are constant or invariant at compile time.\nTherefore, there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
