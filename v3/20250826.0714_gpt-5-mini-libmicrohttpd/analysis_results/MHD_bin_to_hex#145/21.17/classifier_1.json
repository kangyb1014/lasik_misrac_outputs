  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment 'return i * 2;' merely returns the computed length and does not call any functions from <string.h>. Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy) causing out-of-bounds accesses, which this return statement does not perform. (Note: a different violation could occur if the caller supplied a hex buffer smaller than 2*size causing the earlier writes hex[i*2] / hex[i*2+1] to go out of bounds, but that is not an instance of Rule 21.17 related to string.h usage.)"
