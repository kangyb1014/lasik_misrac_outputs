  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the loop does not call any functions from <string.h>. However, the code can still produce out-of-bounds accesses if the caller provides a hex buffer shorter than 2*size or a bin buffer shorter than size (i.e. hex and bin must be sized appropriately), but that is not a violation of Rule 21.17 which specifically concerns use of <string.h> functions."
