  "explanation": "I selected all locations in the function that perform calls which could potentially lead to indirect recursion back into compress_buf. In particular, deflate(...) is included because the zlib implementation may call user-supplied allocation/free callbacks or other hooks reachable from the provided z_stream, which could indirectly re-enter application code. The standard library calls realloc, free and memcpy are also listed because in some environments they may be replaced/wrapped by user code (or instrumentation) that could call back into application functions. Other fragments in the function are simple assignments, arithmetic, casts, control-flow constructs, variable declarations or return statements; these do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
