  "explanation": "The memchr call and the subsequent if-block that sends ERR_MSG_REQUEST_CHUNK_LINE_EXT_TOO_BIG are flagged because the in-code comment explicitly states \"It could be removed without any loss of the details of the request.\" That indicates these operations may be executed yet removable without affecting overall behaviour \u2014 matching the definition of dead code per Rule 2.2 and thus they should be investigated. Other parts of the function are not flagged because: - The final call sequence (err_code = get_no_space_err_status_code(...); transmit_error_response_static(...)) is the primary error-path that determines the response and thus cannot be removed without changing behaviour. - The NULL check on chunk_size_line is necessary to avoid calling memchr with a NULL pointer. - The err_code variable is used to hold the return of get_no_space_err_status_code and is required for the final transmit call. - There is no unreachable code visible here; all other statements are exercised along normal execution paths and affect observable behaviour (response content or status). Therefore no other fragments appear to be dead code."
