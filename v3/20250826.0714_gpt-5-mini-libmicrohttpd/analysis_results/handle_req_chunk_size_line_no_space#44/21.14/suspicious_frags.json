  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp. It uses memchr (to locate ';' within a buffer of given size), which does not violate the rule because it is a search function and operates with an explicit length rather than comparing null-terminated strings. The other calls in this fragment (get_no_space_err_status_code and transmit_error_response_static) are function calls but contain no visible memcmp usage in this code fragment; without their implementations there is no evidence here of memcmp being used. Therefore there are no code fragments in the shown function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
