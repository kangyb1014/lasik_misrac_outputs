  "explanation": "The only potential unreachable-code concern in this function stems from the interaction with transmit_error_response_static: if that function is non-returning (noreturn/terminating), then any code following its call would be unreachable. Therefore the inner transmit_error_response_static call (inside the semicol check) and the subsequent err_code assignment + final transmit call are flagged for investigation. No other constructs in this function indicate unreachable code: there are no early returns, no constant-condition branches, no infinite loops or jumps that would make other statements unreachable. If transmit_error_response_static is confirmed to return normally, then the flagged fragments are not unreachable and no further investigation is needed for this function."
