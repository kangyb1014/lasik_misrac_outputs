  "explanation": "The only operations relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this snippet are the direct dereferences of params_str and the passing of params_str to another function that may use <string.h> functions. These three fragments must be investigated to ensure params_str is non-NULL, points to a valid NUL-terminated object, and that process_short_param does not invoke string.h functions in a way that accesses beyond the object bounds. Other lines (fprintf, enum declaration, return statements, the do/while structure itself apart from the shown condition, and local variable declaration) do not perform string handling or pointer dereferences that could violate Rule 21.17, so they do not need investigation in this context."
