  "explanation": "The other code fragments do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The local enum variable and the fprintf call do not involve pointers to non-const data. The function increments the params_str pointer ((++params_str)[0]) which modifies the pointer value but does not alter the pointed-to characters \u2014 the parameters are declared as const char * so the pointed-to type is already const-qualified. The only places that could conceal a violation of Rule 8.13 are (a) the call to process_short_param, because that callee's parameter types must be checked to ensure they accept const-qualified pointers, and (b) the function's own parameter declarations (provided above) which should be corroborated against any prototypes/definitions elsewhere to ensure the pointed-to types are indeed const-qualified throughout. No other pointer usages appear in this fragment that would require further inspection for Rule 8.13."
