  "explanation": "The function body does not contain a direct call to itself, so there is no direct recursion to investigate. The only call within this function that could introduce indirect recursion is the call to process_short_param; that callee must be inspected to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls process_short_params_str. Other code fragments are not relevant to Rule 17.2: the loop using (++params_str) is iterative, not recursive; the fprintf call is to a library function and cannot cause recursion to this function; the return statements only propagate results and do not perform calls that could create recursion; and the final return with PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR is not a function call. Therefore only the function itself and its call to process_short_param need investigation for potential indirect recursion."
