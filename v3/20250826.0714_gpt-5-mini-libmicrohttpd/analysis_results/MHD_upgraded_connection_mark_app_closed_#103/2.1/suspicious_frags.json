  "explanation": "No definite unreachable code fragments were found in this function. The function contains no unconditional return, infinite loop, goto, or switch/case constructs that would make subsequent statements unreachable. Conditional constructs are: the preprocessor guards (#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS) and #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) which simply include or exclude code at compile time (not making any remaining code unreachable), and a runtime if (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_(daemon->itc) && !MHD_itc_activate_(...)) whose truth value cannot be determined from this snippet alone \u2014 therefore it cannot be classified as statically unreachable. The mhd_assert calls may abort at runtime when a condition fails, but assertions do not constitute statically unreachable code in the source as required by MISRA Rule 2.1. Consequently, there are no source fragments in this function that can be conclusively identified as unreachable and needing further investigation."
