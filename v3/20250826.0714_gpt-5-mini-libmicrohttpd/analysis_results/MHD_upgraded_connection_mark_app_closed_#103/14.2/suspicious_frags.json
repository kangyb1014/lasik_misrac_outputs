First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function. Rule 14.2 applies specifically to the structure and contents of for loops (first/second/third clause, single loop counter, no modification of the counter in the body, no persistent side-effects in the second clause, etc.). The code shown contains only variable declarations, assertions, mutex lock/unlock, boolean field assignments, and function/macro calls; there are no for-loop constructs to inspect. \n\nNote: Some identifiers (macros/functions) such as MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, etc., could expand or call code which contains for loops, but those loops would be outside the fragment provided. Since the task is to identify suspicious fragments within the given code, and no for loops appear here, there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
