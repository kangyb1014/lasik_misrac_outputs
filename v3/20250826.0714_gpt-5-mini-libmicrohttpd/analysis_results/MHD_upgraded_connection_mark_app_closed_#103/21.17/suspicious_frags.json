  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in this function. There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other standard string-handling function. The code only performs pointer dereferences, member assignments, mutex operations, assertions, and calls to MHD_itc_activate_ and logging macros. The only string literal in this fragment is \"r\" passed to MHD_itc_activate_; passing a literal is not itself a <string.h> operation. Similarly, the logging/gettext macro usage (the _() and MHD_DLOG lines) uses string literals but does not invoke any of the string.h functions within this function. If the called functions (e.g., MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_DLOG or the expansion of _) internally use string.h functions, those internal implementations are outside the scope of this function and would need to be reviewed in their own definitions, not here. Therefore, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
