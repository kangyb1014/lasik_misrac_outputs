  "scenario": "The call to MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ does not itself constitute a recursive (direct or indirect) call to MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_. There is no evidence in the fragment that MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ expands to, or calls, MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_, nor that it invokes a callback or function pointer which would lead back to this function. Therefore, as written, this line does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. (If MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ were implemented to call back into MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ \u2014 for example via a function pointer, macro expansion, or a callback invoked during unlock \u2014 that would create an indirect recursion and violate the rule.)"
