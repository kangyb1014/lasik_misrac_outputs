If mhd_assert expands to an expression that is executed in normal builds (e.g. evaluates the condition and possibly logs or aborts only on failure) then, for correct runs where the assertion never fails, its execution does not affect program behaviour \u2014 removing it would not change the program \u2014 so it constitutes dead code and thus violates Rule 2.2. (If, instead, mhd_assert is compiled out entirely as a no-op in the build used for the project, it is not executed and therefore not classified as dead code.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A assumes that the mhd_assert invocations are necessarily dead code because, on successful runs, they do not change program state. That is an insufficient basis to claim a Rule 2.2 violation. Whether an operation is \u201cdead code\u201d requires proof that removing it cannot affect program behaviour in any observable way. Assertions implemented by a macro like mhd_assert may (a) perform side effects (logging, calling abort/exit on failure, interacting with diagnostics), (b) read memory (which can trigger faults or depend on volatile data) or (c) affect timing in an embedded system \u2014 all of which are observable behaviours (note 1 to Rule 2.2 explicitly calls out timing). If mhd_assert is compiled out entirely in the project build, it is not executed and therefore not \u201cdead code\u201d as defined (and no issue arises). If it is compiled in, its evaluation or diagnostic actions are observable and removing them could change behaviour. Because the agent provides no evidence that these particular mhd_assert invocations have no observable effects in the relevant build/configuration, you cannot conclude they violate Rule 2.2. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
