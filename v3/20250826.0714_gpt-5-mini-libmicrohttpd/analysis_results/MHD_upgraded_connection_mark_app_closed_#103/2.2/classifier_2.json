Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  /* Cache 'daemon' here to avoid data races */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->urh);\n  mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME));\n\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  connection->urh->was_closed = true;\n  connection->resuming = true;\n  daemon->resuming = true;\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  if ( (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) &&\n       (!

  "scenario": "The mhd_assert invocation is a runtime-only diagnostic that performs a condition check with no side effects on success. If mhd_assert expands to an expression that is executed in normal builds (e.g. evaluates the condition and possibly logs or aborts only on failure) then, for correct runs where the assertion never fails, its execution does not affect program behaviour \u2014 removing it would not change the program \u2014 so it constitutes dead code and thus violates Rule 2.2. (If, instead, mhd_assert is compiled out entirely as a no-op in the build used for the project, it is not executed and therefore not classified as dead code.)"
