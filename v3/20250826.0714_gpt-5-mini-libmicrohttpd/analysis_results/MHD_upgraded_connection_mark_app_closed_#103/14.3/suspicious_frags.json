  "explanation": "Other code in this function consists of simple assignments, mutex lock/unlock calls and function calls (e.g. caching 'daemon', MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(), setting flags, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_()). Those statements do not introduce C control-flow constructs (if/while/for/do-switch) with controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements elsewhere in the function to inspect. The mhd_assert lines and the runtime if-condition were flagged because they either are control-like when the macro expands (mhd_assert may expand to control-flow) or include macros/functions (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, MHD_itc_activate_) that could expand/resolve to compile-time invariants in some build configurations; those expansions need to be examined to determine whether the controlling expressions are invariant. All other fragments are simple non-controlling expressions and do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
