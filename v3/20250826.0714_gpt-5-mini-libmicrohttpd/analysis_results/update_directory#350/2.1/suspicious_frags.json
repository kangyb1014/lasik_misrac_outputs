  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that are likely to hide unreachable code or logical errors that can make branches impossible: the repeated comments that assert an always-sufficient buffer followed by explicit buffer-size checks (which may therefore be redundant / unreachable), the final footer memcpy that writes to rdc.buf (not rdc.buf + rdc.off) which looks inconsistent with the earlier header/body writes, the initial header-size check against the static initial_allocation, the dir_name snprintf truncation/overflow check, and the FORCE_CLOSE preprocessor block. These fragments deserve investigation to determine whether any branches are actually unreachable or are the result of a coding error.\n\nWhy other code fragments need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the remaining constructs are standard, reachable error-handling and control-flow: the malloc()/free() and early-return error paths are legitimate and reachable on allocation failure; the for-loops driven by NULL-terminated arrays (languages/categories) are normal and reachable depending on runtime data; stat() checks and the resulting continue are valid runtime checks; snprintf() error checks (0 >= res) and the handling of list_directory() returning MHD_NO are valid runtime paths; creation and marking of the response and the final update_cached_response(response) are normal end-of-function operations. None of those are evidently impossible to reach from static analysis of the shown code, so they are not flagged here."
