The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of update_directory:\n```c\nstatic void\nupdate_directory (void)\n{\n  static size_t initial_allocation = 32 * 1024; /* initial size for response buffer */\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  struct ResponseDataContext rdc;\n  unsigned int language_idx;\n  unsigned int category_idx;\n  const struct Language *language;\n  const char *category;\n  char dir_name[128];\n  struct stat sbuf;\n  int res;\n  size_t len;\n\n  rdc.buf_len = initial_allocation;\n  if (NULL == (rdc.buf = malloc (rdc.buf_len)))\n  {\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  len = strlen (INDEX_PAGE_HEADER);\n  if (rdc.buf_len <= len)\n  { /* buffer too small */\n    free (rdc.buf);\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  memcpy (rdc.buf, INDEX_PAGE_HEADER, len);\n  rdc.off = len;\n  for (language_idx = 0; NULL != languages[language_idx].dirname;\n       language_idx++)\n  {\n    language = &languages[language_idx];\n\n    if (0 != stat (language->dirname, &sbuf))\n      continue; /* empty */\n    /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n       so there is always still enough space for the header\n       without need for an additional reallocation check. */\n    res = snprintf (&rdc.buf[rdc.off], rdc.buf_len - rdc.off,\n                    \"<h2>%s</h2>\\n\",\n                    language->longname);\n    if (0 >= res)\n      continue;  /* snprintf() error */\n    if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= (size_t) res)\n      continue;  /* buffer too small?? */\n    rdc.off += (size_t) res;\n    for (category_idx = 0; NULL != categories[category_idx]; category_idx++)\n    {\n      category = categories[category_idx];\n      res = snprintf (dir_name, sizeof (dir_name),\n                      \"%s/%s\",\n                      language->dirname,\n                      category);\n      if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof (dir_name) <= (size_t) res))\n        continue;  /* cannot print dir name */\n      if (0 != stat (dir_name, &sbuf))\n        continue;  /* empty */\n\n      /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n         so there is always still enough space for the header\n         without need for an additional reallocation check. */\n      res = snprintf (&rdc.buf[rdc.off], rdc.buf_len - rdc.off,\n                      \"<h3>%s</h3>\\n\",\n                      category);\n      if (0 >= res)\n        continue;  /* snprintf() error */\n      if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= (size_t) res)\n        continue;  /* buffer too small?? */\n      rdc.off += (size_t) res;\n\n      if (MHD_NO == list_directory (&rdc, dir_name))\n      {\n        free (rdc.buf);\n        update_cached_response (NULL);\n        return;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n     so there is always still enough space for the footer\n     without need for a final reallocation check. */\n  len = strlen (INDEX_PAGE_FOOTER);\n  if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= len)\n  { /* buffer too small */\n    free (rdc.buf);\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  memcpy (rdc.buf, INDEX_PAGE_FOOTER, len);\n  rdc.off += len;\n  initial_allocation = rdc.buf_len; /* remember for next time */\n  response =\n    MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback (rdc.off,\n                                                        rdc.buf,\n                                                        &free);\n  mark_as_html (response);\n#ifdef FORCE_CLOSE\n  (void) MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION,\n                                  \"close\");\n#endif\n  update_cached_response (response);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n/* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n   so there is always still enough space for the header\n   without need for an additional reallocation check. */\nres = snprintf (&rdc.buf[rdc.off], rdc.buf_len - rdc.off,\n                \"<h3>%s</h3>\\n\",\n                category);\nif (0 >= res)\n  continue;  /* snprintf() error */\nif (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= (size_t) res)\n  continue;  /* buffer too small?? */\nrdc.off += (size_t) res;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment performs runtime checks on snprintf() return value and available buffer space and conditionally continues instead of advancing rdc.off. Removing those checks would change program behaviour on snprintf errors or unexpected buffer-shortage conditions, so they are not dead code. (Even if the comment\u2019s guarantee means the buffer-too-small branch is never taken in normal operation, that would make it unreachable, and MISRA Note 2 clarifies that unreachable code is not classified as dead code.)"
