  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp or any comparisons implemented by calling memcmp in the provided function. Specific notes: \n- There is a call to strlen(form) to obtain the buffer length \u2014 strlen is allowed and is not memcmp.\n- Control-flow comparisons (NULL == response) and (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(...)) are pointer/enum/integer comparisons, not string comparisons via memcmp.\n- Calls to library functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, fprintf) do not show any memcmp usage in this code fragment.\n- No explicit memcmp, memcmp-like macro, or manual byte-wise comparison of C strings is present.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If you want, I can also scan additional files or the implementations of the called MHD_* functions to ensure they don't use memcmp on null-terminated strings."
