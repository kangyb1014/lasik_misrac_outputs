  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of serve_simple_form:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nserve_simple_form (const void *cls,\n                   const char *mime,\n                   struct Session *session,\n                   struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  const char *form = cls;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  /* return static form */\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (form),\n                                                     (const void *) form);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  add_session_cookie (session, response);\n  if (MHD_YES !=\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_ENCODING,\n                               mime))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set content encoding header!\\n\");\n  }\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                            MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                            response);\n  MHD_destroy_response (response);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_YES !=\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_ENCODING,\n                               mime))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set content encoding header!\\n\");\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fprintf call is a runtime diagnostic with observable side\u2011effects (writes to stderr) and is executed conditionally on a header-add failure. Removing it would change the program\u2019s observable behaviour (loss of the error message), so it is not dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
