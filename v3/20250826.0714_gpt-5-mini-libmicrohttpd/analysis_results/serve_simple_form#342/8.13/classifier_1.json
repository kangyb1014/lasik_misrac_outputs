  "scenario": "The pointer \u2018connection\u2019 is passed to MHD_queue_response(connection, ...), which (by its API and purpose) takes a non-const struct MHD_Connection * and modifies/uses the connection state to queue a response. Because the pointer is used with an API that expects a non-const connection and the function likely needs to allow modification, making it const would be incorrect. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated here. (If, hypothetically, the function neither modified nor passed the pointer to non-const APIs, the pointer should be declared as const struct MHD_Connection * to comply with Rule 8.13.)"
