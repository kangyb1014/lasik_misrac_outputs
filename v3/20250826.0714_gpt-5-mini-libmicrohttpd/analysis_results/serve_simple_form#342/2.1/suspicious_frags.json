  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are statically unreachable. The only unconditional return is inside the NULL-check (if (NULL == response) return MHD_NO;), which is a reachable runtime path when response is NULL. All other blocks are conditional on runtime results (e.g., result of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and MHD_add_response_header) so both their taken and not-taken paths are potentially reachable. There is no code following an unconditional return, no constant conditional (true/false) that would make a branch permanently unreachable, no dead code after loop/return, and no constructs that appear permanently disabled by preprocessor directives in the provided snippet. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
