  "explanation": "I selected the three fragments above for investigation:\n- The initial assignment \"alloc_size = 0;\" appears to be an unconditional initialization that is later overwritten on every execution path before use; it is a candidate for dead code (executed but apparently removable without changing behavior) and should be reviewed.\n- The \"if (MAP_FAILED == pool->memory) { ... }\" block is the runtime check used to fall back to malloc. This whole block should be investigated because platform-specific allocation functions (mmap vs VirtualAlloc) have different failure return values (mmap returns MAP_FAILED, VirtualAlloc returns NULL). The interplay of these checks with the preprocessor-conditioned allocation paths may make some checks ineffective or lead to unreachable/faulty behavior on some platforms.\n- The companion \"else { pool->is_mmap = true; }\" inside the MAP_ANONYMOUS | _WIN32 conditional is included because, together with the MAP_FAILED check above, it determines is_mmap. Because of the platform mismatch noted, this assignment could be misleading (e.g. a failed VirtualAlloc returning NULL would not compare equal to MAP_FAILED but still take the \"else\" path), so it merits investigation.\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 2.2:\n- The allocations (malloc/mmap/VirtualAlloc), the rounding to page granularity (the alloc_size calculation and modulus adjustment), and the assignments to pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size are functional and used later in the function; removing them would change program behavior and are not dead.\n- The initial malloc for the pool structure and the NULL check/free/return are essential error handling and not dead.\n- The platform-specific assignments of pool->memory = MAP_FAILED in the branches are used to force the fallback path and thus are purposeful, not dead.\n- The mhd_assert and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY calls are diagnostic/verification operations (and possibly compiled out), and their presence is intentional; they are not obvious dead code in the sense of being executable but removable without effect on functional behavior across configurations.\n\nThe three reported fragments are the primary parts that could represent dead or ineffective code (or platform-dependent ineffective checks) and should be examined further for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 and for correctness across platforms."
