  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in this function. The code uses: - Standard C types (size_t, uintptr_t) and casts between pointer and integer types (uintptr_t) which are standard in C99 and later. - Standard preprocessor conditionals (#if, #elif, #endif) and platform-specific macros (MAP_ANONYMOUS, _WIN32) which are not language extensions but normal portability conditionals. - OS/runtime APIs (mmap, VirtualAlloc, MAP_FAILED) \u2014 these are platform APIs, not compiler language extensions. - Macros and identifiers (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ALIGN_SIZE, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) \u2014 macros are preprocessor constructs, not language extensions; their definitions would need review if they used extensions, but their usage here does not. - Boolean literals (true/false) and bool are standard since C99 (via stdbool.h), not a compiler extension. I also checked for common compiler extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (and found none): no GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ usage, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no inline asm, no nested functions, no designated initializer extensions, no anonymous structs/unions, no use of C++ features. Note: identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter (for example _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) are reserved by the C implementation and could raise concerns under other MISRA rules or standards, but that is not a language extension and therefore not relevant to Rule 1.2. Based on the provided function body alone, there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
