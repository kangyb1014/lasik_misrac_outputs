  "explanation": "I flagged conditional-compilation and branching blocks where control flow depends on preprocessor macros and runtime tests; these are the areas that can produce unreachable code depending on build-time definitions or constant conditions and therefore deserve inspection for MISRA Rule 2.1. Other fragments were not flagged because they are straightforward, reachable in normal control flow, and do not present obvious unconditional dead code: the initial allocation and NULL check (pool = malloc; if (NULL == pool) return NULL), the later NULL check and cleanup on malloc failure inside the fallback malloc path (already included above), the final initializations (mhd_assert alignment, pool->pos/pool->end/pool->size assignments), the _MHD_POISON_MEMORY call, and the final return are all reachable and part of the normal execution paths and thus do not need investigation for unreachable-code violations."
