Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ws_get_accept_value:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nws_get_accept_value (const char *key, char **val)\n{\n  struct SHA1Context ctx;\n  unsigned char hash[SHA1HashSize];\n  char *str;\n  ssize_t len;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) || (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen (key)))\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  str = malloc (WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  if (NULL == str)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  strncpy (str, key, (WS_KEY_LEN + 1));\n  strncpy (str + WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  SHA1Reset (&ctx);\n  SHA1Input (&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN);\n  if (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash))\n  {\n    free (str);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  free (str);\n  len = BASE64Encode (hash, SHA1HashSize, val);\n  if (-1 == len)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  (*val)[len] = '\\0';\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nSHA1Input (&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to SHA1Input(&ctx, (const unsigned char *)str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN) updates the SHA1 context that is subsequently used by SHA1Result(&ctx, hash) to produce the digest which is then base64-encoded into *val. Removing the SHA1Input call would change the SHA1Result output (and thus program behaviour), so this operation is not dead code. (Also WS_KEY_LEN and WS_GUID_LEN ensure WS_KEY_GUID_LEN > 0, so the call is actually executed.)"
