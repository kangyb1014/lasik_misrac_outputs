  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function. The source uses only standard C language constructs (static, enum, pointers, function calls) and library/typedef names (malloc, free, strncpy, ssize_t) \u2014 ssize_t is a POSIX typedef provided by system headers, not a compiler language-extension keyword. There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension features such as __attribute__, __builtin_... intrinsics, typeof, asm statements, inline assembly, compiler-specific pragmas, or nonstandard keywords. Therefore there are no code fragments to flag for Rule 1.2."
