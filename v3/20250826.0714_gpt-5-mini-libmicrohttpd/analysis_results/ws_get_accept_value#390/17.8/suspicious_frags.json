  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning: \n- The parameter key is declared const char * and is not assigned to or modified anywhere; only its pointee is read (strlen, strncpy source). Reading the object or passing its address does not modify the pointer parameter itself. \n- The parameter val is declared char **. The function does not reassign the parameter variable val itself (no statements like val = ...). It calls BASE64Encode(hash, SHA1HashSize, val) which may modify *val (the object referred to by the pointer parameter) \u2014 this is permitted by the rule \u2014 and later writes (*val)[len] = '\\0', which again modifies the pointee, not the pointer parameter. \n- All other pointer operations (str allocations, use of str, SHA1Input) operate on local pointers or pointees and do not change the formal parameters themselves. \nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 17.8; no fragments need further investigation for this rule."
