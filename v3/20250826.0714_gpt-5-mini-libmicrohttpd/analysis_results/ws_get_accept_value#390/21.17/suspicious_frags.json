  "explanation": "Only the calls and expressions that affect buffer sizes and the use of string.h functions are reported because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns potential out-of-bounds accesses caused by string handling. The other fragments in the function are not string.h calls and do not directly pertain to this rule: SHA1Reset, SHA1Input, SHA1Result, BASE64Encode, free, the assignment (*val)[len] = '\\0', and the function return statements are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and therefore need not be investigated for this specific rule. The four reported fragments should be checked together because the strlen check, the malloc size, and the two strncpy calls interact to determine whether any copy may access memory beyond the allocated buffer or the source objects."
