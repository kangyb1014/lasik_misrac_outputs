  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. I searched the code for direct calls to memcmp (e.g. \"memcmp(\" or \"memcmp \") and found none. The function performs a length check with strlen and copies with strncpy, and calls SHA1/BASE64 helper functions, but there is no explicit comparison of null-terminated strings via memcmp in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used inside external helpers like BASE64Encode or SHA1* functions, those would need to be inspected separately, but they are outside the provided code.)"
