  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function. The body contains only a sequence of assignments to members of the supplied ctx object (ctx->H[0]..ctx->H[7] and ctx->count = 0) and comments. There are no control-flow constructs (no conditional statements, no loops, no goto/labels, no early return, no switch cases, no break/continue), and no conditional compilation blocks shown that could render any statements unreachable. The macro UINT32_C expands to constant integer literal wrappers and does not introduce branching or unreachable paths. Dereferencing ctx (e.g. if ctx is NULL) would be undefined behavior but is not 'unreachable code' as defined by MISRA C Rule 2.1, so it is not relevant to this rule. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for unreachable code."
