  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this snippet is the function parameter: 'struct Sha256Ctx *ctx'. This pointer is used to modify the context (assignments to ctx->H[...] and ctx->count), so it must not be const-qualified; applying const would prevent the necessary writes. There are no other pointer variables, no pointers returned, and no addresses taken that could be const-qualified. Therefore no pointers in this fragment can or should be changed to point to const-qualified types."
