Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_SHA256_init:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_SHA256_init (struct Sha256Ctx *ctx)\n{\n  /* Initial hash values, see FIPS PUB 180-4 paragraph 5.3.3 */\n  /* First thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the square\n   * roots of the first eight prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,\n   * 17, 19.\" */\n  ctx->H[0] = UINT32_C (0x6a09e667);\n  ctx->H[1] = UINT32_C (0xbb67ae85);\n  ctx->H[2] = UINT32_C (0x3c6ef372);\n  ctx->H[3] = UINT32_C (0xa54ff53a);\n  ctx->H[4] = UINT32_C (0x510e527f);\n  ctx->H[5] = UINT32_C (0x9b05688c);\n  ctx->H[6] = UINT32_C (0x1f83d9ab);\n  ctx->H[7] = UINT32_C (0x5be0cd19);\n\n  /* Initialise number of bytes. */\n  ctx->count = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  ctx->H[6] = UINT32_C (0x1f83d9ab);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
