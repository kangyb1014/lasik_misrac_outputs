  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. Both parameters are only read: thread_name is checked against NULL and both thread_id and thread_name are passed unchanged to platform-specific pthread_setname/_set_name/_setname functions. There are no assignments to either parameter (no statements like thread_name = ... or thread_id = ...), no modification via increment/decrement, and no casts or operations that would alter the pointer variables themselves. The use of the logical NOT operator on return values and the literal 0 argument in the NetBSD branch do not modify the parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 to investigate."
