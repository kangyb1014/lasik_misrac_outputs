  "explanation": "The initial NULL check (if (NULL == thread_name) return 0;) is a reachable early-exit and does not indicate unreachable code. Each return inside the conditional compilation branches is reachable when the corresponding macro is defined, and comments are not executable code. The primary concerns to investigate for Rule 2.1 are: (1) the entire #if/#elif/#elif block because different build configurations will include only one branch \u2014 the excluded branches are not part of that build (preprocessor exclusion is not a runtime unreachable-code issue, but any branch that is never selected by any build configuration should be checked across the project), and (2) the absence of a fallback (#else) branch: if none of the HAVE_PTHREAD_* macros is defined the function will fall off the end without a return value (the code after the #endif, i.e. the function closing brace), which is a problematic code path and must be investigated. Other lines in the function are either reachable, conditional on configuration, or non-executable (comments), so they do not need further investigation for unreachable-code concerns."
