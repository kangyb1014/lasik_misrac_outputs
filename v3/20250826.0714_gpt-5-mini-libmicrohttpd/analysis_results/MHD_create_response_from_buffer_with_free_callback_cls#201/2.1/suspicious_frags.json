  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the conditional checks and guarded blocks that cause immediate returns or removal by the preprocessor; these are the places most likely to produce unreachable code in some build/configuration and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1. Other parts of the function (allocation, the NULL check of r, the final sequence of assignments and the final return) are normal, intended control-flow (error checks that return on failure, followed by the normal initialization path). There is no code textually following an unconditional return in the same block, and the remaining assignment/initialization statements are reachable when the function proceeds past the earlier error returns. Preprocessor-excluded code is not executed in that build, so only the reported conditional blocks need review for potential unreachable-code issues across project configurations."
