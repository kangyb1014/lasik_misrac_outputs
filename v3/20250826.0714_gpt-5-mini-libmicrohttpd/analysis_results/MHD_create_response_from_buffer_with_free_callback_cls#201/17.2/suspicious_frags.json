  "explanation": "The fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain no function calls (only comparisons, assignments, returns or preprocessor checks) and thus cannot produce direct or indirect recursion. Examples: the NULL/size checks, the assignments to r->fd, r->reference_count, r->total_size, r->data, r->data_size, r->crfc and r->crc_cls, and the final return r; are simple operations that do not invoke any function and therefore cannot call this function directly or indirectly. The selected fragments include all function-call sites in this function (memory allocation, mutex initialization and the corresponding free), which are the only places where indirect recursion could originate and therefore warrant investigation."
