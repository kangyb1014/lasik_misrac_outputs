  "explanation": "The remainder of the code uses only standard C language constructs and library items and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 1.2. Examples include: function definition/return, struct usage, pointer assignments (r->data = buffer), standard types (size_t), NULL, integer constants, simple if/return logic, calls to the standard free(), conditional compilation using #if/#endif (standard preprocessor), and member access and initialization of struct fields. These are not compiler language extensions. The fragments listed above are macro or typedef identifiers (or preprocessor conditions) that may expand to compiler-specific keywords/attributes or platform/compiler-specific constructs (for example __attribute__ or __declspec or calling-convention qualifiers). Those should be investigated to confirm they do not use compiler language extensions."
