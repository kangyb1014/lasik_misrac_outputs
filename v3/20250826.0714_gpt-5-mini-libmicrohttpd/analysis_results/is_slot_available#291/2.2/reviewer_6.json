Because both sides are compile-time constants the condition is always true and the runtime assertion has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario described. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert in question compares two macro-derived compile-time constants (NONCE_STD_LEN(MAX_DIGEST) and MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH). If those macros are truly constant for the entire project, the test is always true at runtime; the check has no effect on program behaviour and is therefore dead code. The proper remedy is to use a compile-time check (e.g. _Static_assert) or remove the assertion.\n\nCaveats: this conclusion assumes (a) the two operands are compile-time constants in all builds and translation units, and (b) mhd_assert has no other side effects. If mhd_assert is compiled out in some configurations (so it is never executed), then it would not meet the rule\u2019s definition of dead code (which requires an executed operation). If build configurations or macro definitions can change such that the comparison might fail in some builds, keeping a runtime assert could be justified. Given the stated scenario, however, the report is correct."
