  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or intrinsics (no __attribute__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __asm, or similar).\n- No statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no nested functions, no inline assembly, no anonymous structs/unions, no designated initializers, and no GCC/Clang/MSC-specific pragmas or annotations.\n- All types used (bool, uint64_t, size_t) are standard C types or from standard headers (stdbool.h, stdint.h, stddef.h) and not compiler extensions.\n- Macros appearing in the code (NONCE_STD_LEN, TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP, mhd_assert) are preprocessor macros, not compiler language extensions; their presence alone is not an extension unless their definitions use extensions (not shown here).\n- No unusual token sequences (e.g., statement labels in expressions) were present.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can also review the macro definitions (NONCE_STD_LEN, TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP, mhd_assert, get_nonce_timestamp) to ensure they do not rely on extensions."
