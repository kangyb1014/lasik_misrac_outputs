  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> that may read/write beyond object bounds. The only direct string.h call in this snippet is memcmp \u2014 therefore the memcmp call is included. Additionally, the assertions that constrain new_nonce_len and the checks/uses of nn->nonce (nn->nonce[0], the zero-termination assertion and check) and the call passing nn->nonce to get_nonce_timestamp are included because they directly affect or determine the valid accessible length of the buffers used by memcmp (and any other function that may inspect the nonce). Other lines in the function (simple numeric comparisons, returns, timestamp arithmetic, and constant macros like REUSE_TIMEOUT/TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP) do not call string.h functions and do not change buffer bounds, so they do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this snippet."
