The call memcmp(nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len) can read new_nonce_len bytes from both nn->nonce and new_nonce. Although the code contains asserts that limit new_nonce_len relative to compile-time constants and checks nn->nonce's last byte, there is no guaranteed (checked) property in this function that the object pointed to by new_nonce is at least new_nonce_len bytes long. If the caller passes a new_nonce that references a shorter buffer (or the assertion is disabled/compiled out), memcmp will access beyond the bounds of new_nonce (and, if sizes differ unexpectedly, could also overrun nn->nonce). Therefore Rule 21.17 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The memcmp call reads new_nonce_len bytes from both nn->nonce and new_nonce. In the shown function there is no guaranteed runtime check that the object pointed to by new_nonce is at least new_nonce_len bytes long (the code only contains mhd_assert checks which may be compiled out and some checks/asserts about nn->nonce but not a robust check of new_nonce\u2019s buffer length). Therefore the call can result in out-of-bounds accesses and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 unless an external, enforced contract (or additional runtime checks) guarantees new_nonce\u2019s size. To be compliant the code must ensure at runtime (not only by asserts) that both buffers are at least new_nonce_len bytes long before calling memcmp."
