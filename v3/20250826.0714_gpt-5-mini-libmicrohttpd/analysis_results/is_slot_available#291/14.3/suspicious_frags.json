  "explanation": "No loops are present in the function. All other controlling expressions are dependent on runtime state and therefore are not (obviously) invariant and do not require investigation for Rule 14.3: \n\n- if (0 == nn->nonce[0]) \u2014 reads a runtime byte from the slot. \n- if (0 != nn->nc) \u2014 tests a runtime field. \n- mhd_assert(...) lines are assertions/contracts (not control-flow invariants to be analysed here). \n- if (0 != nn->nonce[sizeof(nn->nonce) - 1]) \u2014 inspects a runtime byte in the array. \n- timestamp_valid = get_nonce_timestamp(...); followed by if (! timestamp_valid) \u2014 depends on the runtime result of get_nonce_timestamp. \n- if ((REUSE_TIMEOUT * 1000) < TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP (now - timestamp)) \u2014 depends on the runtime values now and timestamp and the macro TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP.\n\nTherefore, aside from the fragment listed above, the other controlling expressions rely on runtime data or are assertions and do not appear to be invariant and so do not need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
