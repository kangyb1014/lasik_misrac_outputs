If try_match_header performs the comparison by calling the Standard Library function memcmp to compare the header literal against buf (even with an explicit length such as MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_), that is using memcmp to compare a null-terminated string and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If try_match_header instead uses a proper string comparison function such as strncmp/strncasecmp or a dedicated routine that does not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, then there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not deterministically correct based on the code shown. The snippet itself NUL-terminates buf (buf[newline] = '\\0'), so buf is a null\u2011terminated string at the point try_match_header is called \u2014 if try_match_header implemented its comparison by calling memcmp to compare that NUL\u2011terminated string to the literal, that WOULD violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. However, the implementation of try_match_header (and any other helper like MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) is not provided, so there is no evidence in the excerpt that memcmp is actually used. Therefore you cannot conclude a violation from the shown code alone. To confirm a real violation, inspect the implementation of try_match_header (and search the codebase for uses of memcmp that are used for string comparisons) \u2014 if any such function calls memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, then the report would be correct; otherwise it is not."
