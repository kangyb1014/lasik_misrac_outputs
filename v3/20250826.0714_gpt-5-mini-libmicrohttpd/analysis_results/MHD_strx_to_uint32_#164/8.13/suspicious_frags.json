  "explanation": "No pointer in the provided code appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rationale:\n- The input string parameter is declared as const char *str, so the pointed-to type is const-qualified and is not modified through the pointer. A local alias is declared as const char *const start, further enforcing constness.\n- The only non-const pointer parameter is uint32_t *out_val; this pointer is used to store the computed result (*out_val = res), so the pointed-to object must be modifiable and cannot be const-qualified.\n- There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-object usages in the function that could be further const-qualified.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for possible addition of const qualification under Rule 8.13."
