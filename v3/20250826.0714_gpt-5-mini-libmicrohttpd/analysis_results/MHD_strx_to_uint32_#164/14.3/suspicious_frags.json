  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found. Analysis of every controlling expression:\n\n- if (! str || ! out_val)\n  - Depends on the function parameters str and out_val; it is not an invariant constant expression.\n\n- while (digit >= 0)\n  - digit is assigned before the loop from toxdigitvalue(*str) and is updated inside the loop after advancing str (digit = toxdigitvalue(*str)); therefore the controlling expression changes and is not invariant. This is not an infinite loop (it can terminate when toxdigitvalue returns < 0).\n\n- if ((res < (UINT32_MAX / 16)) || ((res == (UINT32_MAX / 16)) && ((uint32_t) digit <= (UINT32_MAX % 16))))\n  - This compound conditional depends on the mutable variables res and digit; it is not an invariant.\n\n- if (str - start > 0)\n  - Depends on how many characters were consumed (str - start), which changes as the loop iterates; not invariant.\n\nNo other loop or branch controlling expressions (for, do-while, switch) are present. Also none of the controlling expressions are constant expressions used to create infinite loops (which would be an allowed exception). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
