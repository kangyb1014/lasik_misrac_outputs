  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to be unreachable under normal semantics. Reasoning: the initial early-return (if (!str || !out_val) return 0;) is conditional and therefore not dead; it simply guards against null inputs. The while (digit >= 0) loop is entered only when the first character is a hex digit (toxdigitvalue >= 0) and therefore is reachable for inputs that start with hex digits. Inside the loop both branches are reachable: the normal accumulation branch (res *= 16; res += digit;) is reachable at least on the first digit (res starts at 0), and the overflow branch (else return 0;) is reachable for inputs long enough to cause res to exceed the checked threshold. After the loop, the assignment *out_val = res; is executed only when at least one digit was consumed (str - start > 0) \u2014 this is intentional and reachable for inputs with digits. The final return of (str - start) is reachable on all non-null inputs. There are no unconditional return statements or statements following an unconditional return that would constitute unreachable code. (Note: this analysis assumes the customary semantics of toxdigitvalue returning -1 for non-hex characters and 0..15 for hex digits; if toxdigitvalue had nonstandard behavior, the function should be rechecked accordingly.)"
