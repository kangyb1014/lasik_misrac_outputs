  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The fragment uses standard C features (function definition, pointer arithmetic, casts, integer types from stdint.h and size_t, standard macros like UINT32_MAX). There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __extension__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords. The identifier toxdigitvalue is just a function call (not a language extension). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
