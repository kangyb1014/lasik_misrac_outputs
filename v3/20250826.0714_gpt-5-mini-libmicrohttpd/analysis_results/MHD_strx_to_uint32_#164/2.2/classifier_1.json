  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_strx_to_uint32_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_strx_to_uint32_ (const char *str,\n                     uint32_t *out_val)\n{\n  const char *const start = str;\n  uint32_t res;\n  int digit;\n\n  if (! str || ! out_val)\n    return 0;\n\n  res = 0;\n  digit = toxdigitvalue (*str);\n  while (digit >= 0)\n  {\n    if ( (res < (UINT32_MAX / 16)) ||\n         ((res == (UINT32_MAX / 16)) &&\n          ( (uint32_t) digit <= (UINT32_MAX % 16)) ) )\n    {\n      res *= 16;\n      res += (unsigned int) digit;\n    }\n    else\n      return 0;\n    str++;\n    digit = toxdigitvalue (*str);\n  }\n\n  if (str - start > 0)\n    *out_val = res;\n  return (size_t) (str - start);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (res < (UINT32_MAX / 16)) ||\n         ((res == (UINT32_MAX / 16)) &&\n          ( (uint32_t) digit <= (UINT32_MAX % 16)) ) )\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The conditional implements an overflow check using a two-part test joined by ||. The right-hand side is only evaluated when the left-hand side is false (short-circuit), and removing it would change the acceptance criteria (and thus program behaviour). There are no operations that are executed but redundant or removable without effect."
