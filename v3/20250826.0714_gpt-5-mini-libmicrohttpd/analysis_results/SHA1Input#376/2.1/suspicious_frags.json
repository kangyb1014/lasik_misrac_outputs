  "explanation": "I flagged all conditional blocks and the main processing loop because they are the control-flow points most likely to produce unreachable code or make other checks effectively unreachable in some call sequences: the early return when length == 0 causes the subsequent null-pointer check to be skipped for that input; the computed/corrupted checks contain returns and state mutations that affect later branches; the loop body contains nested overflow checks (length_low == 0 / length_high == 0) which depend on integer wrap and thus merit inspection for reachability and intent; and the message_block_index == 64 branch triggers an external processing function that affects loop state. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 because they are simple, directly reachable statements or necessary end-of-function returns: the final \"return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\" is reachable when the loop completes normally; the single-assignment and increments inside the loop are normal, reachable operations driven by the loop condition; and there are no literal unreachable statements (e.g. code after an unconditional return) outside the conditional branches already listed. Therefore I limited the reported fragments to the control-flow constructs and nested conditions that can cause or mask unreachable code paths and should be examined further."
