  "explanation": "No direct self-call to SHA1Input is present in this snippet (there is no occurrence of SHA1Input(...) inside its own body). There are no function pointers or callbacks visible in this code that could cause an indirect call back to SHA1Input. The only function call in the loop is SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(context); this call must be investigated to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call SHA1Input, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. All other statements are returns, assignments, integer/flag updates, or simple pointer increment operations and cannot create recursion by themselves, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
