  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies specifically to uses of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The provided code snippet contains no direct calls to any <string.h> functions anywhere else in the function, so those other lines (initial null checks, computed/corrupted flag checks, length_low/length_high updates, return statements, and the message_array++ increment) are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need to be investigated for this rule. The only fragment that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses related to string-library usage is the loop that writes into context->message_block and triggers SHA1ProcessMessageBlock \u2014 that loop (and the block that calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock) is reported above and should be inspected further (including the implementation of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock and the definitions/limits of message_block and message_block_index) to ensure no <string.h> functions are invoked in a way that can access beyond object bounds."
