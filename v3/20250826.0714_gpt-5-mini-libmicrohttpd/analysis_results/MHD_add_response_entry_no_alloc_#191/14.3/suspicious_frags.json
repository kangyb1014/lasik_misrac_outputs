  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies only to controlling expressions (conditions of if/while/for/do-while/switch). The remaining code contains no other control statements: the assignments to hdr->... members and the call to _MHD_insert_header_last are ordinary expressions/statements (not controlling expressions) and therefore not subject to this rule. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) or switch statements in the function body to consider. The final 'return true;' is not a controlling expression. Thus, apart from the listed items (which should be inspected, including potential macro expansions), no other fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
