The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                  enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                                  char *header,\n                                  size_t header_len,\n                                  char *content,\n                                  size_t content_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *hdr;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != header_len);\n  mhd_assert (0 != content_len);\n  if (NULL == (hdr = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header))))\n    return false;\n\n  hdr->header = header;\n  hdr->header_size = header_len;\n  hdr->value = content;\n  hdr->value_size = content_len;\n  hdr->kind = kind;\n  _MHD_insert_header_last (response, hdr);\n\n  return true; /* Success exit point */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nhdr->value_size = content_len;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment hdr->value_size = content_len; is not intrinsically dead. It initialises a struct member that is presumably used later when the header is processed; therefore, in the typical/expected codebase its removal would change program behaviour. It would only violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 if, across the whole project, hdr->value_size is never read or used (for example, if all consumers treat hdr->value as NUL-terminated strings or use some other field/metadata for length). In that specific situation removing the assignment would not affect behaviour and the line would be dead code."
