  "explanation": "No use of the C standard library function memcmp appears in the provided function. There are no string-comparison operations (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) nor any use of functions that would compare null-terminated strings. The function only asserts non-zero lengths, allocates and populates a header structure, assigns pointer and size fields, and inserts the header; it does not perform any memory or string comparisons that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no fragments in this code requiring investigation for that rule."
