  "explanation": "Direct recursion is not present: the function body does not contain a call to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ itself. The only function/macro calls in this fragment are mhd_assert, MHD_calloc_ and _MHD_insert_header_last; these are the only places where indirect recursion could originate, so they are reported. Other lines (local variable declarations, assignments to hdr->..., sizeof, return statements, and the function signature) are not function calls and cannot by themselves introduce indirect self-calls, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
