  "explanation": "The places flagged are the function parameters that are pointers to char and the assignments that store those pointers into the response header structure \u2014 these are the only locations where a pointer to character data is accepted and subsequently stored, so they need investigation to determine whether the pointed-to data could/should be const-qualified. Other fragments do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the 'response' parameter is used to modify the response object (so it must be non-const), the allocation and insertion (MHD_calloc_ and _MHD_insert_header_last) operate on newly allocated/owned structures and do not imply the pointed-to data should be const, numeric size parameters and enum 'kind' are non-pointer types, and simple assignments to size/kind fields and the return statement are unrelated to pointer const-qualification."
