  "explanation": "No direct uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the shown function. The code only performs assertions, calls to other functions (mhd_assert, gnutls_deinit, MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_ip_limit_del) and frees a pointer. The free is guarded by a NULL check (if (NULL != connection->addr) free(connection->addr);), so there is no immediate risk of out\u2011of\u2011bounds access due to a string operation here. The only pointer passed to another routine is connection->addr (with connection->addr_len) \u2014 if that other routine uses string.h functions incorrectly, it would need to be inspected within its own implementation, but that is outside the provided code fragment. Likewise, gnutls_deinit and the MHD_* helper functions are external; their internals would need review if suspected, but they are not present in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that directly violate or trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
