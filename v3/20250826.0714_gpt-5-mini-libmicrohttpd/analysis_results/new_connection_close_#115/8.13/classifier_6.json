  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "From the fragment alone this is not a definite violation. The assertion only compares connection->nextE to NULL; that use does not require the pointed-to type to be const. If, however, the member nextE is declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *nextE' and in the whole program it is only ever read (compared/dereferenced for reading) and never modified, then Rule 8.13 would be violated: the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (i.e. 'const struct MHD_Connection *nextE'). If nextE is intended to be updated (repointed) as part of a linked list, the current non-const declaration is appropriate and there is no violation."
