  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect self-calls, so only expressions that invoke other functions (or macros that expand to function calls) can introduce recursion. The fragments listed above cover all function-call sites and assertion macro uses present in this function and therefore are the only locations that need investigation for possible indirect recursion. Other parts of the code (function signature, preprocessor conditionals, pointer/member access expressions used in the assertions, opening/closing braces and simple NULL checks) do not perform function calls themselves and therefore cannot cause direct or indirect calls back into this function, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2 compliance."
