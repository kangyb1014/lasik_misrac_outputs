Specifically, I checked for and did not find: \u2022 GNU or compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __extension__, nested functions, labels-as-values, or other nonstandard keywords. \u2022 Inline assembly or compiler-specific pragmas. \u2022 GCC/Clang-specific constructs (statement-expression, typeof, __attribute__ ((...)), __asm__, etc.). \u2022 Use of nonstandard integer literal forms \u2014 the code uses the standard UINT64_C macro. \u2022 Any nonstandard cast or compound literal extensions. \u2022 Any use of C++-only syntax or other language-mixing constructs. The code uses standard C identifiers, stdint types (uint32_t, uint64_t), standard macros (UINT64_C), ordinary control flow, and comments (including a Doxygen-style /**< ... */ comment) \u2014 none of these are compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
