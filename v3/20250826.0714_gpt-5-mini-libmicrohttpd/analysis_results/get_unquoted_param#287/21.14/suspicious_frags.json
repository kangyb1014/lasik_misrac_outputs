  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function uses the Standard Library function memcmp, nor performs any direct memory comparisons of null-terminated strings. The function only: assigns pointers and lengths, checks flags and sizes, calls helper functions (get_buffer_for_size, MHD_str_unquote) and uses assertions. There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or similar string-comparison functions in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: implementations of the called helper functions are not shown; if those contain memcmp usage that compares null-terminated strings, they must be inspected separately, but that is outside the scope of this code fragment.)"
