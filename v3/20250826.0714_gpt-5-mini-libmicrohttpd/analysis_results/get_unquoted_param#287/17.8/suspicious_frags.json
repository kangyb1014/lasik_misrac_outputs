  "explanation": "I examined all statements in get_unquoted_param for modifications of function parameters (i.e., assigning to the parameter variables themselves). None of the parameter variables are assigned to or otherwise modified:\n\n- param is declared const and only read (param->value.str, param->value.len, param->quoted). No writes to param or to param->value occur.\n- tmp1 is an array parameter (adjusted to a char * parameter) and is only passed to get_buffer_for_size; tmp1 itself is not reassigned in this function. Writing into the buffer that tmp1 points to would be allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified), but no such writes occur here.\n- ptmp2 and ptmp2_size are pointer parameters passed to get_buffer_for_size; this function may modify the objects they point to (allowed), but there is no reassignment to ptmp2 or ptmp2_size themselves in this function.\n- unquoted is a pointer parameter; the code writes to the object it points to (unquoted->str, unquoted->len), which is explicitly permitted by the rule. The pointer variable unquoted is not reassigned.\n\nThere are no statements like param = ..., tmp1 = ..., ptmp2 = ..., ptmp2_size = ..., or unquoted = ... that would violate Rule 17.8. The assertions and function calls do not reassign parameter variables within this function. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for potential modification of function parameters."
