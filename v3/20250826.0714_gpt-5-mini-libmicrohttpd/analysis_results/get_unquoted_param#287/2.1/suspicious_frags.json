  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments in the function are straightforward sequential operations (assignment of unquoted->str/unquoted->len in the quoted branch, call to MHD_str_unquote, and the final return) and do not contain constant conditional expressions, unreachable statements after unconditional returns, or dead-code constructs that would on their face be unreachable. The function's control flow consists of two mutually exclusive paths (unquoted early return vs. quoted path) and explicit returns; no code exists after the final return. Therefore, aside from the listed items which affect or depend on control-flow/assumptions (assertions, the early return branch, and the NULL buffer handling/conditional return), there are no other places in this function that prima facie indicate unreachable code and so do not need investigation for Rule 2.1."
