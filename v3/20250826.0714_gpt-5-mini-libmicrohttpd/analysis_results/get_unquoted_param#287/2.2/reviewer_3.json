  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s argument is correct as stated but conditional. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in the build (for example it expands to ((void)0) when assertions are disabled), then the assertion statements in get_unquoted_param are executed no-ops whose removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 i.e. they are dead code and that would be a Rule 2.2 violation. Conversely, if mhd_assert has observable side-effects (logging, aborting, error handling), then those calls are not dead and there is no Rule 2.2 violation. In short: the report is correct for the no-op-assert scenario, but not universally true for all possible definitions of mhd_assert."
