  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided snippet. The code uses standard C constructs: preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#else/#endif), casts ((unsigned int)), an enum return type, function call/return, and macro identifiers. Although identifiers like _MHD_EXTERN or _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE may expand (in other translation units) to compiler-specific declarations (for example __attribute__ or __declspec), those extension tokens are not present in this fragment itself and therefore cannot be conclusively reported here. Similarly, there are no occurrences of known explicit extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, __asm, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... ; ({ ... })}), or other documented compiler-specific keywords in the shown code, so no fragments need investigation under Rule 1.2 based solely on this snippet."
