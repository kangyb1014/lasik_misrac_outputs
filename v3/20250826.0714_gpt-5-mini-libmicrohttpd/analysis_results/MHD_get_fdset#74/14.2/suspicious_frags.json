First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loop (or other loop) constructs are present in the provided code fragment. The function body consists solely of a call to MHD_get_fdset2 with a conditional (?:) expression as one parameter determined by preprocessor macros. There are no loop counters, no for-statement clauses to inspect, and no expressions that modify objects (assignments) in a loop clause. The ternary expression only reads members of daemon and a macro constant and does not introduce side effects relevant to Rule 14.2. Although the called function MHD_get_fdset2 could contain for-loops, that code is not present in the supplied fragment and therefore cannot be inspected here. For these reasons, there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
