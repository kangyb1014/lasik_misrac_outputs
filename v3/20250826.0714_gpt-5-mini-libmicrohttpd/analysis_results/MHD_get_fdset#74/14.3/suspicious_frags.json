  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, switch, for, while, do-while) are present in the provided function. The only conditional-like construct is the ternary expression guarded by the preprocessor macro: daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ? (unsigned)daemon->fdset_size : (unsigned)_MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE \u2014 this is not invariant because it depends on the runtime field daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app. The #ifdef/#else is a preprocessor directive, not a C-language controlling expression and thus not subject to Rule 14.3. There are no do-while loops with an integer constant expression, nor any apparent intentionally infinite loops. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this snippet."
