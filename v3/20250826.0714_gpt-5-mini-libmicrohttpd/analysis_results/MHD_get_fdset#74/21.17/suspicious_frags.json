  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code fragment. The function simply forwards its arguments to MHD_get_fdset2 and passes an unsigned int computed via conditional compilation; there are no calls to string handling functions, no buffer/array copies, and no pointer arithmetic or indexed accesses that would imply string operations. The conditional expression involving daemon->fdset_size only selects a size value and does not perform any memory/string operations. Therefore there are no code fragments within this snippet that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17. (Note: if MHD_get_fdset2 or other parts of the codebase use string.h functions, those separate locations should be inspected, but they are outside the provided fragment.)"
