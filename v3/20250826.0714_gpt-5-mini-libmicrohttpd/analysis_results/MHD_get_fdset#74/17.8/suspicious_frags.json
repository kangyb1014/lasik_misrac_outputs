  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies any of the function parameters themselves. Details:\n- The function parameter list (daemon, read_fd_set, write_fd_set, except_fd_set, max_fd) are only forwarded to MHD_get_fdset2; passing a parameter to another function does not modify the parameter.\n- The accesses daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size are read-only uses (no assignment), which is allowed: the rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer but forbids modifying the pointer itself \u2014 here neither occurs.\n- The ternary expression and the casts ((unsigned int) ...) compute a value for the extra argument but do not change any parameter.\n- The preprocessor conditional only selects which value to pass; it does not assign to or change any parameter.\n- There are no assignments to the pointer parameters (no statements like daemon = ..., read_fd_set = ..., *max_fd = ..., etc.) and no operations that rebind the pointer variables.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
