  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp appears in this translation unit. The code only checks options using a bitwise AND, initializes and forwards a va_list to daemon->custom_error_log, and calls that function pointer. There are no direct string comparisons (no strcmp, no memcmp) or uses of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings in the shown code. The only function that could possibly perform such a comparison is daemon->custom_error_log, but its implementation is not present in this snippet; that implementation should be inspected separately if required. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
