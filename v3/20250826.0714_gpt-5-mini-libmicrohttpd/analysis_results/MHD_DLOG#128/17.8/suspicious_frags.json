  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- The parameter daemon (const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon) is only dereferenced for reading (checking daemon->options and calling the function-pointer member). The pointer itself is not reassigned or modified; invoking a function via a member function-pointer does not modify the pointer parameter and the rule allows modification of the object pointed to (but not the pointer itself).\n- The parameter format (const char *format) is not modified; it is only passed to va_start and then forwarded to the custom_error_log call. va_start initializes the local va_list and does not alter the format parameter.\n- No assignment or increment/decrement operations target the parameters daemon or format.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this snippet."
