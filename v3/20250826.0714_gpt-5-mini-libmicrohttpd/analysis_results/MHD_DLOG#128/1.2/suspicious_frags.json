  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C features: a normal function definition (with a variadic parameter list '...'), va_list/va_start/va_end macros from <stdarg.h>, standard struct pointer access (daemon->...), a bitwise & operation and integer comparison, and a call through a function pointer stored in the struct. There are no compiler-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions, inline assembly, nonstandard keywords, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
