  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct as a potential MISRA 17.2 violation. MHD_DLOG performs an indirect call via the function pointer daemon->custom_error_log; if that pointer (at runtime) were set to MHD_DLOG (or to some other function that eventually calls MHD_DLOG) an indirect recursion would occur and that would contravene MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Note: from the snippet alone there is no static guarantee that custom_error_log cannot point back to MHD_DLOG (or be a wrapper that calls it), so the code as written allows the possibility of indirect self\u2011calls. It is also worth noting that in many implementations the function\u2011pointer type for custom_error_log likely differs (va_list vs varargs), so assigning MHD_DLOG to that pointer would be type\u2011incompatible without an explicit cast \u2014 but such casts or other assignments could still make the recursive scenario possible. The provided runtime log shows the pointer was different in that run, but that does not invalidate the potential violation."
