  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_pipe:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_pipe (int fd)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_callback (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN,\n                                                MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE,\n                                                &pipe_reader,\n                                                NULL,\n                                                &free_callback);\n  if (NULL == response)\n    return NULL;\n  response->fd = fd;\n  response->is_pipe = true;\n  response->crc_cls = response;\n  return response;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresponse->fd = fd;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated on the basis of the fragment alone. The assignment response->fd = fd cannot be proven to be dead from the shown code: it is required unless the fd member is never subsequently read or is overwritten before any read. It would only violate Rule 2.2 if, in the whole project, the fd field is never used (or always overwritten before use) \u2014 e.g. if response->fd is never referenced anywhere else, then this assignment would be dead code."
