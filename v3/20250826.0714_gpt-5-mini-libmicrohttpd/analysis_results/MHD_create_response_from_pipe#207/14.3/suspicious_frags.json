  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The only conditional is \"if (NULL == response)\", and this depends on the runtime return value of MHD_create_response_from_callback, so it is not an invariant. There are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) or other conditional expressions that evaluate to a compile-time constant. Assignments (response->fd = fd; response->is_pipe = true; response->crc_cls = response;) are not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this snippet."
