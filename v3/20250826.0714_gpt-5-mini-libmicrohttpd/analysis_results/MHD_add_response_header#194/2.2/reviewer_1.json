In normal operation hdr will be non-NULL, so the assertion is executed but has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour. Thus that assertion constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Other operations in the fragment \u2014 _MHD_remove_header and the frees \u2014 affect program state and are not dead.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Whether mhd_assert(NULL != hdr) is \u201cdead code\u201d cannot be established from the fragment alone because the semantics of mhd_assert are not given. There are two relevant possibilities: (1) If mhd_assert is a macro that expands to nothing (or is compiled out in release builds) then it is not executed at all, so it is not dead code under Rule 2.2 (note the rule applies to operations that are executed). (2) If mhd_assert is a runtime check that logs/aborts or otherwise has observable behaviour when the condition fails, then removing it could change program behaviour in the (admittedly erroneous) case where the invariant is violated. Even if the programmer believes hdr cannot be NULL, that does not prove the check has no effect in all executions of the project; such defensive assertions can alter behaviour in fault cases and are therefore not provably removable. In short, absent the definition of mhd_assert and the project-wide build configuration, you cannot conclude the assertion is dead code. Hence Agent A\u2019s claim is not justified."
