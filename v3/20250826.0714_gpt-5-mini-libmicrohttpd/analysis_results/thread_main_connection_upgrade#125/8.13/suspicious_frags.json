  "explanation": "I selected pointer-bearing declarations and all calls that pass or obtain pointers to internal structures (connection, urh, daemon, nested connection/mhd members, and functions that take those pointers) because these are locations where the pointee's const-qualification should be checked. Other code fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - fd_set variables (rs, ws, es) and their addresses are used as select() input/output sets and are modified by select and by the fdset helper routines, so they should not be const. - The pollfd array (p) is initialized and subsequently updated by local code and helper functions, so its elements must be modifiable. - The local timeval (tv) and its pointer (tvp) are modified/used as a timeout by select/poll and so must not be const. - Scalar variables (ints, bools, MHD_socket, etc.) are not pointers and are irrelevant to the pointer-to-const rule. - Macro uses (FD_ZERO, FD_SETSIZE) and system-call wrappers pass pointers where the callee is expected to modify the data; these are appropriate as non-const. Therefore, only the listed pointer declarations/usages warrant further review for possible const qualification under Rule 8.13."
