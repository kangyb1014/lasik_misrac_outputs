  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function for compiler-specific language extensions. I did not find any of the following explicit compiler extensions that would need investigation (each item checked and not present):\n- GCC/MSVC-specific keywords or builtins such as __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, __asm, typeof, __extension__, statement-expressions ({ ... }) (GNU), or asm(...).\n- Inline assembly or compiler intrinsics.\n- Vendor-specific storage-class or function modifiers (e.g. __forceinline, __inline__ with vendor extensions).\n- Compiler-specific pragmas or #pragma with vendor identifiers.\n- Microsoft-specific constructs (e.g. __fastcall) or other non-standard keywords.\n\nOther constructs present are standard C or standard system APIs and do not constitute compiler language extensions:\n- Preprocessor conditional compilation (#ifdef / #endif) and the use of a backslash for physical-line continuation are part of standard C preprocessing, not compiler extensions.\n- Use of bool (C99 stdbool.h) and standard declarations (structs, local variables, casts) are standard C, not extensions.\n- Use of POSIX functions/macros (select, poll, fd_set, timeval, memset, etc.) are library/API/platform features, not compiler language extensions covered by MISRA C Rule 1.2.\n- Macros such as MHD_SYS_select_, MHD_D_IS_USING_SELECT_, etc., may wrap platform behavior but are plain macros and not inherently compiler language extensions.\n\nBecause no explicit compiler language extensions (as documented by compilers) appear in this code fragment, there are no suspicious code fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
