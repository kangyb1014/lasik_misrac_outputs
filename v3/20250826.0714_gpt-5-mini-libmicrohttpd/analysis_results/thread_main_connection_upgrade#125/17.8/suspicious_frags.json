  "explanation": "I inspected thread_main_connection_upgrade for any modification of the function parameter 'con' (assignments to the parameter itself, increments/decrements, reassignments to NULL, or passing its address to allow modification). No occurrences were found: the code only dereferences con (con->urh, con->daemon, con->tid, con->tls_read_ready) or passes con by value to MHD_connection_finish_forward_(con). Local pointers (urh, daemon) are initialized from con and may be modified, but they are local variables (not function parameters) and therefore not subject to MISRA C Rule 17.8. Calls within the function may modify the object pointed to by con (which is permitted), but the pointer parameter itself is never reassigned. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
