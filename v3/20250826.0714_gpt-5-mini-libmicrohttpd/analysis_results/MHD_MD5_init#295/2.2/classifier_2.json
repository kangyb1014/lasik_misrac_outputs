  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_MD5_init:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_MD5_init (struct Md5Ctx *ctx)\n{\n  /* Initial hash values, see RFC 1321, Clause 3.3 (step 3). */\n  /* Note: values specified in RFC by bytes and should be loaded in\n           little-endian mode, therefore hash values here are initialised with\n           original bytes used in little-endian order. */\n  ctx->H[0] = UINT32_C (0x67452301);\n  ctx->H[1] = UINT32_C (0xefcdab89);\n  ctx->H[2] = UINT32_C (0x98badcfe);\n  ctx->H[3] = UINT32_C (0x10325476);\n\n  /* Initialise the number of bytes. */\n  ctx->count = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  ctx->count = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the statement ctx->count = 0 is an initialization in MHD_MD5_init and not dead code. Removing it would change behaviour (count could remain uninitialised or retain a stale value), so it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. It would only be a violation if it were provably redundant (e.g. ctx->count is guaranteed zero-initialised elsewhere or always overwritten before use), which is not shown here."
