Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_MD5_init:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_MD5_init (struct Md5Ctx *ctx)\n{\n  /* Initial hash values, see RFC 1321, Clause 3.3 (step 3). */\n  /* Note: values specified in RFC by bytes and should be loaded in\n           little-endian mode, therefore hash values here are initialised with\n           original bytes used in little-endian order. */\n  ctx->H[0] = UINT32_C (0x67452301);\n  ctx->H[1] = UINT32_C (0xefcdab89);\n  ctx->H[2] = UINT32_C (0x98badcfe);\n  ctx->H[3] = UINT32_C (0x10325476);\n\n  /* Initialise the number of bytes. */\n  ctx->count = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  ctx->H[0] = UINT32_C (0x67452301);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement ctx->H[0] = UINT32_C(0x67452301); initializes the MD5 internal state (H[0]) as required by RFC 1321. It is executed by MHD_MD5_init and is used by subsequent MD5 processing; removing it would change the algorithm's output and therefore program behaviour. Hence this assignment is not dead code (it is a necessary initialization of the hash state)."
