  "explanation": "The provided function contains a simple sequence of four assignments to ctx->H[0..3] followed by an assignment to ctx->count and no conditional statements, labels, loops, multiple returns, goto statements, or other control-flow constructs that could produce unreachable code. The comments are non-executable. The UINT32_C(...) tokens are integer constant macros and do not introduce unreachable code when expanded. There is no code after a return or other terminating statement, no duplicated or mutually exclusive branches, and no dead labels. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that appear to be unreachable and nothing in this snippet requires further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. (Note: this assessment is limited to the supplied function; interactions with other translation units or macro definitions outside this snippet are not present and thus not relevant to reachability here.)"
