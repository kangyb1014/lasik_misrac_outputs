  "explanation": "No code in this function invokes any of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) nor any other string-handling routine. The function only performs scalar assignments to members of the provided struct pointer (ctx->H[0..3] and ctx->count). There are no pointer-based buffer operations, no array indexing beyond the fixed H[0..3] elements shown, and no calls that take pointer parameters into which string functions could write or read. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses related to the use of <string.h> functions and nothing here needs further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
