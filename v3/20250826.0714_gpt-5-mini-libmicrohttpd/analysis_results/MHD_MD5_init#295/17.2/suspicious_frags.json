  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls). Explanation: \n- The function body contains only assignments to members of the ctx structure and an integer constant macro. There are no function calls at all (neither to MHD_MD5_init nor to any other function).\n- The UINT32_C tokens are macros that expand to integer constant literals (compile-time constant suffixes), not function calls, so they cannot introduce recursion.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences or calls via members of ctx that could create indirect recursion.\n- No callbacks, no other functions invoked, and no use of constructs (like setjmp/longjmp or threads) that could cause indirect re-entry. \nTherefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 in the provided code."
