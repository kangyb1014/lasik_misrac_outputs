  "explanation": "The function body consists solely of a single return that forwards to MHD_run_from_select2; the only executed decision in this code is the selection of the fdset_size argument. The suspicious fragments above cover: the entire return call (so the wrapper and its argument selection are inspected), the ternary expression that selects between daemon->fdset_size and the default, the explicit default value, and the preprocessor block that causes different compiled variants. Other parts of the snippet \u2014 the function signature, parameter declarations, opening/closing braces, and the declaration specifier (_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result) \u2014 are just declarations or syntactic structure and do not perform operations that could be dead code. There is no other executed code in this function to inspect for dead-code removal impact, and unreachable code (none present here) is excluded by the rule notes. Therefore only the listed fragments need investigation for potential dead-code issues (for example if the runtime flag is constant across the project or if compile-time configuration always selects one branch)."
