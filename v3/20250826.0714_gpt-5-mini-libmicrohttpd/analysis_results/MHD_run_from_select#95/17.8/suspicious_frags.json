  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies any of its parameters. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers (daemon, read_fd_set, write_fd_set, except_fd_set), so the pointer parameters themselves are not altered.\n- The fd_set pointers are declared as const, so they cannot be used to modify the objects they point to within this function.\n- The only use of daemon is to read its members (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size) in the ternary expression; reading the object pointed to is permitted (the rule forbids modifying the parameter itself, not accessing the pointee).\n- The parameters are then forwarded to MHD_run_from_select2; passing a pointer as an argument does not modify the parameter in this function.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
