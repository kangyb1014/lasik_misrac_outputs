  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined the code for compiler/language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, MSVC __declspec, pragma extension usage, inline asm, nonstandard keywords, or other compiler-specific language features). None of those constructs appear in the provided function.\n\nNotes on items that might look suspicious but are NOT language extensions and thus do not need investigation under MISRA C: \n- #if, #ifdef, #else, #endif and the use of macros such as MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, HTTPS_SUPPORT, etc. are standard preprocessor directives (not extensions).\n- Calls to platform/library APIs (WSAStartup, gcry_control, gcry_check_version, gnutls_global_init, MHD_PANIC, MHD_set_panic_func, etc.) are library/platform usages, not compiler-language extensions.\n- MAKEWORD, LOBYTE, HIBYTE are platform (Windows) macros \u2014 platform-specific but not compiler language extensions per se; they are defined in Windows headers.\n- The backslash used to split the string literal across source lines is the standard C line-continuation mechanism / adjacent-string literal behavior, not a compiler extension.\n- Use of standard types like uint64_t and struct timeval are standard C / POSIX types (or from standard headers) and not compiler extensions.\n- Conditional compilation based on version-number macros (GCRYPT_VERSION_NUMBER, GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER) is normal portable/version-check code.\n\nBecause no explicit compiler language extensions were detected in the code fragment, there are no suspicious fragments to flag for Rule 1.2."
