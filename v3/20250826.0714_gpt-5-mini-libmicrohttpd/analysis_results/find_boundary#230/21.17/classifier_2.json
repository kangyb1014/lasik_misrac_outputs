  "scenario": "The call memchr(buf, '-', pp->buffer_pos) reads up to pp->buffer_pos bytes starting at buf which is set to (char *)&pp[1]. This is safe provided the memory for the buffer is actually allocated immediately after the struct and pp->buffer_pos does not exceed the allocated buffer size (pp->buffer_size). In the surrounding code there are checks that use pp->buffer_pos and that memcmp reads only 2 + blen bytes after buf; the memchr call itself uses the recorded filled length pp->buffer_pos. The rule would be violated only if that invariant is broken (e.g. pp->buffer_pos > actual allocated buffer memory or buf does not point to that buffer)."
