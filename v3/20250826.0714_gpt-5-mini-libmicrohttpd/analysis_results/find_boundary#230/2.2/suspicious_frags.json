  "explanation": "I have flagged the commented-out increment and multiple assignments / pointer/index updates in the function for further investigation with respect to Rule 2.2 (dead code). Other parts of the function were not flagged because they are clearly active control-flow and safety operations that affect program behaviour and hence are unlikely to be dead code: the buffer-size check (if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen) { ... return MHD_NO; }) prevents out-of-bounds access; the memcmp checks determine whether a boundary is present and are essential to branching; the call to memchr and the surrounding logic are used to decide how far to advance the offset; the initial computation of buf (char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];) is used throughout the routine; and the return statements (return MHD_NO / return MHD_YES) are the function's observable outputs. Those constructs directly affect control flow or outputs and therefore do not look like dead code and do not need investigation under Rule 2.2."
