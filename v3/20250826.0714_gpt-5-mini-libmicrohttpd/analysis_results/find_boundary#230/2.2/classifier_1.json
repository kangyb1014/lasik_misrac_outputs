  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of find_boundary:\n```c\nstatic int\nfind_boundary (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n               const char *boundary,\n               size_t blen,\n               size_t *ioffptr,\n               enum PP_State next_state,\n               enum PP_State next_dash_state)\n{\n  char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  const char *dash;\n\n  if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen)\n  {\n    if (pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size)\n      pp->state = PP_Error;     /* out of memory */\n    /* ++(*ioffptr); */\n    return MHD_NO;              /* not enough data */\n  }\n  if ( (0 != memcmp (\"--\",\n                     buf,\n                     2)) ||\n       (0 != memcmp (&buf[2],\n                     boundary,\n                     blen)))\n  {\n    if (pp->state != PP_Init)\n    {\n      /* garbage not allowed */\n      pp->state = PP_Error;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      /* skip over garbage (RFC 2046, 5.1.1) */\n      dash = memchr (buf,\n                     '-',\n                     pp->buffer_pos);\n      if (NULL == dash)\n        (*ioffptr) += pp->buffer_pos;         /* skip entire buffer */\n      else if (dash == buf)\n        (*ioffptr)++;                         /* at least skip one byte */\n      else\n        (*ioffptr) += (size_t) (dash - buf);  /* skip to first possible boundary */\n    }\n    return MHD_NO;                            /* expected boundary */\n  }\n  /* remove boundary from buffer */\n  (*ioffptr) += 2 + blen;\n  /* next: start with headers */\n  pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash;\n  pp->state = next_state;\n  pp->dash_state = next_dash_state;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(*ioffptr) += 2 + blen;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The statement (*ioffptr) += 2 + blen; advances the byte-offset past the detected boundary so subsequent processing sees the correct data. If this operation were removed the offset would not be updated, changing program behaviour (e.g. reprocessing the same bytes, misparsing or looping), so the operation is not dead code."
