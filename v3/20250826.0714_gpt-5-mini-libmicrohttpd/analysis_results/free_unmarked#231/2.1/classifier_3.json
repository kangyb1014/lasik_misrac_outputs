  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-body is executed when pp->content_type is non-NULL and the NE_content_type bit is not set in pp->have, so the code is reachable at runtime depending on program state. There is no compile-time constant expression here that makes the condition always false or true, so the block is not unreachable. (Only a hypothetical project-level situation \u2014 e.g. if analysis proved pp->content_type is always NULL at this point or the condition is reduced by preprocessing/constant folding to a constant false \u2014 would make the body unreachable, but no such evidence is present in the fragment.)"
