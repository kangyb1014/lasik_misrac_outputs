  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any other function that compares null-terminated strings is present in the provided code. The function only performs pointer NULL checks, bitmask flag checks (pp->have & NE_...), calls free on allocated pointers, and sets pointers to NULL. There are no string-comparison calls (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) and no raw memory comparisons of C strings. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 21.14."
