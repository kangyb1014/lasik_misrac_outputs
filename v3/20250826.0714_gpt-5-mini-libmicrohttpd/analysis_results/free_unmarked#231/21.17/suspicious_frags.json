  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The code only performs NULL checks, bitmask checks on pp->have, calls free(), and assigns NULL to pointers. There is no pointer arithmetic, no buffer access, and no use of string-handling functions that could read or write beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
