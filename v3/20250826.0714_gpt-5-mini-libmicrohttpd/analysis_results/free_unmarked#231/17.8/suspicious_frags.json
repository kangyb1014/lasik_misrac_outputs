  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter pp itself. All modifications are to the object pointed to by pp (pp->content_name, pp->content_type, pp->content_filename, pp->content_transfer_encoding), which is allowed by Rule 17.8. There are no assignments to pp, no increments/decrements, and pp is not passed by value to any function that would change the pointer variable. Calls to free() operate on members of the pointed-to object and the subsequent assignments set those members to NULL \u2014 these modify the pointee, not the pointer parameter. Therefore no fragments need investigation under Rule 17.8."
