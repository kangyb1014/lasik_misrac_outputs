  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer pp->content_filename is being used to manage (free and reset) heap-owned storage so it must be a pointer to mutable storage; therefore it cannot be const-qualified. A violation of Rule 8.13 would occur if the object pointed to is not actually modified or owned (e.g. always treated as read-only or initialized from string literals) and the pointer is declared as a non-const char * when it could be const char * \u2014 in that case the pointer type should be changed to point to a const-qualified type."
