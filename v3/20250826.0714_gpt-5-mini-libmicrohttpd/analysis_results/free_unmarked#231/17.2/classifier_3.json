  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the presented code. The call free(pp->content_filename) invokes the standard library function free, not free_unmarked, so free_unmarked does not call itself directly or indirectly. (A hypothetical violation scenario would be if free were redefined to call free_unmarked \u2014 for example via a macro like #define free free_unmarked or an implementation hook where free() ultimately calls free_unmarked \u2014 which would make free_unmarked indirectly call itself and thus violate Rule 17.2.)"
