  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp is present in the shown function. All other string handling in this fragment is length-aware (uses explicit length fields like nc_param->value.len and val_len) or single-character checks (e.g. using val[0] stored in 'f' and range comparisons). The local buffer 'unq' is used together with an explicit returned length. There are no occurrences of memcmp or any obvious comparisons of null-terminated strings performed with memcmp in the rest of the code fragment, so those statements do not require investigation for Rule 21.14. The only places in this fragment that could hide a memcmp usage are the external/helper function calls listed in suspicious_frags; all other lines are safe with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
