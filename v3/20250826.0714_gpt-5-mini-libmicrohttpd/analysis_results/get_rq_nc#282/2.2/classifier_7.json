  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_rq_nc:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_GetRqNCResult\nget_rq_nc (const struct MHD_RqDAuth *params,\n           uint32_t *nc)\n{\n  const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *const nc_param =\n    &params->nc;\n  char unq[16];\n  const char *val;\n  size_t val_len;\n  size_t res;\n  uint64_t nc_val;\n\n  if (NULL == nc_param->value.str)\n    return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_NONE;\n\n  if (0 == nc_param->value.len)\n    return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_BROKEN;\n\n  if (! nc_param->quoted)\n  {\n    val = nc_param->value.str;\n    val_len = nc_param->value.len;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    /* Actually no backslashes must be used in 'nc' */\n    if (sizeof(unq) < params->nc.value.len)\n      return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_TOO_LONG;\n    val_len = MHD_str_unquote (nc_param->value.str, nc_param->value.len, unq);\n    if (0 == val_len)\n      return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_BROKEN;\n    val = unq;\n  }\n\n  res = MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (val, val_len, &nc_val);\n  if (0 == res)\n  {\n    const char f = val[0];\n    if ( (('9' >= f) && ('0' <= f)) ||\n         (('F' >= f) && ('A' <= f)) ||\n         (('a' <= f) && ('f' >= f)) )\n      return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_TOO_LARGE;\n    else\n      return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_BROKEN;\n  }\n  if (val_len != res)\n    return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_BROKEN;\n  if (UINT32_MAX < nc_val)\n    return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_TOO_LARGE;\n  *nc = (uint32_t) nc_val;\n  return MHD_GET_RQ_NC_VALID;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconst struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *const nc_param =\n    &params->nc;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the pointer nc_param is subsequently used (nc_param->value.str, nc_param->value.len, nc_param->quoted, etc.), so the initialization affects program behaviour. A violation would occur if the variable were assigned but never referenced (i.e. the assignment and declaration had no effect), which would be dead code under Rule 2.2."
