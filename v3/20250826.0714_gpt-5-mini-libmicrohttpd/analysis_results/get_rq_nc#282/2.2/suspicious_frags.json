  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that could plausibly contain dead or redundant operations and therefore merit investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other parts of the function (variable declarations not listed, single-use assignments and the overall control-flow structure) should not be further investigated for dead code because: each declared variable (val, val_len, res, nc_val) is subsequently used; the early return checks (NULL/zero-length) affect control flow and prevent undefined behaviour; the conversion call and subsequent checks determine return values and the final assignment to *nc is used by the caller. There are no other obvious assignments or operations that are never read or whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
