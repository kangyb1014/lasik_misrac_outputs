Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining text in the function (the function signature, opening/closing braces, blank lines and the comment after the #endif) are structural or declarative and cannot by themselves constitute executed dead code. The suspicious fragments listed are the only places where executed operations (assertions, conditional early return under an optional compile-time flag, and the final arithmetic return) occur; each of these can be present or absent in different build configurations or may have no effect on observable behavior (e.g. asserts compiled out, conditional block compiled in/out), so they warrant investigation for Rule 2.2. There are no other executable statements or side-effecting expressions in the function that need investigation."
