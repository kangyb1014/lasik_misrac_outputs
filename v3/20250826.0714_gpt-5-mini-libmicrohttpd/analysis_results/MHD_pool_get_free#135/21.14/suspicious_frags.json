  "explanation": "I examined the provided function body. It contains only pointer/size arithmetic, assertions, macro uses (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE, _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE) and a size_t return. There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp or other standard-library string comparison functions, and there are no char pointers or null-terminated string operations in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). No further investigation of other fragments in this function is needed."
