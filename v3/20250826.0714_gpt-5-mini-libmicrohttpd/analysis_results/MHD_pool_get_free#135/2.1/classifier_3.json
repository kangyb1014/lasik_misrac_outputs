  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call mhd_assert(pool->end >= pool->pos) is executed whenever MHD_pool_get_free is invoked. If mhd_assert is defined to expand to nothing in some build configurations it is removed by preprocessing (not unreachable code). This statement would only be unreachable if it were placed after an unconditional return or guarded by a constant false condition, which is not the case here."
