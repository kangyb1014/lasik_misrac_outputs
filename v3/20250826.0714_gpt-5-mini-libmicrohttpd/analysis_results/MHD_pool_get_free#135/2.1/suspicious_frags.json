  "explanation": "I flagged the assertions, the ASAN conditional block (including its inner if/return), and the final return because these are the only places in the function where control flow could be rendered unreachable depending on build configuration or macro expansion. Other fragments in the function (the function signature, opening/closing braces and simple arithmetic expressions not already listed) are straightforward, syntactically necessary, and do not introduce additional unreachable paths, so they need not be investigated for Rule 2.1."
