  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement is a runtime assertion (mhd_assert) and does not itself create unreachable code. It does not alter control flow in normal builds, so Rule 2.1 is not violated. (Only a hypothetical violation would occur if mhd_assert were defined so that it unconditionally aborts or enters an infinite loop regardless of the condition, or if preprocessing removed subsequent code, but nothing in the fragment indicates that.)"
