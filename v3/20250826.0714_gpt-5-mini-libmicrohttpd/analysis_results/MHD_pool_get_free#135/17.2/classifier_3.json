  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement calls mhd_assert and ROUND_TO_ALIGN with pool->pos; neither is shown calling MHD_pool_get_free, so there is no direct or indirect recursion. A violation would only occur if either mhd_assert or ROUND_TO_ALIGN expanded/implemented to call MHD_pool_get_free (or call another routine that eventually calls it). For example, if ROUND_TO_ALIGN(x) were implemented as a function that (directly or indirectly) invoked MHD_pool_get_free, that would create an indirect self-call and violate Rule 17.2."
