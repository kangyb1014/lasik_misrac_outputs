  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (conditions used by if/while/do/for and similar constructs). The items above are the only places in the function that introduce controlling expressions or checks that may expand to controlling code: the three mhd_assert(...) invocations (which typically expand into conditional checks) and the explicit if (...) return 0; inside the MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE block. Other fragments in the function do not contain controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: the function signature, return statement that yields a computed value, the arithmetic expressions computing sizes, and the preprocessor #ifdef/#endif directives themselves (preprocessor conditionals are not runtime controlling expressions covered by this rule)."
