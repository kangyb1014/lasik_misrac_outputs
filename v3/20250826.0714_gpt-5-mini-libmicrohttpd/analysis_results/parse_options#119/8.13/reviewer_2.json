If the function does not modify *params, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (const struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params). As written this violates Rule 8.13 unless the implementation or callees actually modify the pointee; to fix, change the parameter (and the called parse_options_va prototype) to const if no modification occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s point is a valid style/const-correctness suggestion, but the report as stated is not definitively correct given only the shown code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed encourages pointer parameters to be const-qualified when possible (i.e. when the function and its callees do not modify the pointee). However, parse_options merely forwards the pointer to parse_options_va; whether the pointer can be made const depends on the whole call chain and the signature/behavior of parse_options_va (and any other callees). If parse_options_va (or further callees) modify *params or its prototype requires a non-const pointer, then the non-const parameter in parse_options is required and there is no violation. If neither parse_options_va nor any callee modifies the pointee and its prototype can be changed to take a const pointer, then both prototypes should be made const to satisfy Rule 8.13. With only the snippet shown, you cannot conclude a MISRA violation, so the agent\u2019s claim is not definitely correct."
