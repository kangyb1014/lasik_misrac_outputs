  "scenario": "The fragment alone (the call ret = parse_options_va(daemon, params, ap);) does not itself violate Rule 8.13. The rule concerns pointer types in declarations/definitions: pointers should be to const-qualified types where the pointed-to object is not modified. A concrete violation would be if parse_options_va is declared/defined as parse_options_va(struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, ...) but the function does not modify *daemon \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared as const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, and both that declaration and any non-const parameter in the caller (parse_options) would violate Rule 8.13. With only the call site shown, we cannot determine whether parse_options_va\u2019s prototype/definition omits const and thus cannot assert a violation from this fragment alone."
