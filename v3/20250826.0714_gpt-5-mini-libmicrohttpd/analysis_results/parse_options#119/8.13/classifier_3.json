  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment passes a va_list variable (ap) by value to parse_options_va. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that should be const-qualified where possible; this fragment does not show a pointer to a non-const type. The va_list is not a pointer-to-object that should be const here. (A concrete violation would be if the call supplied a pointer parameter of type T * where the function does not modify the pointed-to object but the pointer was not declared as const T *.)"
