True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function takes a non-const pointer parameter 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' but neither this function nor the shown code path modifies *daemon (it merely forwards the pointer to parse_options_va). If parse_options_va also does not modify the pointed object, the parameter should be 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'. Hence this fragment violates Rule 8.13. (If parse_options_va requires a non-const pointer because it modifies the object, then the non-const here would be justified.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In the shown parse_options implementation the function does not itself modify *daemon (it just forwards the pointer to parse_options_va), so making the parameter const would be appropriate \u2014 but only if the forwarded call chain and API also do not require modification.\n\nThe agent's claim is therefore conditional: it is correct only if parse_options_va (and any downstream code) also do not modify the object and its prototype can be changed to accept const. From the provided fragment alone there is no evidence that parse_options_va does not modify the daemon, nor is its prototype shown. Consequently you cannot conclusively say there is a MISRA violation based solely on this snippet. The correct action is to inspect parse_options_va and the overall API: if none of the callees modify the daemon, change the parameter types to const; if some callee modifies the object, the non-const parameter is justified.\n\nSo the agent's report is plausible but not proven by the code shown \u2014 it is not a definite MISRA 8.13 violation without further context."
