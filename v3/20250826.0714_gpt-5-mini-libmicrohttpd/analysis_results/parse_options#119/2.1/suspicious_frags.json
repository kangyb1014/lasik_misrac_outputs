  "explanation": "No other fragments in this snippet need investigation for unreachable-code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1). Every statement in the normal control flow of this function is reachable: variables are declared at function entry, va_start is called, parse_options_va is invoked, and then va_end and the returning of ret follow. There is no code after an unconditional return, no conditional compilation or labeled code making parts unreachable, and no obvious dead code constructs within this snippet. The items listed above are flagged because they are the points that could be unreachable only in broader contexts: the whole function may be unreachable if the static function is never referenced in the project, and the va_end/return statements could be bypassed if parse_options_va does not return (e.g. longjmp/exit). Those broader-project concerns are why those fragments are presented for further investigation; all other lines in the snippet do not exhibit unreachable-code issues and therefore do not need further review for Rule 2.1."
