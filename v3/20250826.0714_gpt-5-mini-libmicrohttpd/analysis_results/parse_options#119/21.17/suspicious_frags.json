  "explanation": "No code in the provided fragment uses any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The body only declares a va_list, uses va_start/va_end and forwards the va_list to parse_options_va; there is no buffer access, no pointer arithmetic, and no direct string handling in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: the callee parse_options_va is invoked but its implementation is not part of this fragment \u2014 if that implementation uses string.h functions, it should be inspected separately.)"
