  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any string-comparison operation is present in the provided code fragment. The function only uses va_list macros (va_start, va_end) and calls parse_options_va(daemon, params, ap). There are no char* manipulations, no calls to standard library comparison functions, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings in this snippet. The only call that might perform such a comparison is parse_options_va, but its implementation is not part of the provided code and therefore cannot be flagged here. Consequently, there are no fragments in the given code that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
