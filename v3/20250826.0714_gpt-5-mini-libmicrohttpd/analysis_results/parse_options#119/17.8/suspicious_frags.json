  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. In this function: (1) there are no assignments to the parameters 'daemon' or 'params' (no statements like daemon = ..., params = ...), and no increments/decrements or address writes that would modify the pointer values. (2) va_start(ap, params) initializes the local va_list 'ap' and does not modify the parameter 'params' (it only uses it to locate the start of the variable arguments). (3) Passing 'daemon' and 'params' to parse_options_va(daemon, params, ap) passes the pointer values by value; that call may modify the pointees (allowed) or modify its own local parameter variables, but such modifications would occur inside parse_options_va, not inside this function. Therefore, within parse_options there is no modification of function parameters and no MISRA Rule 17.8 concern to investigate here. If further verification is desired, inspect the implementation of parse_options_va to ensure it does not modify pointer parameters themselves (reassign them) rather than only their pointees."
