  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function takes &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex and passes it to a lock routine, which requires a mutable mutex object; the pointer must therefore be to a non-const struct so that the mutex member can be modified. Rule 8.13 recommends const-qualified pointers when possible, but in this case the pointed-to object (the mutex) is modified, so a non-const pointer is appropriate."
