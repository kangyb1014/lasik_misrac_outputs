Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Do not investigate the call to MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex); because it performs synchronization (observable side-effects) and removing it would alter program behaviour. The preprocessor conditional lines (#if / #else / #endif) are compile-time directives, not runtime operations to be considered dead code by Rule 2.2. The function signature/definition itself (static void MHD_ip_count_lock(...)) is not automatically dead \u2014 determining that would require whole-program call\u2011graph analysis (a static function may be referenced elsewhere), so it is not flagged here. No other lines in the provided fragment are plain no-op operations whose removal would be behaviourally neutral."
