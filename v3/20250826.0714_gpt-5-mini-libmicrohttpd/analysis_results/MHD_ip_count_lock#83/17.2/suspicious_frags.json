  "explanation": "The function contains no direct self-call. The only places that could introduce direct or indirect recursion are the function-call expressions listed above; each should be investigated to determine whether they (or macros they expand to) call MHD_ip_count_lock, directly or indirectly. Other fragments \u2014 the function signature, preprocessor conditional, the (void) daemon; cast in the #else branch, and the surrounding braces \u2014 do not perform function calls and therefore cannot introduce recursion and need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
