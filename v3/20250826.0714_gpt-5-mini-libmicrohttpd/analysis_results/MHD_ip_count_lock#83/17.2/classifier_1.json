  "scenario": "The function MHD_ip_count_lock calls MHD_mutex_lock_chk_. This is not a self-call and therefore does not violate Rule 17.2. A violation would only occur if MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (or something it calls) directly or indirectly called MHD_ip_count_lock; there is no evidence of that in the provided code fragment."
