  "explanation": "No calls to any of the Standard Library string handling functions from <string.h> are present in the provided code fragment. The code contains calls to gettimeofday, fprintf, free and uses an array index small_deltas[delta], pointer dereference of *req_cls to obtain a struct timeval, and integer arithmetic; none invoke memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn (or other <string.h> functions) that could cause accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by pointer parameters. Therefore Rule 21.17 (use of <string.h> functions) has no direct applicability here and there are no fragments to investigate for that rule. Note: the array indexing small_deltas[delta] and similar bounds concerns are relevant to other MISRA rules about array bounds and integer conversions, but they are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and so are not included as suspicious fragments for this specific rule."
