  "explanation": "I identified the only pointer-related declarations/uses in this function that could be candidates for const-qualification: the function parameter declarations and the local pointer initialization. No other pointer declarations appear in the function. The remaining code items are not relevant to Rule 8.13: tve is a non-pointer automatic structure used as an output for gettimeofday (so it must be writable), delta is an integer, SMALL and small_deltas are array/constant usages (indexing/modifying an array element requires a non-const object), fprintf and gettimeofday are library calls whose parameter types dictate mutability, and free() deallocates memory (which does not imply additional const-qualification of other variables). Therefore, aside from the reported fragments, there are no other pointers in this function that should be investigated for possible const-qualification under MISRA C Rule 8.13."
