Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other statements implement essential control flow or state updates and are not candidates for dead-code removal: the two early returns (return tmp1; return *ptmp2;) select the appropriate buffer based on required_size and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the bounds check against _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE guards invalid requests; the conditional free and subsequent malloc perform required memory management and their presence or absence affects program state and resource usage; updating *ptmp2_size after allocation reflects the new buffer state; the NULL checks and assignments are functional (not redundant) and influence subsequent behaviour. Therefore those fragments need not be investigated for dead code under Rule 2.2."
