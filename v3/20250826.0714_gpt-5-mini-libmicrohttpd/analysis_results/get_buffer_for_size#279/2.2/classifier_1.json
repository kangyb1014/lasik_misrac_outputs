  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_buffer_for_size:\n```c\nstatic char *\nget_buffer_for_size (char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                     char **ptmp2,\n                     size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                     size_t required_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || \\\n              (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size));\n\n  if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n    return tmp1;\n\n  if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n    return *ptmp2;\n\n  if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL != *ptmp2)\n    free (*ptmp2);\n  *ptmp2 = (char *) malloc (required_size);\n  if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n    *ptmp2_size = 0;\n  else\n    *ptmp2_size = required_size;\n  return *ptmp2;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The line is an assertion (mhd_assert) used to check an invariant. Assertions either perform a runtime check (and may terminate the program when the invariant fails) or are compiled out entirely in release builds. Removing the assertion could change program behaviour if the invariant ever fails (the assertion might abort or log); if it is compiled out it is not executed at all, so it is not \"dead code\" per Rule 2.2. Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
