  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The assertion mhd_assert((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size)); does not itself introduce unreachable code: it only documents an intended invariant and (typically) expands to a check that aborts or is compiled out. The remainder of get_buffer_for_size is reachable and uses both branches of the invariant. A violation would only occur in a different setup \u2014 for example if mhd_assert were defined to unconditionally abort or to unconditionally return (making all following code unreachable), or if the expression were a compile-time constant that made subsequent branches impossible. In the provided code as written, no unreachable code is introduced by this assertion."
