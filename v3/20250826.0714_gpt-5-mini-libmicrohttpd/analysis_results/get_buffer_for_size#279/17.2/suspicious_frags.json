  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are simple conditionals, pointer/size checks, returns and assignments which cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion by themselves. The only places where execution transfers to other functions/macros are the five fragments listed above (three mhd_assert calls, free and malloc). There are no function-pointer calls, no callbacks, and the function does not call itself. Therefore only the listed function-call or macro-call sites merit investigation for possible indirect recursion (e.g. if a macro expands into a call chain that could reach get_buffer_for_size); the remaining code does not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 compliance."
