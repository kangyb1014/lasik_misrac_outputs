  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s literal reading of Rule 2.2 is technically correct: the expression-statement \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d is a no-op whose removal would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour, so it fits the plain-language definition of \"dead code\". However, this is a pedantic interpretation and contrary to the intent and common application of MISRA in practice. The (void)param; idiom is an explicit, documented way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. MISRA\u2019s objective with Rule 2.2 is to eliminate code that is redundant in the program\u2019s logic or hides faults, not to forbid harmless annotations whose only effect is to document intent or silence diagnostics. Therefore the reported violation is not a correct application of Rule 2.2 to this code: these casts-to-void are acceptable idioms and are not treated as forbidden \"dead code\" in this context. \n\nConclusion: the report is not correct (this is not a valid Rule 2.2 violation)."
