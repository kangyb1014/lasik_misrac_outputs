True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe statement '(void) cls;' is an executed no\u2011op whose removal does not change program behaviour (it only suppresses an unused\u2011parameter warning). According to Rule 2.2 this is dead code because it performs an operation with no effect on the program; therefore the rule is violated. Recommended correction: remove the no\u2011op or use an approved MISRA\u2011compliant mechanism to document/suppress unused parameter warnings (e.g. a standardized UNUSED_PARAM macro or adjust the function prototype), so that no executed no\u2011op remains.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. The three (void) parameter statements in ahc_echo are the common idiom to document intentionally unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings. Although a (void)cast expression statement has no runtime effect, its presence is an intentional annotation and does not change the program's runtime behaviour; MISRA guidance treats unused-parameter suppression as an acceptable technique (or is addressed by other MISRA guidance/allowed deviations), and the usual remedy is to use a standardized UNUSED_PARAM macro, an attribute such as ((unused)), or to omit the parameter name where permitted. In short, this use of (void)parameter; should not be treated as a Rule 2.2 violation in practice; the report is therefore incorrect."
