  "explanation": "The only potentially recursive/indirect-recursive call sites in this function are calls to non-standard/user-defined routines that might (directly or via callbacks) invoke read_cb again. The call to compress_buf is the primary suspect because its implementation is not shown; it receives holder->stream and holder->buf and could call back into the content-reader callback (read_cb) either directly or indirectly. The fread call is included because it operates on holder->file \u2014 if holder->file is not a plain stdio FILE but a wrapper or uses callbacks it could lead to indirect recursion; in typical code this is unlikely, but it should be verified. All other fragments (malloc, memcpy, free, the simple checks/returns, conversions, and use of standard macros/constants) invoke only standard library functions or perform local operations and therefore do not present a realistic risk of calling read_cb directly or indirectly and need not be investigated for Rule 17.2 compliance."
