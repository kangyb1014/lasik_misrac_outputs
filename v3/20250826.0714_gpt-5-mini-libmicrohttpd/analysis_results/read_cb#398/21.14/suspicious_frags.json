  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided read_cb function there is no call to memcmp, and there are no string-comparison operations on null-terminated strings (no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp usage). The code only performs buffer allocation, fread (binary read), a call to compress_buf (whose internals are outside this snippet), memcpy to copy a known size of bytes, and frees. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that match the rule violation. Note: if compress_buf is implemented elsewhere, its implementation would need to be checked separately for memcmp-on-strings, but that function is not part of the given code and so is not flagged here."
