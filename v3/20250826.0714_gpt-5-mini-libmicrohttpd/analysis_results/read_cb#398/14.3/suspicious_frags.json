  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do) with constant conditions, and every conditional depends on runtime values or function results: \n- if (pos > SSIZE_MAX) depends on the pos parameter;\n- if (NULL == src) depends on malloc returning NULL or not;\n- if (0 == r_size) depends on the result of fread;\n- the ternary using ferror(...) depends on stream state;\n- if (MHD_YES != compress_buf(...)) depends on the return value of compress_buf.\nAll controlling expressions can vary at runtime, so none appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (the allowed exceptions for intentional infinite loops or the do-while constant-false case are not present)."
