  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: fread is called with the same 'size' that was used to allocate 'src' (src = malloc(size)), so at most 'size' bytes are written into the allocated buffer. Therefore the fread call cannot itself cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. (Note: Rule 21.17 concerns functions from <string.h>; fread is from <stdio.h> and, in this code, the allocation and read sizes match. Edge cases such as malloc(size)==NULL are handled; malloc(0) may return non\u2011NULL but fread will read 0 bytes \u2014 still safe.)"
