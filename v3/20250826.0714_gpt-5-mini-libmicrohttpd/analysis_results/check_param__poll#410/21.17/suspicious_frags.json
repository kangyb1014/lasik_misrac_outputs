  "explanation": "No string handling functions from <string.h> are used in this function. The code contains: (1) a boolean check of tool_params.poll, (2) a call to MHD_is_feature_supported compared to MHD_NO, (3) a call to fprintf with a compile-time concatenated string literal, and (4) simple return statements. None of these invoke memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other <string.h> function, nor do they perform pointer arithmetic or buffer manipulation that could result in out-of-bounds accesses related to the string functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fprintf call uses stdio and prints a literal; the literal is stored in read-only memory and is not subject to the string-handling bounds concerns of Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 21.17."
