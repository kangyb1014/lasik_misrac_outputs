  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__poll:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__poll (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.poll)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_POLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"poll() was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support polling by poll().\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment 'return ! 0;' is an executed return that yields 1 (logical negation of 0). This is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because the statement determines the function's return value and cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. (Although the '!' on a constant zero is redundant and a compiler will constant-fold it, that redundancy is not a Rule 2.2 dead-code violation \u2014 it may be noted by a different guideline about unnecessary operations or style.)"
