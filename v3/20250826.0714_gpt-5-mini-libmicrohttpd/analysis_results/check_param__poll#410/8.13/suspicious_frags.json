  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer parameters appear in this function body that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer-like uses are: (1) stderr (type FILE *), which must be non-const because I/O functions modify the stream; and (2) the string literal passed to fprintf, which is used as a const char * parameter (fprintf\u2019s format parameter is const-qualified). The calls to MHD_is_feature_supported and the constants MHD_FEATURE_POLL/MHD_NO are not pointer expressions in this fragment, and tool_params.poll is a scalar (not a pointer) as used here. Therefore there are no code fragments within this function that need investigation for Rule 8.13."
