  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any indirect use that would compare null-terminated strings are present in the provided function. The code only does:\n- a boolean/flag check: if (! tool_params.poll)\n- a library/feature query: if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_POLL))\n- a fprintf of string literals\n- simple return statements (including use of '!0')\n\nNone of these use memcmp to compare strings, nor do they perform raw buffer comparisons of char arrays. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If you want me to scan other functions/files, provide their code as well."
