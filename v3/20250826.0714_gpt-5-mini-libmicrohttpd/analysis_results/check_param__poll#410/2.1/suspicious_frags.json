  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: the function has three distinct, mutually exclusive control paths, each reachable under plausible runtime conditions: (1) if (!tool_params.poll) the first return executes when poll is false; (2) if tool_params.poll is true and MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_POLL) equals MHD_NO, the fprintf and return 0 execute; (3) if tool_params.poll is true and the feature is supported, the final return ! 0 executes. There are no statements after a return, no constant conditional expressions within this snippet that would make a branch impossible, and the odd-looking return ! 0 is a valid, reachable expression (it evaluates to 1). Based on only the code shown, no unreachable code needs investigation."
