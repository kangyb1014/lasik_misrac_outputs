  "explanation": "There is no direct call to check_param__poll in the function body, so no obvious direct recursion. The only statements that could introduce indirect recursion are function calls or expressions that may expand to function calls (or call back into this module). Therefore I reported the lines that perform or may involve calls: the call to MHD_is_feature_supported, the fprintf call, and the access to tool_params.poll (in case it is a macro or accessor that invokes code). Other fragments (function signature, return statements such as \"return ! 0;\", the string literals, braces and simple conditionals) do not perform function calls and cannot themselves create direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 17.2."
