  "explanation": "The function check_param__poll has no parameters (signature: check_param__poll(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable. All identifiers referenced inside the function are either globals (tool_params.poll, stderr), constants (MHD_NO, MHD_FEATURE_POLL), or calls to other functions (MHD_is_feature_supported, fprintf). There are no assignments to any parameter, no pointer parameters, and no modifications of pointer values within this function, so no code fragments require investigation for Rule 17.8."
