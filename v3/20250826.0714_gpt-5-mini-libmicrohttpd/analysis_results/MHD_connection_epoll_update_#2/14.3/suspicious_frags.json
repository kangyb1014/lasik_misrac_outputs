  "explanation": "Only selection/conditional controlling expressions are relevant for MISRA C: Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). The fragments listed above are all the conditional/selection expressions in the function that need inspection for potential invariance. Other code in the function does not contain controlling expressions that could violate Rule 14.3, so they do not require investigation for this rule. In particular, the following do NOT need investigation for Rule 14.3: - EDLL_insert(...) call and other function calls that are not used as controlling expressions. - Assignments and bitwise operations (e.g. event.events = ..., event.data.ptr = ..., connection->epoll_state |= ...) which are not controlling expressions. - Struct initializations (struct epoll_event event;) and simple returns (return MHD_YES/MHD_NO) and state updates (connection->state = ...) which are not selection/iteration controlling expressions. - The mhd_assert(...) invocation (it is an assertion macro, not a selection/iteration controlling expression in the function flow relevant to Rule 14.3). No loops (for/while/do) appear in the function, so there are no loop-controlling expressions to consider. Therefore only the listed if/conditional expressions need to be investigated for potential invariance under MISRA C Rule 14.3."
