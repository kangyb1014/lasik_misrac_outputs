  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the conditional blocks whose entry conditions or configuration-dependent code could make their bodies unreachable at runtime or in a given build configuration: (1) the block that inserts the connection into the 'eready' list (depends on event_loop_info and epoll_state flags), (2) the large block that adds the socket to the epoll set including the error-handling return (depends on multiple epoll_state flags and event_loop_info), and (3) the logging block guarded by HAVE_MESSAGES (may be excluded or the runtime condition may never be true). These places should be investigated to ensure none of them are provably unreachable under the project's configuration or invariants.\n\nThe remaining lines were not selected because they are simple declarations, assertions, straightforward assignments or the final return and do not by themselves constitute unreachable code independent of the flagged conditionals: the daemon declaration and mhd_assert are initialization/checks, the epoll_event field assignments and epoll_ctl call are inside the flagged conditional (so covered), the state/cleanup/return on error are part of the error path already included, and the final 'return MHD_YES;' is reachable unless the earlier error return is taken. Therefore those parts do not need separate investigation for Rule 2.1 beyond the conditionals already reported."
