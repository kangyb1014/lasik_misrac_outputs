  "explanation": "No fragments modify the parameter variable 'connection' itself. I inspected the function for any assignments or updates to the parameter identifier (e.g. \"connection = ...\", pointer arithmetic on connection, or passing the address of the parameter for modification) and found none. The code does modify objects referred to by the pointer (e.g. connection->epoll_state |= ..., connection->state = ...), which is permitted by the rule (the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The local pointer 'daemon' is declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;' \u2014 the pointer is const and is a local variable, not a modification of the function parameter. Assigning event.data.ptr = connection stores the pointer into a local epoll_event structure and does not modify the parameter variable. Calls such as EDLL_insert(..., connection) and cleanup_connection(connection) operate on the pointed-to object or pass the pointer by value; they do not reassign the function parameter within this function. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
