  "explanation": "Only the fragments above are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they involve calls to the string.h function memcmp and the size/null checks that govern the length of the memcmp access. No other string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are used elsewhere in this function, so there are no additional locations that could violate Rule 21.17. The loop control and numeric logic do not perform string/library memory accesses and therefore do not need investigation for this rule. The included size-equality checks and mhd_assert() calls are part of the preconditions that must be verified when assessing whether the memcmp calls can access beyond object bounds, so they are included for inspection."
