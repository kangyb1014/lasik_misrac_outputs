  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in this function. Analysis by parameter:\n- cls: Only cast to struct test_header_param* and used to access param->connection and param->num_headers. The statement param->num_headers++ modifies the object pointed to by cls, which is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The pointer parameter cls itself is not assigned to or altered.\n- key and value (const char*): Used only in mhd_assert checks and passed to memcmp; neither the pointers nor the characters they point to are modified. They are treated as const throughout.\n- key_size and value_size (size_t): Only read and compared against pos->header_size and pos->value_size; not assigned to or modified.\n- kind (enum MHD_ValueKind): Only read and compared to pos->kind; not modified.\nOther local variables (param, connection, pos, i) are locals and may be modified. No pointer parameter is reassigned, so there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this code fragment."
