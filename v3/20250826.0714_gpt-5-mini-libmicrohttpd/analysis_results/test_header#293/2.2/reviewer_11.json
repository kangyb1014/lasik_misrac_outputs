True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call mhd_assert(NULL != key) is an assertion-only operation. If mhd_assert is implemented as an assert-like macro that becomes a no-op in release builds (e.g. under NDEBUG or similar), the call has no effect at runtime and its removal would not change program behaviour. In that case the statement constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert performs a runtime action with observable effects (logging, abort, etc.), then it is not dead code and the rule is not violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not definitively correct \u2014 it is conditional. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code: operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the mhd_assert calls are \"dead\" depends on how mhd_assert is defined in the project build.\n\n- If mhd_assert is implemented as an assert-like macro that produces an observable runtime effect (logging, abort, diagnostics, etc.), then those calls are not dead code and there is no Rule 2.2 violation.\n- If mhd_assert is implemented as a no-op in the project configuration used for compliance (for example it expands to ((void)0) or is removed under NDEBUG so it has no observable effect), then the assertion-only operations have no effect at runtime and their removal would not change program behaviour in that build \u2014 in that case they are dead code and would violate Rule 2.2.\n\nBecause the code excerpt does not show the definition of mhd_assert and MISRA compliance is assessed with respect to the actual project configuration, you cannot conclude a violation from the snippet alone. The agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct as a conditional statement, but a concrete violation can only be reported if mhd_assert is indeed a no-op in the project build used for the MISRA assessment. As a best practice, do not rely on assertions for behaviour or side effects that must remain in production code; ensure assertion macros have documented observable behaviour or remove assertion-only statements that would otherwise be dead code."
