  "explanation": "No loops (for, while, do-while) are present in the function, so there are no loop controlling expressions to inspect for invariance under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The code contains only if statements and function return checks (e.g. if (NULL == md), if (0 != extra_in_size), if (NULL == md->extra_in), if (0 != pthread_create(...))) whose controlling expressions depend on runtime values (allocation results, extra_in_size, pthread_create return) and are not invariant. The (void) casts are simply to silence unused-parameter warnings and are not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.3 that require investigation."
