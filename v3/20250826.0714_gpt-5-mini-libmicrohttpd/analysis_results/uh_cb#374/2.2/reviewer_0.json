  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. The three lines such as '(void) connection;' are the conventional, intentional idiom to mark an unused parameter and to suppress compiler warnings. Although such an expression statement performs no observable side effect and its removal would not change program behaviour, MISRA\u2019s intent is to forbid inadvertent, leftover dead code, not deliberate annotations that document intent and preserve an API (or satisfy a fixed callback signature). The '(void)param;' idiom is a recognized, deliberate way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter (or to avoid warnings) and is not treated as a violation of Rule 2.2 in this context. If you prefer to avoid these casts entirely, alternatives include using compiler-specific \"unused\" attributes or omitting the parameter name where the language and prototype allow, but the code as shown does not constitute a MISRA 2023 Rule 2.2 violation."
