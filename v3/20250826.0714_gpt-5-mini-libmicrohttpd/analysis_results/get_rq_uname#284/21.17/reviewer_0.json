True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code assigns uname_info->username = buf + buf_used and then calls get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z without supplying or checking the remaining buffer space. If params->username (after unquoting) is longer than the remaining buffer (buf_size - buf_used - 1) the copy function will write the bytes plus a terminating NUL beyond buf, causing an out-of-bounds access. The later mhd_assert(buf_size >= buf_used) only checks after the write and does not prevent the overflow. The extended-uname path correctly passes the remaining size, but this standard-uname path performs no bounds check \u2014 therefore Rule 21.17 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the STANDARD uname path the code sets uname_info->username = (char *)(buf + buf_used) and then calls get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z(&params->username, uname_info->username) with no indication of the remaining buffer capacity. There is no prior check that (buf_size - buf_used) is large enough to hold the copied bytes plus the terminating NUL. If get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z performs a copy (directly or indirectly using string.h functions such as memcpy/strcpy) without being given the destination capacity, it may write beyond the end of buf and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The subsequent mhd_assert(buf_size >= buf_used) only checks the invariant after the write and cannot prevent the overflow. The EXTENDED path does pass the remaining buffer size and is safe in that regard, but the STANDARD path is not. The only way this would not be a violation is if get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z is documented/implemented to never write more than the actual remaining space (for example it internally knows the maximum possible length and enforces it); without that guarantee the code is non\u2011compliant. Recommended fixes: pass the remaining buffer size to the copy function or check the source length against (buf_size - buf_used - 1) before copying."
