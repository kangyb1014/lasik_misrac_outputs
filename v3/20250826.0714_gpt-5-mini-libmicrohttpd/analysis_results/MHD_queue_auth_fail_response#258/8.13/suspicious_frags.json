  "explanation": "The remaining pointer uses in the snippet do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: the string parameters are already const-qualified (const char *realm, const char *opaque), there are no other pointer-typed parameters or pointer returns in the fragment, and the only other items used (the enum return type, the int parameter, and the MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 macro) are not pointer types. Therefore only non-const pointer parameters warrant further review."
