  "explanation": "The provided function contains no controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) operator). It only returns the result of a direct function call: MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2(..., MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5). A constant passed as an argument is not a controlling expression subject to MISRA C Rule 14.3, and there are no loops or conditional expressions to inspect. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 14.3."
