  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not use compiler language extensions as defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. uint64_t and size_t are standard integer types from C (stdint.h / stddef.h), and FILE, fseek, fread, ferror and SEEK_SET are standard C library facilities (not compiler language extensions). The cast (long) pos and the void* to FILE* conversion are standard C operations (not compiler-specific extensions). The MHD_CONTENT_READER_* identifiers are library API macros (application/library-specific, not compiler language extensions) and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 1.2. No other compiler-specific keywords or attributes (such as __attribute__, __asm, __int128, long long as a compiler-only extension, or similar vendor-specific constructs) appear in the remaining code, so they need not be investigated for Rule 1.2."
