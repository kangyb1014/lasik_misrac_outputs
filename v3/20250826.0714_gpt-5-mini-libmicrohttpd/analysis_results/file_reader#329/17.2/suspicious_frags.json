  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function shows direct or indirect recursion. The only function calls in file_reader are fseek, fread and ferror (standard C library calls) and there is no call to file_reader itself. There are no function-pointer invocations, no callback registrations, and no use of macros or expressions that expand to calls to file_reader. Casting cls to FILE* and using it as the stream argument to the standard I/O calls does not create any recursion. The returned identifiers (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM) appear as values, not function calls. Therefore there are no fragments requiring further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self-calls, direct or indirect)."
