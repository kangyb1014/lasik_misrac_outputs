  "explanation": "I have limited the suspicious fragments to operations that could plausibly produce code that executes but has no effect on observable behavior (and thus merit investigation for Rule 2.2). Other parts of the function need not be investigated for dead code: the function signature and control structure are required for the reader API; the comment block is non-executable; the local initialization of 'file' is an initialization (note 3 of the rule) rather than an assignment and so is not a candidate; the final return of the read byte count (the cast to ssize_t) is the function result and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; and simple syntactic elements (braces, variable declarations) are not executable operations that could be dead code. The three selected fragments are the execution points where platform-dependent behavior or always-taken/never-taken branches could make subsequent code effectively removable and therefore should be investigated."
