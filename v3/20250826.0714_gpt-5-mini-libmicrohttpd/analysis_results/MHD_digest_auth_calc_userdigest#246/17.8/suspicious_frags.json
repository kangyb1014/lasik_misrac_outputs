  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Details:\n- algo3 is an enum passed by value and only used as an argument to get_base_digest_algo(); it is not assigned to or changed.\n- username, realm, and password are const char * and only read (passed to strlen and calc_userdigest); there are no assignments, increments/decrements, or pointer rebindings to these parameters.\n- userdigest_bin (void *) is passed to calc_userdigest, which may modify the object it points to \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8 \u2014 but the parameter variable userdigest_bin itself is not reassigned or altered in this function.\n- bin_buf_size is a size_t passed by value and only compared; it is not modified.\n- No operations (assignments, increments/decrements, or pointer rebindings) on any parameter occur in the body.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
