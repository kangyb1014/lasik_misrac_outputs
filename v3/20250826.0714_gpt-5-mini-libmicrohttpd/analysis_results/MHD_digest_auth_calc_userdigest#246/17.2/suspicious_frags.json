  "explanation": "Only function calls (and the conditional compilation block that contains a call) are reported because MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.2 concerns functions calling themselves directly or indirectly. These reported fragments are the points where control flows into other functions that might (directly or indirectly) call back to MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest and therefore must be investigated for recursion. Other parts of the function do not invoke other functions (declarations, enum/variable definitions, simple assignments, use of literal macros MHD_YES/MHD_NO, the return statement, and the surrounding control-flow structure) and thus cannot by themselves create direct or indirect self-calls, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
