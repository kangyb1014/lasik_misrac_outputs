  "scenario": "The assignment ret = MHD_YES; is not dead in the general case: it establishes the default success return value for the else branch and can be preserved or overridden later by the digest_ext_error() check. However, a violation can occur in a specific configuration: if MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR is defined and digest_ext_error(&da) is guaranteed (by its implementation or build-time configuration) to always return true, then the subsequent assignment ret = MHD_NO; will always overwrite ret, so the earlier ret = MHD_YES; has no effect and is dead code. For example, if digest_ext_error() is implemented as a macro that always evaluates to true, or the function deterministically always returns true for the given DigestAlgorithm state for all reachable inputs, removing ret = MHD_YES; would not change program behaviour \u2014 thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
