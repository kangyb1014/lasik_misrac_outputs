The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest (enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 algo3,\n                                 const char *username,\n                                 const char *realm,\n                                 const char *password,\n                                 void *userdigest_bin,\n                                 size_t bin_buf_size)\n{\n  struct DigestAlgorithm da;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  if (! digest_init_one_time (&da, get_base_digest_algo (algo3)))\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (digest_get_size (&da) > bin_buf_size)\n    ret = MHD_NO;\n  else\n  {\n    calc_userdigest (&da,\n                     username,\n                     strlen (username),\n                     realm,\n                     strlen (realm),\n                     password,\n                     userdigest_bin);\n    ret = MHD_YES;\n\n#ifdef MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR\n    if (digest_ext_error (&da))\n      ret = MHD_NO;\n#endif /* MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR */\n  }\n  digest_deinit (&da);\n\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR\n    if (digest_ext_error (&da))\n      ret = MHD_NO;\n#endif /* MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "As written, the fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The conditional block is enabled only when MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR is defined and can legitimately change behavior by setting ret = MHD_NO when digest_ext_error(&da) returns true. This is not dead code because its removal (when the macro is defined) could change program behavior.\n\nNote: a violation scenario would exist if, in the actual project build, MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR is defined but the function digest_ext_error() is a pure function that always returns false and has no side effects: in that case the call and conditional would be executed but removing them would not affect program behavior, which would constitute dead code under Rule 2.2."
