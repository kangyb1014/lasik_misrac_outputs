  "explanation": "Only the _MHD_EXTERN macro at the function declaration needs investigation because such macros often expand to compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)), which are language/compiler extensions. All other constructs in the snippet are standard C: enums, size_t, void*, pointer parameters, strlen call, preprocessor conditional (#ifdef/#endif), standard control flow, and comments. There are no visible uses of known compiler extensions (no __attribute__, __declspec, inline assembly, typeof, statement expressions, builtin extensions, or other double-underscore compiler intrinsics) elsewhere in the code fragment, so they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
