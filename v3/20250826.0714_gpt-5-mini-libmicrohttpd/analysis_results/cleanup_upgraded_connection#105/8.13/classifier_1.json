  "scenario": "The pointer urh is used to free the object (free(urh)) and to access/close sockets; because the object is deallocated/manipulated, the pointer must be a non-const pointer. Therefore declaring it as struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh is appropriate. If the function only read the object and did not free or modify it, declaring a pointer to const would be recommended, but that is not the case here."
