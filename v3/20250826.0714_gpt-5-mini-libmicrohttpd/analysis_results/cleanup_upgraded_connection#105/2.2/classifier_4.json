  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_upgraded_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = connection->urh;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return;\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  /* Signal remote client the end of TLS connection by\n   * gracefully closing TLS session. */\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment connection->urh = NULL and the subsequent free(urh) both affect program behaviour: free() releases allocated memory (removing it would cause a leak) and setting connection->urh to NULL prevents a dangling pointer/use-after-free (removing it could change runtime behaviour if other code reads connection->urh). Therefore these operations are not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
