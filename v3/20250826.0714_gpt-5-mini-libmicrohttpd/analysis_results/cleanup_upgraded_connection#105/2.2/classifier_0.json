  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_upgraded_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = connection->urh;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return;\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  /* Signal remote client the end of TLS connection by\n   * gracefully closing TLS session. */\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown context: the call conditionally closes a socket (MHD_socket_close_chk_(urh->mhd.socket)); removing it would change runtime behaviour by leaving a socket open. This is therefore not dead code. (It would be dead only if urh->mhd.socket were provably always equal to MHD_INVALID_SOCKET \u2014 e.g. initialized to that value and never changed \u2014 which is not established from the provided fragment.)"
