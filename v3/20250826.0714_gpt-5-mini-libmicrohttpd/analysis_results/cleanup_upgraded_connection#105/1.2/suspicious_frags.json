  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided function. I inspected the code for common non\u2011standard constructs that compilers document as extensions (examples: __attribute__(), __asm__/__asm__(), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __extension__, GCC/Clang builtin magic like __builtin_*, zero\u2011length arrays as extension, and other vendor keywords). The code only contains standard C constructs: a static function definition, pointer dereferences, NULL checks, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT), calls to external/library functions (gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free), and macro/constants (MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, GNUTLS_SHUT_WR). Preprocessor conditionals and use of external library APIs/macros are not compiler language extensions per the rule. The left\u2011hand NULL comparison style (if (NULL == urh)) is a stylistic idiom, not an extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be reported for Rule 1.2."
