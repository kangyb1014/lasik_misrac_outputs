  "scenario": "The assignment connection->urh = NULL simply writes a pointer field; it does not invoke any function and therefore cannot cause direct or indirect recursion. No call to cleanup_upgraded_connection appears in the shown code. (Only if some called function such as gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_ or free were implemented to call cleanup_upgraded_connection would an indirect recursion occur \u2014 which is not the case for the standard/free and typical TLS/socket functions.)"
