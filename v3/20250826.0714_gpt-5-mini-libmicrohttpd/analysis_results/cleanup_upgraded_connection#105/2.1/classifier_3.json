  "scenario": "No violation in the provided fragment. The #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT removes the block entirely when HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined (not \u201cunreachable\u201d code \u2014 it is excluded at compile time), and the internal tests (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET checks) are runtime conditionals that can be true or false depending on program state, so the calls inside can be reached. A hypothetical violation scenario would be if the conditions were provably always false at compile time (for example if connection->daemon->options were a compile-time constant with MHD_USE_TLS bit always clear, or the socket values were known at compile time to always equal MHD_INVALID_SOCKET), making the guarded calls unreachable; that is not the case here."
