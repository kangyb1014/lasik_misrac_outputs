Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const void *cls') when possible. Declaring it as 'void *cls' in this context constitutes a violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The parameter 'void *cls' is part of the callback signature required by the microhttpd-style API; its type must match the external function prototype used by the library. You cannot change it to 'const void *' without breaking the required callback type (and making it incompatible with callers that pass a mutable void*). MISRA Rule 8.13 is meant to encourage const qualification where it is practicable, but it does not require changing a function to a different prototype that must match an external API. Therefore this reported violation is not valid for this code as written."
