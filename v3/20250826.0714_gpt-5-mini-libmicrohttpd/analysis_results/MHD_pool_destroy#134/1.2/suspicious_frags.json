  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the given snippet. The code contains standard C constructs (function definition, if/else, return, free, abort), standard preprocessor conditionals (#if/#elif/#else/#endif) and calls to OS APIs (munmap, VirtualFree) which are platform-specific library calls but not compiler language extensions. Identifiers like _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN are macros or functions (not shown) and their presence alone does not indicate a compiler extension. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm__, __builtin_..., typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) as a GCC extension, __int128, or other documented compiler-only keywords. Therefore no fragments require further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
