  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. In this fragment pool->memory is being freed (ownership transferred to free/munmap/VirtualFree), so it must be a modifiable pointer type (free takes void *). Rule 8.13 recommends adding const where possible, but not when the pointer denotes owned, deallocatable memory. A hypothetical violation would be if struct MemoryPool declared memory as a non-const pointer but the pointed-to object is never modified anywhere \u2014 e.g. it should be declared const char *memory \u2014 however that would be incompatible with calling free without a cast. Given only the shown code, there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 violation."
