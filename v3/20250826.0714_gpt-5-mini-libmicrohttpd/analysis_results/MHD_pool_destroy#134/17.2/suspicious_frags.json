  "explanation": "The listed fragments cover every function call (or macro that may expand to a call) present in MHD_pool_destroy. No other expressions in this function perform function calls: the initial NULL check and the return are simple control-flow, the member accesses (pool->...) and arithmetic/comparisons are not calls (and any preprocessor conditionals are compile-time), so they cannot directly or indirectly cause recursion beyond the items already listed. Therefore only the above call sites need investigation for potential direct or indirect self-calls."
