  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call free(pool->memory) invokes the C library free(), which does not call user functions and therefore does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_pool_destroy. A possible violation scenario would be if free had been replaced/redefined by a custom allocator that, during its processing, called MHD_pool_destroy (for example a debug/free hook that triggers pool cleanup), which would create indirect recursion and thus violate Rule 17.2."
