  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call free(pool) is reachable when pool != NULL and either pool->is_mmap is false (the code takes the earlier free(pool->memory) path) or when the platform provides munmap/VirtualFree (the mmap branch returns and execution continues). The abort() in the #else of the platform #if only prevents fallthrough on that specific path; it does not make free(pool) unreachable for the whole project. (A violation would occur only in a project configuration and runtime where every possible path before free(pool) ends in a non-returning call \u2014 e.g. if pool->is_mmap were always true in that project and MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32 are both undefined so the compiled code always calls abort() before reaching free(pool))."
