  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general. The abort() call is inside a preprocessor #else and is only compiled when neither MAP_ANONYMOUS nor _WIN32 are defined; in that configuration it is reachable at runtime whenever pool->is_mmap is true. Rule 2.1 would be violated only if the translation unit containing abort() is compiled into the project but there is no possible runtime path to reach it (for example, if pool->is_mmap were provably always false in that build so the else branch can never be taken), in which case abort() would be unreachable."
