  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: munmap is not one of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Rule 21.17 concerns functions such as memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/strcat/strlen/etc.; this call to munmap does not invoke any of those and therefore does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: unrelated runtime errors could occur if pool->memory or pool->size are invalid, but that is not a Rule 21.17 violation.)"
