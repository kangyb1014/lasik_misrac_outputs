  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found because the provided function contains no use of memcmp and no comparisons of null-terminated strings. The code only performs pointer/null checks, integer comparisons (via mhd_assert), memory unpoisoning (_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY), and deallocation (free, munmap, VirtualFree, abort). There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or other string-comparison functions, nor any explicit byte-wise comparisons of char arrays that could be comparing null-terminated strings. The macros present (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) do not in this snippet indicate string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 21.14 in this code sample."
