  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function. The function contains a single sequence of statements with no conditional branches, early returns, or compile-time constructs (e.g. #if/#ifdef blocks) that would make any statement in this snippet impossible to execute. The call to MHD_bin_to_hex is executed, the assignment to hex[res] and the return res are reachable in normal flow. (External functions that never return or unusual control transfer from MHD_bin_to_hex would be an implementation/behavioral issue outside this fragment and do not make any statement here statically unreachable.)"
