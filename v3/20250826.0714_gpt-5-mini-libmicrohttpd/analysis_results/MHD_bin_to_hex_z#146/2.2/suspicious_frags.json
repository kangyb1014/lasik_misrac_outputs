Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation under Rule 2.2: the function signature and prologue/epilogue (size_t MHD_bin_to_hex_z(...){ and the braces) are structural and not executable operations that could be dead; the declaration 'size_t res;' only reserves storage for a value that is used by the function; the return statement returns the computed value and affects observable behaviour (cannot be removed without changing the function contract). There are no additional executed statements in the body beyond those listed as suspicious, so no other code fragments can be dead code in this function."
