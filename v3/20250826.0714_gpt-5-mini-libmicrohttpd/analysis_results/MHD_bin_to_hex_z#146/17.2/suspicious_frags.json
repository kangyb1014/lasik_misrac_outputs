    "size_t\nMHD_bin_to_hex_z (const void *bin,\n                  size_t size,\n                  char *hex)\n{",

  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function body are simple operations that cannot create direct or indirect recursion: the null-termination (hex[res] = 0;) and the return (return res;) do not invoke any other function. The function signature/declaration and the single function call are the only places where recursion could originate or be wired through other functions; therefore other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. To determine if Rule 17.2 is violated an inspection of the implementation of MHD_bin_to_hex (and any functions it calls) is required to check for indirect calls back to this function."
