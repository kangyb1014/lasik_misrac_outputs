  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- The function definition and parameter list use standard C syntax (no K&R style or nonstandard parameter declaration).  \n- The type size_t and pointer types (const void *, char *) are standard C types/constructs (their use is not an extension; any required headers are a portability/compile issue, not a language-extension).  \n- The call to MHD_bin_to_hex(...) is a normal function call; its presence does not imply a language extension.  \n- The assignment hex[res] = 0; uses the integer literal 0 to store the NUL character, which is standard C.  \n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens (for example __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __typeof__, _Pragma with implementation-specific semantics, calling-convention keywords like __stdcall, or GNU statement expressions ({ ... })).  \n- There is no inline assembler, no use of typeof, no variable-length array extensions, no designated initializers with nonstandard forms, and no other known vendor-specific constructs.\n\nTherefore, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (disallow language extensions) there are no fragments in this function that need further investigation for use of compiler language extensions."
