  "explanation": "No code fragments in show_help() call the function itself, either directly or indirectly within the displayed code. The body only makes calls to printf and a single conditional call to MHD_is_feature_supported; there are no calls to show_help(), no function-pointer calls, no callbacks, and no other local functions invoked that could form an indirect cycle. All calls are to library or external API functions (printf, MHD_is_feature_supported) which are not defined in this translation unit and there is no evidence in the provided code that they call back into show_help. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (self- or indirect recursion)."
