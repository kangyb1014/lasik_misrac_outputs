  "explanation": "I examined the entire show_help function provided. There are no calls to the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any other explicit comparisons of null-terminated strings (e.g., strcmp, strncmp, or memcmp) in this function. The code consists solely of printf calls with string literals and a call to MHD_is_feature_supported; no memcmp usage appears in the fragment shown. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If desired, callers or other translation units\u2014e.g. the implementation of MHD_is_feature_supported\u2014could be inspected separately, but they are not part of the provided code fragment.)"
