If, however, tool_copyright is declared as const char * (or otherwise const-qualified), there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The show_help function itself does not declare tool_copyright (nor self_name), so you cannot determine a MISRA 8.13 violation from this snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when they refer to data that is not modified. If tool_copyright (or self_name) is actually declared as a non-const pointer to read\u2011only data (e.g. char *tool_copyright = \"...\"), then that declaration would indeed be contrary to the intent of Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const char *tool_copyright. Conversely, if the identifiers are declared as const char * (or otherwise const-qualified), there is no violation. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim as stated (that the shown code violates Rule 8.13) is not definitively correct without the declarations; the underlying conditional reasoning in the scenario is correct, but the report as a concrete violation of the shown code is incomplete."
