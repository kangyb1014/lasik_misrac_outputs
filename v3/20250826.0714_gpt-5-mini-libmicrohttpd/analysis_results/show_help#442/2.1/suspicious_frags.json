  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasons:\n- There is no return, break, goto, or exit call preceding any subsequent statements that would make later code unreachable.\n- The two if-statements (checking MHD_is_feature_supported) are runtime checks; their bodies are reachable depending on the function result, so they are not statically unreachable.\n- No preprocessor conditionals (e.g., #if 0) or compile-time constant conditions are present that would render code unreachable.\n- All printf calls are directly reachable when show_help is invoked; string literal concatenation across lines does not create unreachable code.\nTherefore no code fragments in this function require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
