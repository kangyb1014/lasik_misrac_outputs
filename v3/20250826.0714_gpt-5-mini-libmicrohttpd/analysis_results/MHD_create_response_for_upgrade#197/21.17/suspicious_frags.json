  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains memory allocation (MHD_calloc_), pointer assignments, mutex initialization, simple integer/ pointer field assignments, free/ destroy calls, and an early NULL check. None of those lines invoke or pass buffers to the standard <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn), nor do they manipulate or derive string buffer lengths within this snippet. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The listed fragment calling MHD_add_response_header is the only place in this code that passes string parameters (string literal and header macro) to an external routine that may internally use <string.h> functions and thus needs inspection to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur."
