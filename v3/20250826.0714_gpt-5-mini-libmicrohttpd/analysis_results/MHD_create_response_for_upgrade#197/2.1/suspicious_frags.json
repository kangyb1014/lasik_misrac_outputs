  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists of straightforward, reachable statements following normal control flow: allocation and initialization of the response object, assignment of fields (upgrade_handler, upgrade_handler_cls, total_size, reference_count), and the final return response; none of these are syntactically unreachable (no code appears after an unconditional return within the same block). The error-handling return statements shown above are explicitly reachable via their conditional checks. No other preprocessor-excluded regions, dead-code patterns (e.g. code following an unconditional infinite loop or a return), or unreachable labels are present elsewhere in this function, so they do not require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
