  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment alone. The token _MHD_EXTERN is a macro identifier, and its presence does not by itself constitute a language extension. If the macro expands to standard C storage-class specifier(s) (e.g. extern) there is no Rule 1.2 violation. However, if _MHD_EXTERN expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example __declspec(dllexport), __attribute__((visibility(...))) or any other vendor-specific keyword/attribute documented as an extension), that expansion would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Verify the macro definition to confirm whether a compiler-specific extension is used."
