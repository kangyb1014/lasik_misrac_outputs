  "explanation": "I selected the fragments above because they reference identifiers/macros that are commonly implemented as compiler- or platform-specific extensions (e.g. storage-class macros like _MHD_EXTERN that often expand to __declspec or __attribute__ annotations, and library-wrapper names with trailing/leading underscores that may map to nonstandard runtime/ABI features). The rest of the code uses only standard C language constructs: function definition/parameters, pointer assignment, sizeof, NULL, if/return, free(), string literals, and standard preprocessor conditionals (defined(...)). No explicit compiler-specific keywords or known extension syntax (such as __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, or inline assembly) appear elsewhere in the fragment, so those parts need not be investigated for Rule 1.2."
