  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: upgrade_handler and upgrade_handler_cls. The code only reads upgrade_handler for a NULL check and then stores the parameter values into fields of the newly allocated response object (response->upgrade_handler = upgrade_handler; response->upgrade_handler_cls = upgrade_handler_cls;). Storing a parameter's value into another object does not modify the parameter itself. There are no assignments to upgrade_handler or upgrade_handler_cls (no writes like upgrade_handler = ... or upgrade_handler_cls = ...), and no parameters are passed by address to be overwritten. Other operations (allocating response, initializing mutex, setting response fields, calling MHD_add_response_header) do not modify the function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
