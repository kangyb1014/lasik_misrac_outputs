  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function are dependent on runtime variables (e.g. bytes_have, ctx->count, bytes_have < MD5_BLOCK_SIZE, MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have < MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD) and therefore are not invariant and do not need investigation under Rule 14.3. There are no loops with constant conditions (no intentionally infinite-loop constructs) and no other if-statements or loop conditions that evaluate to a compile-time constant within the provided function body. The two reported fragments are the only places where the C-level controlling expressions can be syntactically invariant (e.g. reduced to `if (1)` by preprocessing), so they should be examined to determine whether the preprocessor configuration or intent justifies the invariant condition under MISRA Rule 14.3 exceptions."
