  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment simply computes bytes_have = (unsigned int)(ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1)); which yields a value in the range 0..(MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1) and does not invoke any <string.h> functions. Therefore this expression cannot by itself cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via memcpy/memset. The subsequent uses of bytes_have (e.g. as an offset/length to memset) are bounded by MD5_BLOCK_SIZE, so provided MD5_BLOCK_SIZE and ctx->buffer are correctly sized the overall code remains safe w.r.t.
