  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The only relevant library call is memcpy, which copies bytes and does not perform comparisons of null-terminated strings; the MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There are also no calls to strcmp/strncmp or other comparison functions that would trigger Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
