  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if (buf_size < *ppos + append_size)\n    return false;",
    "*ppos += append_size;",
    "memcpy (buf + *ppos, append, append_size);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only the lines that perform the bounds check, the call to memcpy, and the update of *ppos need investigation for potential out-of-bounds access and integer overflow that could defeat the bounds check. The mhd_assert(NULL != buf) is a null-pointer assertion (not a string.h call) and does not itself cause or prevent buffer overrun beyond ensuring buf is non-NULL. The function signature, return statements, and use of size_t types are not directly invoking <string.h> functions and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17; the rule specifically targets uses of the standard string/memory functions (here memcpy) and the surrounding arithmetic that could allow accesses beyond the referenced objects."
