  "scenario": "The code can overflow the size_t addition used in the bounds check, allowing memcpy to access beyond the buffer. Example: on a 32-bit size_t, let buf_size = 100, *ppos = SIZE_MAX - 15 (4294967280), append_size = 20. Then *ppos + append_size wraps to 9, so (buf_size < *ppos + append_size) is false and memcpy(buf + *ppos, append, append_size) will attempt to write 20 bytes starting at an out-of-bounds address. The subsequent '*ppos += append_size;' stores the wrapped (incorrect) position. Thus Rule 21.17 is violated."
