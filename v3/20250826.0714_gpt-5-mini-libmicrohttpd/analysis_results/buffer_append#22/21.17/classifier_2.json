  "scenario": "Yes \u2014 the pre-check can be defeated by size_t overflow. For example, with size_t buf_size = 100; *ppos = SIZE_MAX - 5; append_size = 10; the expression *ppos + append_size overflows and wraps to a small value (e.g. 4). The test if (buf_size < *ppos + append_size) therefore evaluates to false and memcpy(buf + *ppos, append, append_size) is executed, copying 10 bytes to an address buf + (SIZE_MAX - 5) well beyond the allocated buffer. Thus the memcpy can access out-of-bounds memory and violates Rule 21.17."
