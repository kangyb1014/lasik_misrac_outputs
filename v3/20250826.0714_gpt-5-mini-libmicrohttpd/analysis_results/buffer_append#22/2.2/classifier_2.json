  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of buffer_append:\n```c\nstatic bool\nbuffer_append (char *buf,\n               size_t *ppos,\n               size_t buf_size,\n               const char *append,\n               size_t append_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != buf); /* Mute static analyzer */\n  if (buf_size < *ppos + append_size)\n    return false;\n  memcpy (buf + *ppos, append, append_size);\n  *ppos += append_size;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (buf_size < *ppos + append_size)\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The check is not dead: it performs an early return when there is insufficient room and removing it would change behavior (allowing an out-of-bounds memcpy and ppos update). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated here. (If elsewhere in the project a proven invariant guarantees buf_size >= *ppos + append_size for every call, then this branch would be provably never taken and would become dead code \u2014 in that case Rule 2.2 would be violated.)"
