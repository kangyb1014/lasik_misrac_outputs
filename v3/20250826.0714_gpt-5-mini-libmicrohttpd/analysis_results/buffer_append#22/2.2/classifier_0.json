  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of buffer_append:\n```c\nstatic bool\nbuffer_append (char *buf,\n               size_t *ppos,\n               size_t buf_size,\n               const char *append,\n               size_t append_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != buf); /* Mute static analyzer */\n  if (buf_size < *ppos + append_size)\n    return false;\n  memcpy (buf + *ppos, append, append_size);\n  *ppos += append_size;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemcpy (buf + *ppos, append, append_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The memcpy call is executed only when there is sufficient space and copies append_size bytes into the buffer; removing it would change program behaviour for append_size > 0 (and would break the function's purpose). Although for the special case append_size == 0 memcpy is a no-op (so that particular execution would be unaffected by removal), that is a data-dependent no-op, not code that is inherently dead for the project. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
