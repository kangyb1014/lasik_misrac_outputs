  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function exhibit direct or indirect self-calling behavior required for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Reasons:\n- The function buffer_append does not call buffer_append anywhere in its body (no direct recursion).\n- There are only two function/macro invocations: mhd_assert and memcpy. Neither is a call to buffer_append. There is no evidence that mhd_assert expands to or invokes buffer_append; assertion macros typically expand to diagnostic/abort helpers and would require explicit evidence to consider them a recursion path.\n- memcpy is a standard library routine and will not call the user-defined buffer_append.\n- There are no function-pointer parameters, no callbacks, and no global/function-table lookups in the code that could enable indirect recursion to buffer_append.\n- The function is declared static (internal linkage), which reduces the chance of external indirect calls; nothing in the fragment suggests self-reference elsewhere.\nGiven the above, there are no suspicious fragments to flag for potential direct or indirect self-calls."
