  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs only: 'bool' (standard via <stdbool.h>), size_t (standard via <stddef.h>/<stdint.h>), standard for-loop syntax (including the comma-separated increment expressions, which are part of standard C), character literals and escape sequences, and ordinary function calls. There are no GCC/Clang/MSC extensions (no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, inline-assembler, or other vendor-specific tokens) present. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
