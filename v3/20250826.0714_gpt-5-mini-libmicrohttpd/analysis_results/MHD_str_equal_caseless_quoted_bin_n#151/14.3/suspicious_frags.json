  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. Each control construct depends on either loop indices that are modified (i, j) or on input parameters (quoted_len, unquoted_len, quoted[], unquoted[]) or on the result of a function call, so none are constant at compile time:\n\n- Initial guard: if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2) \u2014 depends on input parameters (quoted_len, unquoted_len).\n- for loop condition: for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j) \u2014 depends on i and j which are incremented each iteration and on the input lengths; not invariant.\n- Escape check: if ('\\\\' == quoted[i]) \u2014 depends on quoted[i] which varies with i.\n- Post-escape bound check: if (quoted_len == i) \u2014 depends on i updated just before the check.\n- Character compare: if (! charsequalcaseless (quoted[i], unquoted[j])) \u2014 depends on quoted[i] and unquoted[j] and on the (presumably non-constant) function call result.\n- Final length check: if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j)) \u2014 depends on i and j after the loop and on input lengths.\n\nThe MISRA 14.3 exceptions (invariant infinite loops or the specific do-while constant-false case) do not apply here. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance."
