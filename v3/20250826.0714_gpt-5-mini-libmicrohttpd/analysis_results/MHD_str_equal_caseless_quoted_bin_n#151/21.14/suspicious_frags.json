  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. All comparisons are performed character-by-character via charsequalcaseless and explicit index/length checks (quoted_len, unquoted_len), so the function does not compare null-terminated strings using memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp or similar string-comparison routines in this fragment. The only external call, charsequalcaseless, compares single characters (not full strings) as used here; its implementation is not part of this fragment, so it cannot be flagged based on the given code. Therefore no fragments in this function need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
