  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameter and the local pointer variables and the code sites where those pointers are obtained/used because Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible; these are the locations where const qualification might be applicable and therefore should be investigated. Other pointer-related fragments were not flagged for investigation for the following reasons: - The timeout output is written to (*timeout64 = ...), so timeout64 is an output parameter and cannot be const-qualified. - Member accesses on 'daemon' (e.g. daemon->data_already_pending, daemon->cleanup_head, etc.) are reads of structure members; individual member expressions are not additional pointer declarations requiring const qualification beyond the daemon parameter itself. - Macro invocations and conditional checks (e.g. MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_(daemon), checks against NULL, EPOLL_SUPPORT blocks) are control-flow/diagnostic checks; they do not introduce new pointer declarations that could be const-qualified. - Assignments to pointer variables (e.g. pos = ...) are included only where they obtain a pointer to an object; trivial comparisons to NULL or numeric checks on members were not separately listed because they do not change the pointer types. - Calls to other functions (e.g. connection_get_wait) are represented only where a non-const pointer is passed; the callee's prototype (not shown here) must be examined to determine whether const could be used there. Investigate the flagged fragments to determine whether the pointed-to types can be made const, and verify that any called functions/macros accept const-qualified pointers if you change declarations."
