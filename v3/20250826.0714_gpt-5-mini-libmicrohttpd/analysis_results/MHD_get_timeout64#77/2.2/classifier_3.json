  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_timeout64:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_get_timeout64 (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                   uint64_t *timeout64)\n{\n  uint64_t earliest_deadline;\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  struct MHD_Connection *earliest_tmot_conn; /**< the connection with earliest timeout */\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "scenario": "The assignment 'earliest_deadline = 0;' is redundant: earliest_deadline is always assigned a meaningful value before any use (when earliest_tmot_conn is set from normal_timeout_tail or later in the manual-timeout loop, and the comparison using earliest_deadline is short\u2011circuited when earliest_tmot_conn is NULL). Removing this assignment would not change program behaviour (it only mutes a compiler warning), so the operation is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
