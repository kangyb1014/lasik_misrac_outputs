  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is the pointer 'c'. The code only reads members of *c (c->last_activity and c->connection_timeout_ms) and never assigns to 'c' itself or to the pointer value (no statements like 'c = ...', no reassignments, no '&c' used to change it). There are also no assignments to the pointed-to object (no 'c->... = ...') \u2014 only reads and computations using local variables (now, since_actv, timeout, mseconds_left, jump_back), which are allowed. The call to MHD_monotonic_msec_counter() and mhd_assert() do not modify the parameter within this function. Therefore no fragments violate the rule and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
