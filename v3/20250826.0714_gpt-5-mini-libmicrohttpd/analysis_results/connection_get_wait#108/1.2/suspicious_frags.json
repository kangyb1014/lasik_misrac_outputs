  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No GCC/Clang/other vendor keywords or extensions are present (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), labels-as-values (&&label), nested functions, asm volatile, or pragma extensions).\n- All types and macros used (uint64_t, UINT64_MAX) are from standard C (stdint.h macros/types), not compiler extensions.\n- Control-flow constructs, arithmetic on unsigned integers, returns of integer literals, and the function signature are standard C syntax.\n- The only macro call present (mhd_assert) is a user macro; its definition is not shown here, and the call alone does not imply a language extension. If the mhd_assert macro expands to compiler-specific constructs, that expansion is outside the provided fragment and should be checked separately.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments within this function that exhibit explicit compiler language extensions requiring investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
