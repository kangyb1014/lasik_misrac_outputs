  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_get_wait:\n```c\nstatic uint64_t\nconnection_get_wait (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const uint64_t now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const uint64_t since_actv = now - c->last_activity;\n  const uint64_t timeout = c->connection_timeout_ms;\n  uint64_t mseconds_left;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != timeout);\n  /* Keep the next lines in sync with #connection_check_timedout() to avoid\n   * undesired side-effects like busy-waiting. */\n  if (timeout < since_actv)\n  {\n    if (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      { /* Jump back is less than 5 seconds, try to recover. */\n        return 100; /* Set wait time to 0.1 seconds */\n      }\n      /* Too large jump back */\n    }\n    return 0; /* Connection has timed out */\n  }\n  else if (since_actv == timeout)\n  {\n    /* Exact match for timeout and time from last activity.\n     * Maybe this is just a precise match or this happens because the timer\n     * resolution is too low.\n     * Set wait time to 0.1 seconds to avoid busy-waiting with low\n     * timer resolution as connection is not timed-out yet. */\n    return 100;\n  }\n  mseconds_left = timeout - since_actv;\n\n  return mseconds_left;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (timeout < since_actv)\n  {\n    if (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      { /* Jump back is less than 5 seconds, try to recover. */\n        return 100; /* Set wait time to 0.1 seconds */\n      }\n      /* Too large jump back */\n    }\n    return 0; /* Connection has timed out */\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Every executed operation in the fragment can affect the function's return value: the outer if distinguishes timed-out vs not; the inner UINT64_MAX/2 test detects large since_actv (clock wrap), the jump_back compute and 5000 check can cause an early return of 100 (recover), otherwise the function returns 0. There is no statement that is executed but could be removed without changing behaviour (the only inert text is a comment). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
