  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are statically unreachable in this function. Reasoning: \n\n- Entry and basic computations: now, since_actv, and timeout are computed from inputs; since_actv = now - c->last_activity is well-defined for uint64_t and can produce any unsigned value in [0, UINT64_MAX], so subsequent conditionals may all be reachable depending on runtime values.\n\n- Top-level branching: the function distinguishes three mutually exclusive runtime cases and handles each with a reachable branch: (1) timeout < since_actv (handled by the first if), (2) since_actv == timeout (handled by the else if), and (3) since_actv < timeout (falls through to compute timeout - since_actv). None of these branches is statically impossible.\n\n- Inner branch (clock jump handling): when timeout < since_actv and since_actv > UINT64_MAX/2, the code computes jump_back = c->last_activity - now (unsigned wrap) and tests if jump_back <= 5000 to return 100. That path is reachable (wraparound makes small jump_back possible), and the alternative (too large jump back) simply falls through to return 0 \u2014 also reachable.\n\n- Returns and fall-through: all return statements are conditional and reachable; there is no code after an unconditional return that would be unreachable.\n\n- mhd_assert(0 != timeout): this is a diagnostic assertion; if compiled out, the code still behaves correctly (conditions handle timeout==0) and does not create unreachable code.\n\nGiven these points, there are no obvious unreachable code fragments in this function that require further investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
