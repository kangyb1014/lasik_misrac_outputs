  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions. The listed fragments are the only controlling expressions in this function (the assert and all if/else-if conditions) and therefore should be investigated for potential invariance. Other code fragments (variable declarations/assignments, arithmetic expressions, return statements, comments) are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) in this function, so the loop-specific exceptions to the rule do not apply here."
