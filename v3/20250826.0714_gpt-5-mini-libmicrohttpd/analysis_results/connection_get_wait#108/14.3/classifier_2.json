  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment is a function-like macro call, not a selection/iteration controlling expression; moreover the expression (0 != timeout) depends on the local variable timeout (assigned at runtime) and so is not invariant. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not breached. (If, hypothetically, the assert macro expanded to a controlling expression that was a compile-time constant such as if (0) or if (1), that expansion would violate the rule.)"
