  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter already const-qualified in the function is 'const char *str', so it does not require investigation for Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-typed parameters in this function apart from the output parameter(s) listed above. Local variables are scalars (size_t, uint64_t, int) and pointer usage is limited to indexing the already-const 'str' and a null-check; these usages are consistent with the const qualification. Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for potential missing const qualification."
