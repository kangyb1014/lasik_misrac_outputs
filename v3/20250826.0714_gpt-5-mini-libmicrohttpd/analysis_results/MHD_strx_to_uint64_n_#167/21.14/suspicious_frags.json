  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (nor other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) in the provided function. The code performs character-by-character processing via toxdigitvalue(str[i]) and uses an index bounded by maxlen, so it does not compare null-terminated strings using memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: if you want to be thorough, inspect the implementation of the called helper toxdigitvalue (not present here) \u2014 if that helper used memcmp to compare null-terminated strings it would need review; however, within the shown code there is no memcmp usage to report."
