  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Each conditional depends on values that can change at runtime:\n\n- if (! str || ! out_val): depends on the pointer parameters str and out_val provided by the caller \u2014 not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- while (i < maxlen && (digit = toxdigitvalue (str[i])) >= 0): depends on variable i (which is incremented inside the loop), maxlen, and the result of toxdigitvalue(str[i]) (which depends on the contents of str). Because i changes on each iteration and the function result depends on str[i], the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- if ( (res > (UINT64_MAX / 16)) || ((res == (UINT64_MAX / 16)) && ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 16)) ) ): depends on res and digit; res is modified inside the loop, digit is assigned from toxdigitvalue in the loop condition \u2014 not invariant.\n\n- if (i) *out_val = res;: depends on i which was updated in the loop \u2014 not invariant.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). Note: the assignment inside the while controlling expression is deliberate to obtain digit and does not by itself make the expression invariant; it could be examined under other MISRA rules but is not a Rule 14.3 violation here."
