  "explanation": "The only function call present in this function source is toxdigitvalue, invoked in the while condition. That call is the only place that could introduce an indirect recursion path from this function; therefore it should be investigated (i.e. inspect toxdigitvalue and its callees to ensure they do not call back into MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_). Other code fragments (assignments, arithmetic operations, comparisons, casts, pointer checks, returns, use of macros like UINT64_MAX) contain no function calls and thus cannot create direct or indirect self-calls and do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
