  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code fragment. Reasoning: \u2022 The code uses standard C types and macros (size_t, uint64_t, UINT64_MAX) that are defined by the ISO C standard (C99 and later via <stdint.h> / <stddef.h>), not compiler-specific extensions. \u2022 Control constructs and expressions used (while with an assignment in the condition, pointer checks with !, casts like (uint64_t) and (unsigned int)) are standard C features, not extensions. \u2022 There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or other vendor-specific extensions). \u2022 The function toxdigitvalue is a user/provided function reference \u2014 its presence is not a language extension. \u2022 No inline assembly, pragmas, or platform-specific intrinsics are used. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If you have compiler documentation that declares any of the used identifiers as nonstandard for your toolchain, point that out and I will re-evaluate those specific occurrences."
