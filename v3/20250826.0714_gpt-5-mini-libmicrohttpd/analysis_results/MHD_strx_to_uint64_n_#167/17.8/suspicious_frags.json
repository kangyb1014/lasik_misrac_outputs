  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The pointer parameters (str and out_val) themselves are not modified (no statements like str = ..., out_val = ...), and the scalar parameter maxlen is only read. The only write involving a pointer parameter is '*out_val = res;', which modifies the object pointed to by out_val \u2014 this is explicitly permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate the rule and none need further investigation."
