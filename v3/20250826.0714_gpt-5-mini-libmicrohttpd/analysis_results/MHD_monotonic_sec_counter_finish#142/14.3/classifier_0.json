  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression '_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service' is not invariant: it depends on the variable mono_clock_service (which is assigned in the block and can change at runtime). Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated. (A violation would occur only if both sides were compile-time constants or mono_clock_service were an invariant constant.)"
