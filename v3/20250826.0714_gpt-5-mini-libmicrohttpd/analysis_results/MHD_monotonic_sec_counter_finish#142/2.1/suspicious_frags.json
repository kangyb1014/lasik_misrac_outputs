  "explanation": "The rest of the function (the function prototype/definition line, opening/closing braces and comments) are syntactic scaffolding and cannot by themselves create unreachable code, so they do not require investigation. The preprocessor directives that include or exclude the block are compile-time choices (not runtime unreachable code); however, whether the code inside the conditional is reachable depends on build configuration and runtime values of external symbols, so only the fragments listed above warrant further review. No other lines in the provided snippet present constructs that would typically produce unreachable code (e.g. constant false conditionals, return/exit prior to subsequent code, or dead-case labels) within the shown context."
