Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the executable statements and their guarding preprocessor/conditional are potentially subject to dead-code concerns under MISRA C Rule 2.2, so they are reported. The remaining parts of the snippet are not suspicious for dead code: the function declaration and empty-body case (when HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME is not defined) are structural and do not contain executable operations to be removed, braces and comments carry no runtime effect, and the identifier names/constants themselves are declarations/uses but not standalone operations. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for dead-code removal."
