  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME\n  if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n  {\n    mach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n    mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME\n  if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n  {\n    mach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n    mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment conditionally deallocates a Mach port and resets mono_clock_service. This is not dead code: if it executes, removing it would change program behaviour (resource would not be released and mono_clock_service would not be reset). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. (Only if it could be proven that the block is never executed in any build/execution \u2014 e.g. HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME never defined or mono_clock_service is provably always _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV \u2014 would it be considered unreachable; even then that would be unreachable code, not MISRA dead code as defined.)"
