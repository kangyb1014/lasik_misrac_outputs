  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp or any other C standard library string comparison functions are present in the provided function. The code only contains: preprocessor conditional (#ifdef/#endif), a numeric/identifier comparison (if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)), a call to mach_port_deallocate, a call to mach_task_self, and an assignment mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;. There are no char* or string buffers, no calls to memcmp/strcmp/strncmp/strcasecmp, and no operations that compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
