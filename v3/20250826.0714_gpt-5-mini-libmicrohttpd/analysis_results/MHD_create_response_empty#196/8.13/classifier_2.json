  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: &r->mutex is passed to MHD_mutex_init_ to initialize/modify the mutex, so the pointer must refer to a mutable (non-const) object. Rule 8.13 does not require const qualification here. A violation would occur only if the function were declared to accept a pointer-to-const while it actually modifies the mutex."
