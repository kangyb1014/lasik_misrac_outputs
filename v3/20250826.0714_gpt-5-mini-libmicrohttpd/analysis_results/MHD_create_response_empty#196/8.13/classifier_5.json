  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: returning NULL is a null pointer constant and does not affect const-qualification. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that should point to const-qualified objects; this single statement does not make the return type non-const or demonstrate that the pointer should be const. (A violation would occur if the API should have been declared to return 'const struct MHD_Response *' but is declared as non-const, which is not shown by this fragment.)"
