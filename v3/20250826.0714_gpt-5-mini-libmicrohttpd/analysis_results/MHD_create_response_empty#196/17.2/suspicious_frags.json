  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 17.2 concerns self-calls (direct or indirect recursion). Only function calls can introduce recursion. The fragments above include all function calls (and a comment suggesting an alternative function call) present in this function and therefore should be investigated for possible indirect calls back into MHD_create_response_empty. Other code in the function \u2014 variable declarations, assignments (r->fd = -1; r->reference_count = 1; r->flags = flags;), the return statements, and the linkage/storage macro in the function signature \u2014 do not perform function calls and thus cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
