  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario described. The sequence\n\n  mhd_assert (0);\n  return false;\n\nis unreachable if mhd_assert expands to a non\u2011returning failure handler (for example it calls abort() or is declared [[noreturn]]). In that configuration the return statement cannot be executed and therefore is unreachable code, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (a project shall not contain unreachable code). \n\nWhether a violation actually exists depends on the definition/expansion of mhd_assert in the project configuration being analyzed. If mhd_assert is non\u2011returning in the built project then the code contains unreachable code and thus violates Rule 2.1; if mhd_assert is a returning expression (or compiled out) then the return is reachable and there is no violation. To remediate consistently, either remove the redundant return after a known non\u2011returning assert, make the assert return in all configurations, or change the code to avoid placing executable statements after a call that is specified non\u2011returning."
