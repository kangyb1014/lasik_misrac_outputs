  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__large:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__large (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.tiny)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-T' or '--tiny'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.large = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.large = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment 'tool_params.large = ! 0;' stores the constant value 1 into the tool_params.large flag. '! 0' evaluates to 1, so the statement changes program state (enables the 'large' option). Removing this assignment would change program behaviour if any later code reads tool_params.large to decide behaviour, so the statement is not dead code in the shown context. (It would only be a violation of Rule 2.2 if, in the whole project, tool_params.large is never read after this point or is always overwritten before use \u2014 in that specific case the assignment would be removable and thus dead.)"
