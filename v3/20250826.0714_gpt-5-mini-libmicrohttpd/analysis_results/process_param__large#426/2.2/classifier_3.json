  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__large:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__large (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.tiny)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-T' or '--tiny'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.large = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the conditional branch prints an error and returns when tool_params.empty is true, so it is executed in that runtime case and its removal would change program behaviour. (Only if, in the whole project, tool_params.empty can never be true \u2014 e.g. it is always initialized false and never modified \u2014 would this become dead code; no evidence of that is present here.)"
