  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: fprintf is not a <string.h> function covered by Rule 21.17. However, there is a potential runtime fault if param_name does not point to a NUL-terminated char array \u2014 for example, if param_name points to a buffer without a terminating '\\0' (or to a single-char buffer that lacks '\\0'), fprintf(stderr, \"%s\", param_name) will read past the buffer bounds (undefined behavior). That runtime issue is not a breach of Rule 21.17 itself, but is a separate safety/robustness concern."
