  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment uses fprintf with a %s format and does not call any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: if param_name were NULL or not NUL-terminated, fprintf could still read out of bounds, but that concern is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 which specifically targets functions from <string.h>.)"
