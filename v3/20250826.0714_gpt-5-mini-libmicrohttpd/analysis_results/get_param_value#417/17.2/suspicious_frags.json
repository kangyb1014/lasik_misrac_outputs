  "explanation": "There is no direct call to get_param_value within this function, so no obvious direct recursion. The remaining statements (pointer assignments, conditional checks, indexing of value_str, returns, and enum handling) do not perform function calls or indirect invocation that could cause recursion and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. The only function calls in this fragment are the two listed above; they are the only places where an indirect recursive call chain could originate and so should be investigated further if needed."
