  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: \n- The outer branch if (0 != param_tail[0]) has both outcomes reachable depending on the contents of param_tail; the inner branch if ('=' != param_tail[0]) likewise has both outcomes reachable. \n- value_str is assigned either from param_tail / param_tail+1 or from next_param; the path where value_str is NULL (next_param == NULL and param_tail[0] == '\\0') is reachable, so the else of if (NULL != value_str) is reachable. \n- The check if ((0 == digits) || (0 != value_str[digits])) is well-formed with respect to short-circuit evaluation: when digits == 0 the left operand is true and the right operand (which would dereference value_str) is not evaluated, so there is no unreachable statement there. When digits > 0, value_str must be non-NULL (because digits is only set >0 when value_str != NULL), so value_str[digits] is valid to evaluate. \n- The final two return statements are both reachable: the function returns PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR when param_tail[0] != 0, otherwise PERF_RPL_PARAM_STR_PLUS_NEXT. \n\nNote: There are other potential issues (for example, dereferencing param_tail without a NULL check if param_tail were NULL), but those are not instances of unreachable code and thus are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 investigation requested here."
