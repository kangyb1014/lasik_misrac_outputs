  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is an invariant constant. Each conditional depends on function inputs or computed values, so none appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3: \n\n- if (0 != param_tail[0]) and the nested if ('=' != param_tail[0]) depend on the runtime contents of param_tail. They are not compile-time constants.\n- value_str is assigned from param_tail, param_tail + 1, or next_param; the test if (NULL != value_str) depends on those inputs and the preceding assignment, so it is not invariant.\n- digits is computed by mhd_tool_str_to_uint (or set to 0 when value_str is NULL); the combined condition if ((0 == digits) || (0 != value_str[digits])) depends on that runtime result (and short-circuit evaluation prevents dereference when value_str is NULL and digits == 0).\n- The final if (0 != param_tail[0]) again depends on param_tail contents and is not a constant expression.\n\nAlso, there are no loops with constant controlling expressions (no infinite-loop or do-while constant-false exceptions apply). Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
