  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_param_value:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nget_param_value (const char *param_name, const char *param_tail,\n                 const char *next_param, unsigned int *param_value)\n{\n  const char *value_str;\n  size_t digits;\n  if (0 != param_tail[0])\n  {\n    if ('=' != param_tail[0])\n      value_str = param_tail;\n    else\n      value_str = param_tail + 1;\n  }\n  else\n    value_str = next_param;\n\n  if (NULL != value_str)\n    digits = mhd_tool_str_to_uint (value_str, param_value);\n  else\n    digits = 0;\n\n  if ((0 == digits) || (0 != value_str[digits]))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' is not followed by valid number.\\n\",\n             param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n\n  if (0 != param_tail[0])\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR;\n\n  return PERF_RPL_PARAM_STR_PLUS_NEXT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 != param_tail[0])\n  {\n    if ('=' != param_tail[0])\n      value_str = param_tail;\n    else\n      value_str = param_tail + 1;\n  }\n  else\n    value_str = next_param;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: each assignment to value_str is reachable and affects subsequent behaviour. The branch if (0 != param_tail[0]) distinguishes whether the first char is NUL; inside it the '=' check decides between value_str = param_tail and value_str = param_tail + 1; the else assigns value_str = next_param. Removing any of these assignments would change the value of value_str and therefore program behaviour (the value_str is later used). There is no operation here that is executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
