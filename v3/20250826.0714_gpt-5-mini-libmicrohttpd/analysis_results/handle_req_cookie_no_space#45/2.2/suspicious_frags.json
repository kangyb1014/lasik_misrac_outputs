  "explanation": "No code fragments in this function appear to be dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Reasoning by statement:\n- The declaration 'unsigned int err_code;' is not an executed operation (declarations alone are not considered dead code).\n- The call and assignment 'err_code = get_no_space_err_status_code(...)' produces a value that is subsequently used; removing it would change program behaviour unless the call has no side effects and its result is unused \u2014 but the result is passed to the next call, so it is used.\n- The call 'transmit_error_response_static (c, err_code, ...)' has an observable side effect (transmitting an error response); removing it would change behaviour.\n- The function itself is declared static; if it were never referenced elsewhere in the project it would be unreachable (not callable). Per the rule notes unreachable code is not classified as dead code (dead code is executed but removable without changing behaviour). Whether an unused static function exists elsewhere in the project is outside the scope of this fragment.\nTherefore there are no executed operations within this function that could be removed without affecting program behaviour; no fragments in this snippet need investigation for Rule 2.2."
