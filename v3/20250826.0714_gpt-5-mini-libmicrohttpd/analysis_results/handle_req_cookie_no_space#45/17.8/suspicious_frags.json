  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter (struct MHD_Connection *c). The code does not assign to or otherwise modify the parameter identifier c (no statements like c = ...). It only passes c to other functions and does not dereference or reassign the pointer within this function. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule; there is no evidence here of modifying the pointer itself. There are no other parameters or statements in this function that would raise Rule 17.8 concerns, so no fragments require further investigation."
