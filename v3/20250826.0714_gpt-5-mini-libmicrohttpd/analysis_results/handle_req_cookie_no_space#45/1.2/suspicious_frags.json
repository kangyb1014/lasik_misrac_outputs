  "explanation": "I examined the entire function. It uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, a pointer parameter of type struct MHD_Connection, a local unsigned int, the NULL macro, and two ordinary function calls (get_no_space_err_status_code and transmit_error_response_static) with ordinary argument lists. There are no compiler-specific extensions visible (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, anonymous structs/unions, or other vendor-specific tokens). Based on the provided snippet, there are no language extensions that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
