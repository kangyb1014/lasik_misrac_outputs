  "explanation": "No other fragments in the provided function can produce unreachable code: the only local declaration is a simple unsigned int, there are no conditional branches, labels, gotos, early returns, or code following the last statement within this function. The function body consists solely of the two call expressions and the variable; therefore any unreachable-code concerns must stem from the items listed above (e.g. dead/unreferenced static function or non-returning behavior of called routines). No additional fragments in this snippet need investigation."
