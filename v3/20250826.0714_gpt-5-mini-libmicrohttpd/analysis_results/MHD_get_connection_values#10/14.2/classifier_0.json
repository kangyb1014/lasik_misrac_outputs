  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_connection_values:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_connection_values (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                           enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                           MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator,\n                           void *iterator_cls)\n{\n  int ret;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return -1;\n  ret = 0;\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    if (0 != (pos->kind & kind))\n    {\n      ret++;\n      if ( (NULL != iterator) &&\n           (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                                pos->kind,\n                                pos->header,\n                                pos->value)) )\n        return ret;\n    }\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\npos = connection->rq.headers_received\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment pos = connection->rq.headers_received is the initialization clause of the for loop and sets the loop counter (pos). In the full loop the second clause tests pos, and the third clause (pos = pos->next) modifies only the loop counter. The loop body does not modify pos or connection->rq.headers_received, and the called iterator function is passed pos members (not pos itself), so there is no persistent side effect on the loop counter. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated. (A violating scenario would be if the initialization used or the loop body modified objects other than the single loop counter, or if a called function could modify pos or headers_received.)"
