  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect recursion. In this function the only call site that could cause indirect recursion is the invocation of the callback function pointer (iterator). No other function calls or references in this fragment invoke external code that could lead to recursion. Declarations (local variables 'ret', 'pos'), the NULL check of 'connection', the loop over headers, the increment of 'ret' and the final 'return ret' are local operations that cannot by themselves cause the function to call itself. Therefore only the callback declaration and the callback invocation need to be investigated for potential indirect recursive calls; the remaining code fragments are not relevant to Rule 17.2."
