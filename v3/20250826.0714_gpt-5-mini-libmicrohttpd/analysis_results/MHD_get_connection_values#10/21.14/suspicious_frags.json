  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in this function. The code contains only pointer/null checks (NULL == connection, NULL != pos), a bitmask test (0 != (pos->kind & kind)), integer comparisons/returns, and a single call to the provided iterator function. There are no calls to memcmp (or other string-comparison library functions) here; any string handling/comparison would occur inside the iterator callback, which is outside this function and not part of the supplied code. Therefore there are no in-function fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
