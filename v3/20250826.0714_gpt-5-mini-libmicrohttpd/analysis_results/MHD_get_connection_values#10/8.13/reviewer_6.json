It could and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type, e.g. 'const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos', so the current code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the shown function the local loop variable pos is only used to read fields (pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value, pos->next) and is never used to modify the structure. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible; declaring pos as\n\n  const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\nwould satisfy the rule. The assignment from connection->rq.headers_received (a non-const pointer) to a const-qualified pointer is permitted (adding const), and using pos->next (a struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header * value) and assigning it back to pos would also implicitly convert to const, so there is no blocker in the code shown. Therefore the reported violation is correct."
