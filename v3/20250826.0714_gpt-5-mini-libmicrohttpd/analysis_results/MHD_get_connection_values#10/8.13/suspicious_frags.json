  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not declare or pass pointer types whose const-qualification could be tightened. Examples: the function return type and storage-class specifier, the local integer ret, the NULL checks, the bitwise test of pos->kind with kind, the incrementing of ret, and the return statements are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. The flagged fragments include all places where pointers are declared, assigned, or passed to another function in this function and thus merit review to determine if they should point to const-qualified types."
