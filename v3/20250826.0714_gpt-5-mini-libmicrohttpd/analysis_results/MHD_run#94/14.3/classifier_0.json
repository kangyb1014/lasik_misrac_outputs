  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) appears to be a predicate on the daemon object and, if it expands to an expression that depends on the daemon state (e.g. reading a field or flag), it is not invariant and does not violate Rule 14.3. A specific violation scenario would be if the macro expands to a compile-time constant (for example, #define MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(d) 0 or #define MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(d) 1) or otherwise to an expression that does not depend on the daemon argument; in that case the controlling expression would be invariant and Rule 14.3 would be violated."
