  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: (daemon->shutdown) is a run-time read of a structure member, not a compile-time constant, so the controlling expression is not invariant. (It would only violate Rule 14.3 if daemon->shutdown were in fact an integer constant expression or otherwise guaranteed invariant.)"
