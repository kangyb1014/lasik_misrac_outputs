  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in general: the if-condition depends on runtime state (daemon->shutdown or the result of MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon)), so the return is not provably always taken and the subsequent code is reachable. A specific violation scenario would be if MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) is a preprocessor macro that expands to a compile-time constant true (for example defined as 1) or if daemon->shutdown is guaranteed true for all daemon instances; in that build/configuration the if always succeeds and the later code (the call to MHD_run_wait and return MHD_YES) would be unreachable."
