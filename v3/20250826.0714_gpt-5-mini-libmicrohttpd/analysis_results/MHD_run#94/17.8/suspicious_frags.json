  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter identifier 'daemon'. The code only reads members (daemon->shutdown), passes the pointer to other functions/macros (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon), MHD_run_wait(daemon, 0)) and does not perform any assignment to 'daemon' or alter the pointer itself. Passing the pointer and allowing modification of the pointed-to object is permitted by Rule 17.8, so there are no violations to investigate in this function."
