First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. There are no explicit for, while, or do-while loop statements in this function, so no plain-language for-loop fragments exist to inspect. However, macros or function-like macros used here could expand to loop constructs; therefore the macro/function invocation sites are listed so their definitions can be inspected for any concealed for loops: mhd_assert occurrences, mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, and ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE. Other code in the function (variable declaration, the conditional structure, and the return statements themselves) do not contain for loops and need not be investigated further unless the macros they invoke (the listed fragments) expand into loops."
