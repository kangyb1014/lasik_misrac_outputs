  "explanation": "No calls to any of the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in this function. The function only uses assertions, pointer-difference helpers (mp_ptr_diff_), pointer-order check (mp_ptr_le_), and a rounding macro (ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE). The pointer arithmetic is guarded by asserts that check block != NULL, block_offset bounds, and pool->size >= block_offset + block_size, and there is an explicit check of block being within pool->memory. Therefore there are no direct uses of string.h functions to examine for out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. If any of the called macros/functions (mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, or mhd_assert) were to internally invoke string.h functions, those expansions should be inspected, but nothing in this function text itself matches the set of string.h calls covered by Rule 21.17."
