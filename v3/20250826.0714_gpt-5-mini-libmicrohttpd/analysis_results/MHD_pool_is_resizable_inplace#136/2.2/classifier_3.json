Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                               void *block,\n                               size_t block_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (block != NULL || block_size == 0);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_size);\n  if (NULL != block)\n  {\n    const size_t block_offset = mp_ptr_diff_ (block, pool->memory);\n    mhd_assert (mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, block));\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset);\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset + block_size);\n    return (pool->pos ==\n            ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (block_offset + block_size));\n  }\n  return false; /* Unallocated blocks cannot be resized in-place */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->size >= block_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment is an assertion checking a runtime precondition (mhd_assert(pool->size >= block_size)). This is not dead code in general because its execution can affect program behaviour (it may abort or log on failure); removing it could change observable behaviour if the condition can fail at runtime. It would only be dead if the assertion macro is defined as a no-op in the build and the asserted condition is either provably true or has no side effects \u2014 in that case the statement has no effect and could be removed without changing behaviour."
