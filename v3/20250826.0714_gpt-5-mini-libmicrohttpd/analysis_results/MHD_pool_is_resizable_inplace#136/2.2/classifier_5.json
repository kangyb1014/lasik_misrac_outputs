Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                               void *block,\n                               size_t block_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (block != NULL || block_size == 0);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_size);\n  if (NULL != block)\n  {\n    const size_t block_offset = mp_ptr_diff_ (block, pool->memory);\n    mhd_assert (mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, block));\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset);\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset + block_size);\n    return (pool->pos ==\n            ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (block_offset + block_size));\n  }\n  return false; /* Unallocated blocks cannot be resized in-place */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The statement mhd_assert(pool->end >= pool->pos); is a runtime check of an invariant; its presence can change program behaviour (e.g. by reporting or aborting on violation). Therefore it is not \"dead code\" under Rule 2.2. Only if it could be proven that the condition is always true in all executions (so the assertion never affects behaviour) would the assertion be dead \u2014 but no such proof is available from the snippet."
