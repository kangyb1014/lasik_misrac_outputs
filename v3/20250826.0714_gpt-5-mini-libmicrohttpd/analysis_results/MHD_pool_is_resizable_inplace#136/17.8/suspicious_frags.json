  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: 'struct MemoryPool *pool', 'void *block', and 'size_t block_size'. There are no assignments to any of these identifiers (no statements like 'pool = ...', 'block = ...', or 'block_size = ...'), so the pointer variables themselves are not changed. Accesses such as 'pool->pos', 'pool->size' and other member reads refer to the object pointed to by 'pool' (modifying the pointed-to object would be allowed by Rule 17.8, and in this code there are only reads and assertions). The call to mp_ptr_diff_(block, pool->memory) and the macros ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE and mhd_assert are used in expressions and return values; they do not assign to the parameter variables in the shown code. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
