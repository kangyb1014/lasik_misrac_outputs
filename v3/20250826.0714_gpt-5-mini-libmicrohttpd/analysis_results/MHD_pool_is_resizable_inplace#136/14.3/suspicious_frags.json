  "explanation": "No selection or iteration controlling expressions in this function are invariant, so there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\nReasons:\n- The only explicit controlling statement is if (NULL != block). This depends on the runtime value of the parameter block and is not an invariant constant expression.\n- There are no loops (for, while, do-while) in the function. The rule\u2019s allowed exceptions for infinite loops or a do-while with a constant false expression do not apply because no loops are present.\n- The return statement inside the if evaluates an equality expression and is not a controlling expression of a selection/iteration statement; it therefore is outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\n- The mhd_assert(...) invocations are assertions, not explicit selection/iteration statements in the source. Even if the macro expands to an if(...) in some build configurations, the asserted expressions reference function parameters and structure members (e.g., pool->end >= pool->pos) and are not constant/invariant literal expressions; they are runtime checks rather than compile-time invariant controlling expressions.\n\nGiven the above, there are no suspicious controlling expressions to report for investigation under Rule 14.3."
