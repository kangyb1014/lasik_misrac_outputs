  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appear in the provided code. The function only performs pointer/size assertions, null checks and arithmetic (mhd_assert, mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE) and returns a boolean based on size/offset comparisons. None of these operations involve comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp, so there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
