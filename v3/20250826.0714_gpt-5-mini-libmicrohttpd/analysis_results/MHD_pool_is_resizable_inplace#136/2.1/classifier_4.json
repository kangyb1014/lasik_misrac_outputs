  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the assertion mhd_assert(block != NULL || block_size == 0) does not by itself create unreachable code. The condition is not a compile-time constant and (as typically implemented) the assert either checks at run-time or compiles to nothing in release builds, so it does not make any subsequent branch impossible to reach. A violation of Rule 2.1 would only occur if the macro expanded to an unconditional control transfer (for example, if mhd_assert were incorrectly defined to always return, goto, or otherwise unconditionally abort execution regardless of the condition), which would make code after the macro unreachable \u2014 but that is not the normal/expected definition of mhd_assert here."
