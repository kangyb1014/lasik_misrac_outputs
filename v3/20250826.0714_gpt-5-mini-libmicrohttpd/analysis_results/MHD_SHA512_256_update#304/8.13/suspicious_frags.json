  "explanation": "Most of the function already uses const qualification where appropriate (the input parameter is declared as const uint8_t *data) or necessarily works with mutable state (ctx is modified, ctx->H and count fields are updated), so those locations do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. Pointer arithmetic and modification of the local pointer variable 'data' is intentional for buffer traversal and does not imply the pointed-to type lacks const where it should. The flagged fragments are the only places in this function that (a) perform casts that may remove const qualification from a buffer pointer and (b) call the transform function with buffer/data pointers where the target function prototype\u2019s const-qualification should be checked. All other lines either operate on mutable context state or already use const-qualified pointee types and therefore do not need further inspection for Rule 8.13."
