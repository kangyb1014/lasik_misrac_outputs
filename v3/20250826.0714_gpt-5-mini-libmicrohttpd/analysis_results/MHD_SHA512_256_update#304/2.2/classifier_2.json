  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_SHA512_256_update:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_SHA512_256_update (struct Sha512_256Ctx *ctx,\n                       const uint8_t *data,\n                       size_t length)\n{\n  unsigned int bytes_have; /**< Number of bytes in the context buffer */\n  uint64_t count_hi; /**< The high part to be moved to another variable */\n\n  mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0));\n\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  if (0 == length)\n    return; /* Shortcut, do nothing */\n#endif /* !

  "scenario": "When SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 7 and an addition of length to ctx->count wraps (for example ctx->count = SIZE_MAX - 4 and length = 10, so after ctx->count += length the new ctx->count is 5 and length (10) > ctx->count (5) is true), the if-body executes and increments ctx->count_bits_hi. Removing that operation would change the program behaviour for such wrap conditions. Therefore this fragment is not dead code."
