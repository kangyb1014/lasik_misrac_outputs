  "explanation": "Only function calls can produce direct or indirect recursion back into new_connections_list_process_. The most likely recursion sources here are the explicit per-connection processing and any list-manipulation routine that might invoke callbacks: new_connection_process_ (application-level handling of a connection) and DLL_remove (which may invoke user callbacks or other code). I also included the mutex lock/unlock calls because platform/threading primitives or their checked wrappers sometimes invoke diagnostics or callbacks in unusual builds; they should be inspected to ensure they do not call back into the daemon's connection-processing path.\n\nOther fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: simple assignments and pointer updates (e.g. local_head = daemon->new_connections_head; local_tail = daemon->new_connections_tail; daemon->new_connections_head = NULL; daemon->new_connections_tail = NULL; daemon->have_new = false; (void) local_head; c = local_tail; mhd_assert(...) and the loop/control constructs) do not call functions and therefore cannot cause direct or indirect recursion. Diagnostic macros like mhd_assert and MHD_D_IS_THREAD_SAFE_ are compile-time or lightweight checks and are not expected to invoke application control flow that would re-enter new_connections_list_process_; similarly, the logging call (MHD_DLOG) is a simple logging statement and is unlikely to call back into the connection-processing path. These non-call operations therefore do not need further investigation for potential self-calls under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
