  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function. It contains only pointer assignments, assertions, mutex lock/unlock, linked-list manipulation (DLL_remove), a call to new_connection_process_, and conditional logging macros. There are no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), nor are there any direct string/byte-buffer manipulations or pointer arithmetic on character buffers in this snippet that could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to those functions. The only external identifiers that might perform such operations are DLL_remove and new_connection_process_, but their implementations are not present in this fragment; they would need to be reviewed separately if available. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
