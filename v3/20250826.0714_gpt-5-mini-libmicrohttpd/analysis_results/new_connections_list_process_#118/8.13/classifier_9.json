  "scenario": "No rule violation can be determined from this fragment alone. The call new_connection_process_(daemon, c) passes two mutable pointers; that is acceptable if the function intends to modify the daemon or connection. Rule 8.13 would be violated only if new_connection_process_ does not modify either object but its prototype uses non-const pointee types. For example, if new_connection_process_ were declared as\n\n    int new_connection_process_(struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, struct MHD_Connection *c);\n\nbut the function does not modify *daemon or *c, then both parameters should be declared as const-qualified pointee types (const struct MHD_Daemon * and/or const struct MHD_Connection *) and the current non-const declarations would violate Rule 8.13."
