  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 14.3 concern is whether the loop controlling expression is invariant. The do-while loop and the surrounding code that initializes local_tail and calls DLL_remove are the relevant places to inspect: local_tail is assigned from daemon->new_connections_tail and then used as the loop control; DLL_remove is the operation expected to update the list (and thus local_tail). Those fragments are therefore reported for investigation. Other fragments in the function (mutex lock/unlock calls, assertions, (void) local_head; mute, logging, variable declarations and the call to new_connection_process_) are not controlling expressions themselves and do not by themselves create an invariant controlling expression, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.3 compliance."
