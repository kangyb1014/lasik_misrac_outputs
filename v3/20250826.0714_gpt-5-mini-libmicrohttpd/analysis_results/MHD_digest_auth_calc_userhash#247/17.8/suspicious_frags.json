  "explanation": "I inspected all parameter uses in the function. No function parameter is assigned or re\u2011assigned anywhere in the body (there are no statements like username = ..., realm = ..., userhash_bin = ..., algo3 = ..., or bin_buf_size = ...). The pointer parameters username and realm are declared const char * so they cannot be modified; they are only read (passed to strlen and to calc_userhash). The void * userhash_bin is passed to calc_userhash which may modify the object pointed to (this is allowed by the rule) but the pointer itself is not modified. The scalar parameters algo3 and bin_buf_size are passed by value and not altered. All other operations use local variables (struct DigestAlgorithm da, ret) or call functions; none modify the parameter identifiers themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
