  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function are not reported because they are basic, necessary elements and are unlikely to be dead code by themselves: the function signature and local variable declarations are required for the API and for holding state; the final \"return ret;\" is the function result and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the conditional structure (the if/else that guards calculation based on buffer size) represents intended control flow rather than an executed-but-redundant operation; and the strlen calls are used as parameters to calc_userhash (so they are not standalone, removable operations). Initialization and de-initialization calls are reported where they may warrant inspection, but other single-line declarations and the overall control-flow constructs are essential to correct behaviour and therefore were not flagged."
