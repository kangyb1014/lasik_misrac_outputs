  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 algo3,\n                               const char *username,\n                               const char *realm,\n                               void *userhash_bin,\n                               size_t bin_buf_size)\n{\n  struct DigestAlgorithm da;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  if (! digest_init_one_time (&da, get_base_digest_algo (algo3)))\n    return MHD_NO;\n  if (digest_get_size (&da) > bin_buf_size)\n    ret = MHD_NO;\n  else\n  {\n    calc_userhash (&da,\n                   username,\n                   strlen (username),\n                   realm,\n                   strlen (realm),\n                   userhash_bin);\n    ret = MHD_YES;\n\n#ifdef MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR\n    if (digest_ext_error (&da))\n      ret = MHD_NO;\n#endif /* MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR */\n  }\n  digest_deinit (&da);\n\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nret = MHD_YES;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment ret = MHD_YES; is executed and establishes the default return value for the else-branch. If MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR is defined it may be overwritten by ret = MHD_NO; otherwise it is returned as set. Removing the assignment would either change the function behaviour or leave ret uninitialized (undefined behaviour), so the operation is not dead code."
