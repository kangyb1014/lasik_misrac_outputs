  "explanation": "Only the uses of <string.h> functions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. In this snippet the only direct string.h function calls are the two strlen expressions (and they appear as arguments in the calc_userhash call), so those are reported for investigation. Other lines (digest_init_one_time, get_base_digest_algo, digest_get_size, the bin_buf_size comparison, digest_deinit, and the optional digest_ext_error branch) do not call string.h functions and therefore are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17. The bin size check (digest_get_size(&da) > bin_buf_size) addresses buffer size for the produced binary hash (subject to verifying userhash_bin is non-NULL elsewhere), but it does not involve string.h usage and thus need not be flagged under this rule."
