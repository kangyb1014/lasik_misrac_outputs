  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in this function that modify any of the function parameters themselves (pool, block, block_size). Observations supporting this conclusion:\n- There are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like pool = ..., block = ..., or block_size = ...).\n- The code modifies members of the object pointed to by pool (e.g., pool->pos, pool->end). Per the rule text, modifying the object referenced by a pointer parameter is allowed; only reassignment of the pointer variable itself is forbidden.\n- The code calls functions (memset, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) that modify the memory pointed to by block; again, this modifies the pointed-to object, not the pointer parameter variable.\n- All other uses of parameters are reads or are passed by value to macros/functions. The macros (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_) are used in expressions and do not reassign the parameters within this function.\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
