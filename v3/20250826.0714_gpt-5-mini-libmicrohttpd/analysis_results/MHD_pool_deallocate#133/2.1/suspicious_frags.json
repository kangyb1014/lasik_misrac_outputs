  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are most likely to hide statically unreachable code paths or to introduce code that cannot be reached under some compilation/runtime configurations: (1) the preprocessor-guarded \"else return;\" (zero-size case) creates an early return in certain compile configurations and therefore may make following code unreachable for that configuration/condition; (2) the entire \"alg_end == pool->pos\" branch (including the ASAN-specific nested preprocessor/conditional code) contains multiple mutually exclusive preprocessor branches and nested conditionals that can produce compiled but never-executed code paths depending on macro definitions; (3) the \"allocated from the end\" else-branch contains assertions and conditions that, together with other invariants, may make it unreachable in some scenarios. These fragments should be investigated for Rule 2.1.\n\nWhy other fragments are not flagged: the remaining code consists of runtime-dependent conditionals and mhd_assert checks (which are diagnostic and may be compiled out), pointer arithmetic, and standard control flow that can be reached for some legitimate input/state combinations. There are no other obvious statically unreachable statements (e.g. code following an unconditional return, or code behind mutually exclusive compile-time macros that make it impossible to compile) beyond the fragments reported. Therefore those parts need not be investigated for unreachable-code concerns under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
