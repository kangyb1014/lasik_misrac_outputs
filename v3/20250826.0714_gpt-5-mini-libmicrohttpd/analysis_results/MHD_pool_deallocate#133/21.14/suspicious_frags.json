  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function there are no calls to memcmp (nor to strcmp/strncmp) \u2014 only calls to memset and project-specific macros/ASAN helpers (_MHD_POISON_MEMORY, ROUND_TO_ALIGN*, __asan_region_is_poisoned, __asan_address_is_poisoned). All comparisons in the code are numeric/pointer comparisons (e.g. block_offset <= pool->pos, alg_end == pool->pos) and relate to sizes/offsets, not string content. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that match the rule and need investigation. Note: macros used here are not expanded in the snippet; if any macro definition (not shown) invoked memcmp, that would be outside the visible code and should be checked separately \u2014 but within the provided code itself there is no memcmp usage to inspect."
