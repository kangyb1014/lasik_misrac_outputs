  "explanation": "No pointer in this function appears to be a candidate for adding const qualification. The function parameters are: (1) struct MemoryPool *pool \u2014 the function modifies pool (pool->pos, pool->end) and manipulates pool->memory contents via poisoning/zeroing, so pool and pool->memory must be non-const; (2) void *block \u2014 the function writes to the memory pointed to by block (memset and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY), so block must be a non-const pointer. Other pointer uses (e.g. passing pool->memory + alg_start to ASAN query functions) are read-only, but they rely on pool->memory being writable elsewhere in this code path, so the underlying pointer cannot be safely made const here. There are no other pointer variables declared in this function that could be const-qualified. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13."
