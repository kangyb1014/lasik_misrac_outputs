  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are most likely to hide unreachable-code issues or indicate problematic/intentional always-true/never-taken constructs:\n\n- The explicit switch case labeled MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP has a comment stating it \"should never happen\"; this is a code path that the author believes to be unreachable and therefore should be investigated for actual reachability.\n\n- The #if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT) block contains an unconditional if (1) surrounding the code. An always-true conditional is suspicious (possibly a leftover from debugging or a miswritten condition) and can mask intended conditions or produce unreachable alternatives; it warrants inspection.\n\n- The #ifndef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE block first casts away fd_setsize with (void) and immediately assigns to fd_setsize afterwards. This pattern is odd and could hide unreachable/unused code or a mistaken attempt to silence warnings; it should be reviewed.\n\n- The debug block guarded by #if _MHD_DEBUG_CONNECT closes with a mismatched comment on the #endif (\"HTTPS_SUPPORT && UPGRADE_SUPPORT\"), which may indicate preprocessor conditional misnesting in the broader file. Misnested/incorrect preprocessor directives can easily produce code that is never compiled or unintentionally unreachable depending on configuration; this deserves investigation.\n\nWhy other fragments were not selected:\n- Ordinary conditional branches (e.g. if (daemon->shutdown) return ..., the itc/listen-socket handling, and the loops over connections) express normal runtime control flow and are potentially reachable depending on runtime state; there is no clear evidence in the snippet that any of those paths are statically unreachable.\n\n- Preprocessor-gated blocks such as the MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS / MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS sections are platform-specific and not inherently unreachable; their reachability depends on build configuration rather than being dead code in all configurations.\n\n- The repeated uses of MHD_add_to_fd_set_ and the ls bookkeeping, while potentially suspicious for logic errors, do not contain explicit constructs (e.g. always-false conditions, code after unconditional return, or mutually exclusive conditions that guarantee a branch is never taken) that would definitively constitute unreachable code without further context.\n\nIf you want, I can expand the investigation to show specific control-flow scenarios that could make other parts unreachable (e.g. particular macro configurations or enum value constraints), but the four fragments above are the most immediate candidates for MISRA Rule 2.1 review."
