  "scenario": "The local pointer 'entry' is only used to read fields (entry->username) and is not used to modify the UserEntry. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, this pointer should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry') so that the pointed-to object is treated as read-only. To fully comply the function's return type should also be changed to 'const struct UserEntry *' (or otherwise ensure callers do not need a mutable pointer)."
