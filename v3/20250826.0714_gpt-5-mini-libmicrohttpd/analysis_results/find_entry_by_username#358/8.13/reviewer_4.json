Since the function does not modify the returned object, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type. If user_ids is intended to be read-only (e.g. declared const struct UserEntry user_ids[]), returning struct UserEntry * allows callers to modify those entries and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The correct form would be to use const struct UserEntry *entry and return const struct UserEntry *.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not definitively correct as stated. Whether this is a MISRA 8.13 violation depends on the wider context (the declaration and intended mutability of user_ids). If user_ids is declared const (or the entries are intended to be read-only) then assigning/returning a plain struct UserEntry * that points into that array would be wrong (you would be discarding const qualification) and MISRA 8.13 would require using pointers to const. Even if user_ids is non-const, the function does not modify the entries and so it would be possible (and preferred by 8.13) to declare the local pointer and the function return type as const struct UserEntry *. However, from the single function shown we cannot prove a rule violation: if user_ids is a mutable array and callers are intended to be able to modify the returned entry, the current signature is acceptable. Recommendation: if entries are read-only, change the prototype and local pointer to const struct UserEntry * (and return that); if callers must modify entries, keep the current signature."
