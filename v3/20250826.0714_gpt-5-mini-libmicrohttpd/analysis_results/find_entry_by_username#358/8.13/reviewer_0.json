Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, this pointer should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry') so that the pointed-to object is treated as read-only. To fully comply the function's return type should also be changed to 'const struct UserEntry *' (or otherwise ensure callers do not need a mutable pointer).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct: the local pointer 'entry' is used only to read the UserEntry and therefore, per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry'). In the current code the pointer is non-const and so the rule is violated. Note the practical consequence: because the function returns that pointer, making the local pointer const would force a change to the function signature (to return 'const struct UserEntry *') or require an unsafe cast that would discard const. The correct remediation is to make the pointed-to objects and the API const if callers do not need to modify the entries (e.g. declare the array and the function to return const pointers). If callers must be able to modify the returned object, then the pointer cannot be const and the current code is acceptable \u2014 but that would mean Rule 8.13 is not applicable in that design. Given the code as shown (local pointer only used for reading), agent A\u2019s identification of a Rule 8.13 violation is valid."
