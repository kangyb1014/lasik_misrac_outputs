  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter. The parameter is declared as const char *const username, which makes both the pointed-to characters and the pointer itself const inside the function. The function only reads username (passes it to strcmp) and never assigns to username or writes through it. All assignments in the function are to local variables (size_t i and struct UserEntry *entry) or to entry (entry = user_ids + i), which do not affect the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
