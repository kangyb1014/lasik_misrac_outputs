  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function is statically unreachable. Reasoning: \n- There are no statements located after an unconditional return in the same block; the only return inside the loop is conditional (guarded by the strcmp result), so subsequent loop iterations and the final return NULL remain potentially reachable. \n- The loop has a compile-time evaluated bound (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); even if that bound is zero the loop body is simply skipped and the final return NULL is executed (reachable). \n- There are no infinite loops, unconditional goto/jump targets, or conditional expressions that are constant true/false here that would make any statement unreachable. \n- Declarations and assignments (e.g., struct UserEntry *entry; entry = user_ids + i;) are executed each iteration and are not unreachable.\n\nNotes (not related to Rule 2.1/unreachability): there are other potential concerns (e.g., passing a NULL username to strcmp, or misuse of sizeof if user_ids is actually a pointer in another translation unit), but these are not instances of unreachable code and therefore need not be investigated under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
