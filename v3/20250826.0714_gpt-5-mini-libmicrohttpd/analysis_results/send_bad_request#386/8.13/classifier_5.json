  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the expression casts BAD_REQUEST_PAGE to type 'const void *', so the pointer produced is to a const-qualified type. Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible; the fragment adds const qualification. (If BAD_REQUEST_PAGE were later modified through a non-const alias or declared non-const and intended to be mutable, that would indicate a design issue \u2014 the proper fix would be to declare BAD_REQUEST_PAGE as const \u2014 but the shown cast itself does not violate Rule 8.13.)"
