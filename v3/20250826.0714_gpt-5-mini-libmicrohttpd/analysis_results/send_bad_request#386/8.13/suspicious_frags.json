  "explanation": "I flagged all pointer declarations and uses in this function since Rule 8.13 concerns pointer targets that could/should be const-qualified. Other parts of the snippet were not flagged because they are not pointer types (enum MHD_Result ret), are simple scalar expressions (strlen(BAD_REQUEST_PAGE)), or are calls/operations that either use the pointers already listed or likely require mutable pointers by API contract. No additional code fragments in this function involve pointers that could be const-qualified, so they do not need further investigation."
