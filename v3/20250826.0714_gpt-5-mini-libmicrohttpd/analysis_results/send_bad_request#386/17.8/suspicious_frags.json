  "explanation": "No code fragments modify any function parameter. The only parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *con' and it is only passed by value to MHD_queue_response; it is not reassigned or altered in this function. Local variables (res, ret) are used and assigned locally. The cast of BAD_REQUEST_PAGE and the strlen call do not affect function parameters. Note: functions called (e.g., MHD_queue_response) may modify the object pointed to by 'con' (which is permitted by Rule 17.8), but the pointer parameter itself is not modified here, so no fragments need investigation for this rule."
