  "scenario": "No violation: send_bad_request calls MHD_destroy_response, which is a different function. Rule 17.2 would only be violated if MHD_destroy_response (directly or indirectly) called send_bad_request (or itself), creating recursion; there is no evidence of that in the provided code fragment."
