  "explanation": "There is no direct call to send_bad_request within this function (no occurrence of send_bad_request(...)), so no obvious direct recursion. The only points that could cause indirect recursion are the calls into the external MHD_* API, which might invoke callbacks that in turn could call send_bad_request; those three calls are therefore reported for investigation. Other fragments (function header, local declarations, the strlen(BAD_REQUEST_PAGE) use, assignment to ret, and return ret;) do not themselves call user-level code that could lead to recursion and so do not require investigation for Rule 17.2."
