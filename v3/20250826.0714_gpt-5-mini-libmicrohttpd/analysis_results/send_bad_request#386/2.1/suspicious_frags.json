  "explanation": "The function is the only code fragment that could be suspect for Rule 2.1 because it has internal linkage (static). If this static function is never referenced elsewhere in the project, the entire function would be unreachable (dead) and should be investigated. No other parts of the provided code fragment contain unreachable statements: there are no conditional branches, labels, gotos, switch cases, or code after a return that would create unreachable statements within the function body. The sequence of calls and the final return are all reachable when the function is invoked, so they do not need further investigation for unreachable code. (Whether the function is actually unreachable in the whole project depends on the wider build\u2014this listing flags the function definition so that callers/usages can be checked.)"
