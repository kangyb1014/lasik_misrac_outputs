  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code only uses standard ISO C constructs: a file\u2011scope static function, an enum return type, normal prototype parameter typing, local pointer and enum variables, explicit casts (const void *), and ordinary function calls (strlen, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, unnamed struct/union extensions, or nonstandard inline/asm syntax) present in this snippet. Note: if any of the MHD_* identifiers are macros whose definitions (not shown here) use compiler-specific extensions, those macro definitions would need separate review; however, the code shown does not itself contain any documented compiler language extensions and thus does not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
