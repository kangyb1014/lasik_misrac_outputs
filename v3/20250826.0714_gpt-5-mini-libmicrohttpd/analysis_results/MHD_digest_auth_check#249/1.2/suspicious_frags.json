  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the shown code. The fragment uses only standard C constructs: a function definition, parameter list, and a call to another function with a macro constant. There are no vendor-specific keywords or known-extension tokens such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, labels-as-values (&&label), or GCC/Clang-specific extensions. The identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name; its expansion is not shown here, so the code as presented does not explicitly use a compiler extension. If the definition of _MHD_EXTERN (or of MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) expands to a compiler-specific extension, that expansion would need to be inspected, but that is outside the provided fragment."
