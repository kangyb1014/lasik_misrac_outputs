  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function consists solely of a single return statement that calls MHD_digest_auth_check2 with the forwarded parameters and a constant algorithm argument. There are no conditional branches, labels, gotos, dead statements after the return, or other constructs that could create unreachable code within this snippet. Preprocessor prefix (_MHD_EXTERN) and the macro MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 are declarations/constant identifiers only; they do not introduce unreachable code in this function body. Any concerns about unreachable code would have to come from code outside this snippet (e.g. the implementation of MHD_digest_auth_check2, macro expansions elsewhere, or different compilation configurations), which are not part of the provided code and therefore not subject to investigation here."
