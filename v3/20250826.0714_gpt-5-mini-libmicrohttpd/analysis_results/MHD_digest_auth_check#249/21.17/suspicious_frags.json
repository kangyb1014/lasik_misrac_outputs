  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this code fragment. The function is a simple wrapper that forwards its parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2 and returns its result. There are no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), no local character buffers, no pointer arithmetic, and no operations that could directly access memory beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by the pointer parameters. Any potential string-handling/bounds issues would reside in the implementation of MHD_digest_auth_check2 (not shown) \u2014 that callee should be inspected for uses of <string.h> functions that might access out-of-bounds memory."
