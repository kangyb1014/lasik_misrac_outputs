  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp (or other string comparison functions) appear in this function. The code is a simple wrapper that forwards its parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2; it performs no comparisons or operations on the null-terminated strings (realm, username, password) itself. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: the implementation of MHD_digest_auth_check2 should be inspected separately if checking for memcmp usage there.)"
