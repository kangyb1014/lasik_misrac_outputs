  "explanation": "There is no direct call from MHD_digest_auth_check to itself in the provided snippet, so no direct recursion. The only call inside this function is to MHD_digest_auth_check2; therefore the only possible Rule 17.2 concern in this fragment is indirect recursion if MHD_digest_auth_check2 (or any functions it calls) eventually call MHD_digest_auth_check. There are no other functions, function-pointer uses, macros, or additional code paths in the snippet that could introduce recursion, so no other fragments from this code need investigation."
