First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The provided code fragment contains no for statements at all, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops) cannot be violated within this snippet. The function is a simple wrapper that returns the result of calling MHD_digest_auth_check2 with the provided parameters and a constant algorithm identifier; there are no loop counters, loop clauses, or loop bodies present here. Any potential for-loop issues would have to be investigated in other code (for example, inside MHD_digest_auth_check2), but that code is not part of the supplied fragment and therefore should not be investigated based on this input."
