  "explanation": "No pointer declarations, pointer parameters, or pointer return usages appear in this function. The code only uses scalar identifiers and function calls with no visible pointer arguments in the snippet; the string literal passed to printf is not a pointer declaration in this code. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). If pointer-bearing definitions (e.g. of tool_params, or the prototypes of the called functions) exist elsewhere, they are outside the provided code and thus not part of this review."
