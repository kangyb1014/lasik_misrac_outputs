  "explanation": "Only function calls can create direct or indirect recursion relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The four fragments above are the only function calls present in the provided function and therefore are the only places that could introduce a call cycle back to check_apply_param__all_cpus. Other parts of the function (the parameter check: \"if (! tool_params.all_cpus) return;\", the variable access/assignment, the return statement, and the surrounding braces and signature) are not function calls and thus cannot participate in a call cycle; they do not need investigation for recursion under Rule 17.2."
