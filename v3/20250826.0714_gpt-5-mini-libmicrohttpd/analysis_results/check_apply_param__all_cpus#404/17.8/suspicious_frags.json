  "explanation": "The function check_apply_param__all_cpus has no parameters (signature: void). Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter shall not be modified) cannot be violated in this function. The identifiers referenced (tool_params.all_cpus, num_threads, get_process_cpu_core_count(), get_cpu_core_count(), printf(), print_all_cores_used()) are either globals, local variables, or calls to other functions\u2014not parameters of this function\u2014so there are no parameter modifications or pointer-parameter issues to investigate here."
