  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs: a file-scope static function definition, standard control flow (if, return), logical and equality operators, function calls (including standard library printf), and a string literal. There are no occurrences of compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, inline assembly, compiler-specific keywords/pragmas, builtins (e.g. __builtin_*), or other documented compiler extensions. The double underscore in the function name is an identifier naming choice (and may be in the implementation-reserved namespace), but it is not a compiler language extension as defined by compiler documentation, so it is not reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
