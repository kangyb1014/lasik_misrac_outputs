  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The function contains two if-statements: (1) if (! tool_params.all_cpus) return; \u2014 this tests a runtime-configurable struct member and is not a compile-time invariant; (2) if (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads) print_all_cores_used (); \u2014 this compares a runtime function result with num_threads, which was assigned from get_process_cpu_core_count() earlier in the function; both sides are determined at runtime and are not constant expressions. There are no loops with an invariant controlling expression (no infinite-loop or do-while constant-false patterns), and no other control statements in the snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
