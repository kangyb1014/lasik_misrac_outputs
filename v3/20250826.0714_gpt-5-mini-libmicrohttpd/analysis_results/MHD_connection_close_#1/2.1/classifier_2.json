  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the conditional call to daemon->notify_completed is executed when (daemon->notify_completed != NULL) and (connection->rq.client_aware) evaluate to true. This is a normal conditional execution and does not constitute unreachable code. (A violation would occur only if program logic guaranteed the condition was always false\u2014e.g. if notify_completed were statically guaranteed to be NULL and client_aware always false\u2014but nothing in the presented fragment makes the condition impossible.)"
