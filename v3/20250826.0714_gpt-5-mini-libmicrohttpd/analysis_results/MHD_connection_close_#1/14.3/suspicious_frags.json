  "explanation": "No control statements with invariant (compile-time constant) controlling expressions were found. Specific points:\n- The only macros that look like assertions (mhd_assert) are not C control statements in this code fragment; their conditions use object state (connection->suspended and a runtime check involving daemon/connection), not constant expressions.\n- The #ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS is a preprocessor conditional (not a run-time controlling expression governed by Rule 14.3).\n- The if conditions ( (NULL != daemon->notify_completed) && (connection->rq.client_aware) ), (NULL != resp), and (NULL != connection->pool) each depend on run-time values (pointer fields or structure members assigned at run time), not on invariant constant expressions.\n- There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with a constant controlling expression in this function.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
