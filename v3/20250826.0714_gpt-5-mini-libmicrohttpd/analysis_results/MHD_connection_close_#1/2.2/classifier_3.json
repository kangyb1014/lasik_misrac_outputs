  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_close_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_connection_close_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode termination_code)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n  struct MHD_Response *resp = connection->rp.response;\n\n  mhd_assert (! connection->suspended);\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment connection->pool = NULL is executed after MHD_pool_destroy(connection->pool) only when connection->pool was non-NULL. Removing that assignment would leave a dangling pointer in connection->pool and could change program behaviour (e.g. later code that checks connection->pool to avoid re-destroying or to detect that the pool has been cleaned up would behave differently, possibly causing double-free or use-after-free). Therefore the assignment is not dead code and Rule 2.2 is not violated."
