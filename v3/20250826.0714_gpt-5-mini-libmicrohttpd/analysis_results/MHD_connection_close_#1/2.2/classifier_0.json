  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_connection_close_:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_connection_close_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode termination_code)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n  struct MHD_Response *resp = connection->rp.response;\n\n  mhd_assert (! connection->suspended);\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment alone. As written this is an assertion macro (mhd_assert(!connection->suspended)); if the assertion can fail and its runtime effect (e.g. abort) is required for correct behaviour, it is not dead. If the macro is compiled out (no code generated) then it is not executed and therefore not dead. A concrete violation would occur if mhd_assert expands to an executed check that never fails (i.e. connection->suspended is provably always false at this point) and removal of the assertion would not change program behaviour \u2014 in that case the assertion is dead code."
