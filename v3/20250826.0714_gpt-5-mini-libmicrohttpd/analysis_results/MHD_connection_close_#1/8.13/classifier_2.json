  "scenario": "Cannot be determined from the fragment alone. The call passes &connection->rq.client_context (a pointer to a non-const object) to daemon->notify_completed. This is not a MISRA 8.13 violation by itself. A violation would occur only if the function-pointer type daemon->notify_completed is declared to take a non-const pointer but the callback does not (and need not) modify the pointed-to data \u2014 in that case the parameter should be const-qualified. If notify_completed is declared to accept a const-qualified pointer (or if it legitimately modifies the client_context), there is no violation."
