  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: resp is used to destroy/free the response (passed to MHD_destroy_response and the connection->rp.response member is set to NULL), so the pointer must refer to a modifiable object. Declaring it as non-const matches its intended use. If the code only read the response without modifying it, a const-qualified pointer would be preferred, but that is not the case here."
