  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. The only conditional constructs in this function are:\n- if (tool_params.single)\n- if (tool_params.unique)\n- the conditional operator: '-' == param_name[1] ? ... : ...\nEach of these depends on runtime values (fields of tool_params or the contents of param_name) and therefore is not an invariant constant expression. There are no loop constructs (while, for, do-while) with constant conditions. The assignment tool_params.shared = ! 0; is not a controlling expression (and although the use of '! 0' is unusual, it evaluates to the nonzero value 1 and is not a controlling-expression issue for Rule 14.3). Consequently, there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
