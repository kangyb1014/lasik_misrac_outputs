  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for Rule 8.13 were found. The only pointer in this function is the parameter declaration const char *param_name, which is already const-qualified and is only used for read-only operations (string formatting and indexing). There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed objects in this snippet that could be made to point to a const-qualified type. Uses of library objects such as stderr (FILE *) are not local pointer declarations in this function and thus not relevant to checking this rule here. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for missing const qualification of pointed-to types."
