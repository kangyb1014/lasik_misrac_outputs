  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be statically or obviously unreachable. The two if-blocks each contain runtime checks of non-constant flags (tool_params.single and tool_params.unique) followed by a fprintf and a return; these are reachable depending on runtime state. The assignment tool_params.shared = ! 0; and the final ternary return are reachable when both preceding conditions are false. There are no constant conditions, labels, unreachable statements after an unconditional return, infinite loops, or dead code constructs in this function. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
