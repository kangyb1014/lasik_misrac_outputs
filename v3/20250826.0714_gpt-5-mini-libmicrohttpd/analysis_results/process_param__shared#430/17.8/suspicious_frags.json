  "explanation": "I examined the function body for any operations that modify the parameter param_name (assignment, increment/decrement, pointer arithmetic that alters the pointer, or passing the parameter to a callee that could change the pointer itself). No such operations are present: param_name is only used for read-only purposes (passed to fprintf with \"%s\" and indexed as param_name[1] in a comparison). The only assignment in the function is to tool_params.shared, a global/struct field, not to the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no code fragments require further investigation under this rule."
