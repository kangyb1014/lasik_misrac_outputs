  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the fragment, so there are no direct uses that fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only place that operates on the string parameter is the direct indexing param_name[1]; this is not a <string.h> function call and therefore is outside the specific scope of Rule 21.17. Other constructs (fprintf, tool_params accesses, return statements) do not invoke string.h functions and thus do not need investigation for this rule."
