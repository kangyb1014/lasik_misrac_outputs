  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 17.2. The function process_param__shared does not call itself directly and contains no calls to other user-defined functions that could form an indirect recursion cycle. The only function called is the standard library fprintf, which does not invoke user callbacks here. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other call expressions in this fragment that could lead to indirect recursion. Global state accesses (tool_params, param_name) are data uses only and do not imply function calls."
