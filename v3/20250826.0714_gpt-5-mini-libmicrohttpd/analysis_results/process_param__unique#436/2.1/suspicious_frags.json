  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code was found in this function. Rationale:\n- The two early-return branches (if (tool_params.shared) and if (tool_params.single)) are conditional on runtime flags and therefore their bodies are reachable when those flags are set; they are not dead code.\n- The assignment tool_params.unique = ! 0; is executed when neither of the above conditions holds, so it is reachable.\n- The final return uses a conditional expression depending on param_name[1]; both outcomes are reachable at runtime (e.g. a long option starting with \"--\" makes param_name[1] == '-', while a short option like \"-x\" makes it != '-').\n- There are no constant false conditions, no code after an unconditional return, and no unreachable labels or statements in this fragment.\n\nNote (not related to MISRA Rule 2.1): the code indexes param_name[1] without checking for NULL or minimum length, which can lead to undefined behavior at runtime; this is a safety/robustness issue but not an instance of unreachable code. If desired, reviewers can inspect surrounding code to ensure param_name is always valid before calling this function."
