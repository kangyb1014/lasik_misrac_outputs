Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__unique:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__unique (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.shared)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-S' or '--shared'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.single)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-I' or '--single'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.unique = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.unique = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment itself is not inherently dead: it sets tool_params.unique to 1 (the expression '!0' yields 1) and will affect program behaviour if that field is subsequently read. Therefore, in the typical case this is not a Rule 2.2 violation. However, it would be a violation if the field is never read (or is always overwritten before any read). Example violation scenario: tool_params.unique is only ever written (including here) and never subsequently accessed anywhere in the project, or it is always assigned another value before any read \u2014 in that case removing this assignment would not change program behaviour, so it would be dead code and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
