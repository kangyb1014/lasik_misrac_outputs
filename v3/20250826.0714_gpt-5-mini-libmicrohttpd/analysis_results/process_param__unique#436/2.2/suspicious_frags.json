Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in this function (braces, indentation, string literal concatenation and the surrounding minimal syntax) are not candidates for dead code: they are either structural (function body delimiters) or form part of expressions whose removal would clearly change program behaviour (e.g. the fprintf calls produce observable output, the ternary return yields the function result). The listed fragments are flagged because they can represent likely dead-code situations in a project context: a static function that may be unused (function declaration), conditional branches that may never be taken (the two if-blocks), an assignment that might never be read (tool_params.unique = ! 0;), and a return expression whose operand indexing or constant outcome could make the operation redundant. These fragments should be investigated in the broader project to determine if they are indeed dead code (for example by checking whether the static function is ever called, whether the tool_params fields are ever set/used elsewhere, and whether the return value is relied upon)."
