  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains ordinary, reachable constructs (the while loop header and body, the key/match test block that advances bpos and uses continue, the computation of klen/vlen, the memset/memcpy operations and final function end). Those parts are exercised by the search loop and are not inherently unreachable: the loop can iterate, the key-match test can go either way, and when a match is found the code that follows is executed. The only control-flow points that can short-circuit execution of subsequent code are the explicit returns listed above; therefore they are the primary fragments that require investigation for potential unreachable-code issues (e.g. whether early returns incorrectly prevent further searching or make other code paths impossible). Other lines (pointer arithmetic, strlen, strstr, strchr usage, bpos update, memcpy, null-termination write) are reachable in normal execution paths and so do not need to be investigated for Rule 2.1-specific unreachable-code concerns."
