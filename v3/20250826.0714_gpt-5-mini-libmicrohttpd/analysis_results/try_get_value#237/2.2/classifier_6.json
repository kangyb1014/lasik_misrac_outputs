Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of try_get_value:\n```c\nstatic void\ntry_get_value (const char *buf,\n               const char *key,\n               char **destination)\n{\n  const char *spos;\n  const char *bpos;\n  const char *endv;\n  size_t klen;\n  size_t vlen;\n\n  if (NULL != *destination)\n    return;\n  bpos = buf;\n  klen = strlen (key);\n  while (NULL != (spos = strstr (bpos, key)))\n  {\n    if ( (spos[klen] != '=') ||\n         ( (spos != buf) &&\n           (spos[-1] != ' ') ) )\n    {\n      /* no match */\n      bpos = spos + 1;\n      continue;\n    }\n    if (spos[klen + 1] != '\"')\n      return;                   /* not quoted */\n    if (NULL == (endv = strchr (&spos[klen + 2],\n                                '\\\"')))\n      return;                   /* no end-quote */\n    vlen = (size_t) (endv - spos) - klen - 1;\n    *destination = malloc (vlen);\n    if (NULL == *destination)\n      return;                   /* out of memory */\n    (*destination)[vlen - 1] = '\\0';\n    memcpy (*destination,\n            &spos[klen + 2],\n            vlen - 1);\n    return;                     /* success */\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(*destination)[vlen - 1] = '\\0';\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment (*destination)[vlen - 1] = '\\0'; is required to null-terminate the allocated buffer. Removing it would change program behaviour (the copied bytes from memcpy would not include a terminator and the buffer would contain indeterminate data), so the operation is not dead code."
