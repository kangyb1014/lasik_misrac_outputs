  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not reported because they are plainly required for the function\u2019s observable behaviour and are not obviously removable without changing program semantics. In particular: the variable declarations (spos, bpos, endv, klen, vlen) are used; the initial klen = strlen(key) is required to locate the key; bpos = buf is needed to start the search; the while loop header that iterates with strstr is the core search mechanism; the final unconditional return from the function and the loop structure control flow are necessary. These not-reported lines perform observable operations (searching, pointer arithmetic, index checks) whose removal would alter behaviour, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The listed fragments should be investigated because they contain early returns, allocations and writes whose removal or alteration might not change behaviour in some call patterns (or might be redundant/incorrect), so they merit closer review for potential dead-code issues or logic errors."
