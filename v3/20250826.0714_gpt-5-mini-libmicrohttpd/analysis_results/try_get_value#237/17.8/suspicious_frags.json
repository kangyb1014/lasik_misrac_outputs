  "explanation": "Only operations that write through the pointer-parameter (destination) or potentially change the object it points to need investigation under Rule 17.8. The other code fragments do not modify function parameters themselves: buf and key are only read (not assigned), local pointers (bpos, spos, endv) are used and assigned but are local variables, and pointer arithmetic/indexing on buf/key does not reassign the parameter variables. Therefore only the function signature (showing the pointer-to-pointer parameter) and the statements that read or write *destination are relevant to verify compliance with the rule; no other lines modify the parameter variables themselves."
