As written this is a tautological, side-effect-free check: it will always evaluate to true in a correct configuration, so executing it does not alter program behaviour and its removal would not change the program. Therefore, when mhd_assert expands to code that is executed (e.g. in debug builds), this constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. (If mhd_assert is compiled out entirely in release builds, it is not executed there, but that does not remove the violation in builds where the assertion is active.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA R2.2 forbids code that is executed yet whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert lines are runtime checks of build-time/configuration consistency: if the equality ever fails they can change program behaviour (trap/abort/log), so they are not provably removable in the general project sense. Even when the expression evaluates to true in a particular correct configuration, (a) removing the assertion would remove a diagnostic that matters if the configuration is ever wrong, and (b) per MISRA Note 1, executed operations can affect timing/behaviour in embedded systems, so their removal can matter. Finally, a compiler may constant-fold and optimize away a purely-true assert so it might not even be executed; that would make it not dead code (it is simply optimized out). For these reasons the assertion checks are not dead code under Rule 2.2 and the agent A report is incorrect."
