  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void)0; is an explicit no\u2011op used as the final else branch of a chain that is assembled via preprocessor conditionals. It is a syntactic placeholder so the various combinations of #if/#elif/#else compile correctly; removing it may break compilation for some build configurations (or at least change program timing/behaviour) and therefore it is not an instance of dead code as defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour). In short, the statement is an intentional placeholder needed for correctness across configurations and so does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation."
