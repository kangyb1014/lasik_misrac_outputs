When both MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT and MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT are defined this becomes a runtime check of constant values (no side effects); removing that check would not change program behaviour, so it is dead code.

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario as presented. The mhd_assert in question compares two preprocessor constants (SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE and SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE). When both feature macros (MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT and MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT) are defined that comparison is a constant expression with no side effects. If the expression is always true for the given build, executing the runtime assertion has no effect on program behavior; therefore the operation is dead code according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (an executed operation whose removal would not affect behavior). The correct approach for checking relationships between compile-time constants is a compile-time assertion (e.g. _Static_assert / static_assert), which avoids introducing executed-but-redundant checks.\n\nCaveats: if mhd_assert has observable side effects beyond the check (for example logging) then removing it could change behavior; or if the compared values are not actually compile-time constants in the translation unit used, the check might not be constant. If either of those is true, then the claim would not apply. Absent those, Agent A\u2019s report is justified and the code violates Rule 2.2; replace the runtime assert with a compile-time assertion for a compliant solution."
