  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_default_logger_:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_default_logger_ (void *cls,\n                     const char *fm,\n                     va_list ap)\n{\n  vfprintf ((FILE *) cls, fm, ap);\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  fflush ((FILE *) cls);\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvfprintf ((FILE *) cls, fm, ap);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to vfprintf produces observable side effects by writing formatted output to the FILE stream pointed to by cls (and thus affects program behaviour \u2014 e.g. logging/console output). Removing that call would change the program's observable behaviour, so it is not dead code. (The subsequent conditional fflush does not make the vfprintf call dead.)"
