  "explanation": "Other parts of the code do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the format parameter is already const-qualified (const char *fm), va_list ap is not a pointer-to-object type relevant to this rule, and no other pointer declarations or conversions appear in the function. The three reported fragments are the only places where a non-const generic pointer is declared or cast to a FILE* and therefore are the only candidates requiring review for possible const-qualification."
