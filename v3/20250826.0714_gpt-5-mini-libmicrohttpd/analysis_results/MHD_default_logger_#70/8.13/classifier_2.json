  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The parameter cls is cast to FILE * and passed to vfprintf/fflush, both of which take a modifiable FILE * (they update stream state). Because the pointed-to object must be mutable, it is not possible to make the pointer point to a const-qualified type here. (As a nitpick, declaring the parameter as FILE * instead of void * would avoid the cast.)"
