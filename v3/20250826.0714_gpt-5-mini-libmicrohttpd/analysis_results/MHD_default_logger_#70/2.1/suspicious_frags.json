  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs are present in the provided function. The body contains a single call to vfprintf and, under conditional compilation, a call to fflush. There are no returns, breaks, gotos, infinite loops, or code following an unconditional exit that would make any statements unreachable. The #ifdef _DEBUG block is not 'unreachable' \u2014 it is conditionally compiled and either present or absent depending on the build configuration, which is acceptable; it does not represent code that can never be executed when compiled in that configuration. The function is static (possible unusedness) but unused functions are not the same as unreachable code within a function. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
