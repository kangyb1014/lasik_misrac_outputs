  "explanation": "Only calls that can produce direct or indirect recursion are the function calls inside MHD_default_logger_. The function declaration, parameter list, casts to (FILE *), the #ifdef/_DEBUG guard and the function prologue/epilogue do not by themselves introduce recursion and therefore need no investigation for Rule 17.2. In particular, there are no explicit self-calls in this function; only the two library calls listed above could (in unusual platform-specific or hook-installed implementations) lead to indirect recursion and should be inspected."
