Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_nonce_timestamp:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_nonce_timestamp (const char *const nonce,\n                     size_t noncelen,\n                     uint64_t *const ptimestamp)\n{\n  if (0 == noncelen)\n    noncelen = strlen (nonce);\n\n  if (true\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT) || defined(MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT)\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n      )\n    return false;\n\n  if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN !=\n      MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             ptimestamp))\n    return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN !=\n      MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             ptimestamp))\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ affects program behaviour (it converts the timestamp substring and writes to *ptimestamp and its return value controls flow). Removing this operation would change the outcome (ptimestamp wouldn\u2019t be set and the function\u2019s return value could differ), so it is not dead code."
