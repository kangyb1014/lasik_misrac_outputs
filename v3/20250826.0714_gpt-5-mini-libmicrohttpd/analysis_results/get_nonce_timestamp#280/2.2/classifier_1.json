The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_nonce_timestamp:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_nonce_timestamp (const char *const nonce,\n                     size_t noncelen,\n                     uint64_t *const ptimestamp)\n{\n  if (0 == noncelen)\n    noncelen = strlen (nonce);\n\n  if (true\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT) || defined(MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT)\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n      )\n    return false;\n\n  if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN !=\n      MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             ptimestamp))\n    return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  return true;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The final 'return true;' is reachable in normal builds and cannot be removed without changing behavior (removal would lead to falling off a non-void function and undefined behaviour). In a specific build configuration with neither MHD_MD5_SUPPORT nor SHA256/SHA512_256 support, the preceding conditional reduces to 'if (true) return false;', making the 'return true;' unreachable. Per MISRA Rule 2.2 note 2, unreachable code is not considered dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
