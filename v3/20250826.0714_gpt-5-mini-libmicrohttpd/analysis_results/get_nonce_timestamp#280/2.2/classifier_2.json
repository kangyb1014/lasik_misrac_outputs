Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_nonce_timestamp:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_nonce_timestamp (const char *const nonce,\n                     size_t noncelen,\n                     uint64_t *const ptimestamp)\n{\n  if (0 == noncelen)\n    noncelen = strlen (nonce);\n\n  if (true\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT) || defined(MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT)\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n      )\n    return false;\n\n  if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN !=\n      MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             ptimestamp))\n    return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  if (true\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT) || defined(MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT)\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n      )\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The conditional is controlled by preprocessor macros so at compile time it becomes either a runtime test of noncelen against one or two expected lengths or an unconditional return (if no support macros are defined). None of these cases produces an operation that is executed yet removable without affecting program behaviour. Even if the condition reduces to \"if (true) return false;\" that is an unconditional return (not dead code) and any code made unreachable by it is \"unreachable code\", which the rule notes explicitly distinguishes from dead code."
