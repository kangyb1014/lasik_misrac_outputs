  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code uses strlen to obtain the length when noncelen is zero, integer comparisons of noncelen against constant lengths, and a call to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ to parse the timestamp substring. None of these are memcmp calls or string comparisons using memcmp on null-terminated strings. Conditional macros (e.g. NONCE_STD_LEN, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) are only used in numeric length checks and do not introduce memcmp usage in this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
