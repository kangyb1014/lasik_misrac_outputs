The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_upgrade_action:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_upgrade_action (struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh,\n                    enum MHD_UpgradeAction action,\n                    ...)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *connection;\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  connection = urh->connection;\n\n  /* Precaution checks on external data. */\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  daemon = connection->daemon;\n  if (NULL == daemon)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  switch (action)\n  {\n  case MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE:\n    if (urh->was_closed)\n      return MHD_NO; /* Already closed. */\n\n    /* transition to special 'closed' state for start of cleanup */\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n    if (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS) )\n    {\n      /* signal that app is done by shutdown() of 'app' socket */\n      /* Application will not use anyway this socket after this command. */\n      shutdown (urh->app.socket,\n                SHUT_RDWR);\n    }\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n    mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE == connection->state);\n    /* The next function will mark the connection as closed by application\n     * by setting 'urh->was_closed'.\n     * As soon as connection will be marked with BOTH\n     * 'urh->was_closed' AND 'urh->clean_ready', it will\n     * be moved to cleanup list by MHD_resume_connection(). */\n    MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (connection);\n    return MHD_YES;\n  case MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CORK_ON:\n    /* Unportable API.

  "scenario": "This line is an assertion macro. In typical implementations it either (a) expands to a runtime check that aborts/logs on failure (so its removal would change failure-handling behaviour) or (b) is compiled out (expands to no-op) in release builds (so nothing is executed). In both typical cases the statement does not constitute \"dead code\" as defined by MISRA 2.2. However, it would violate Rule 2.2 if mhd_assert were implemented as a runtime operation that is executed in production but has no effect on program state or control flow (for example, it just evaluates the expression and discards the result or only logs information without affecting behaviour). In that implementation the assertion would be an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, and thus would be dead code and a Rule 2.2 violation."
