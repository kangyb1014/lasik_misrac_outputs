  "explanation": "I selected all controlling statements (if and switch) in the function so they can be inspected for invariant controlling expressions. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: mhd_assert is not a control statement; the ternary operator in the return lines is not a selection/iteration controlling expression covered by this rule; shutdown, return, and function calls are not controlling expressions; there are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) here that could be invariant or rely on the provided exceptions. Therefore no other fragments are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
