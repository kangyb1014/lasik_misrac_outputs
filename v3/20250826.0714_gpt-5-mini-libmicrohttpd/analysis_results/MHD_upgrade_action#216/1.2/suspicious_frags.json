  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that may hide compiler-specific language extensions: the leading _MHD_EXTERN on the function declaration is commonly a macro that expands to compiler-specific linkage/attribute annotations (for example __attribute__ or __declspec), the function uses a variadic parameter list ('...') which is standard C but should be checked for any compiler\u2011specific handling in macros, and the HTTPS_SUPPORT block calls shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) which depends on OS-level APIs (not a language extension itself but platform-specific). The cork-related calls use true/false and return a ternary expression; these are normal C constructs but the underlying implementation of MHD_connection_set_cork_state_ or the macros it uses may employ compiler extensions \u2014 those call sites are included so investigators can inspect the definitions of _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_, and any macros they expand to. Other code in the snippet (enum, switch/case, pointer checks, returns, mhd_assert, #ifdef/#endif, comments) uses standard C syntax and does not show any explicit compiler-specific extension syntax such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, or compiler builtins; therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
