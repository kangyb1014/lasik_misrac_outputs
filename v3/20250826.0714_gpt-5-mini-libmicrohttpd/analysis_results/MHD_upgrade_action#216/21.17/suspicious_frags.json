  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code fragment. The function uses control flow, pointer checks (NULL checks on urh, connection, daemon), shutdown(), mhd_assert(), and calls to internal functions (MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_) \u2014 none of which are standard string-handling routines covered by Rule 21.17. The variadic parameter '...' is declared but not used in this fragment and does not by itself imply use of string.h functions or out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
