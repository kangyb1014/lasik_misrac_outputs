  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the only places in this function that invoke string handling/library string-copy functions or perform substring/character searches that could potentially read from pointer parameters beyond their object bounds (they pass pointers into standard string functions). Other code in the function does not use functions from <string.h> in a way that can read past object bounds, or performs explicit bounds checks that prevent out-of-bounds access and so need not be investigated for Rule 21.17: \n\n- The second snprintf call that computes res is followed by an explicit check (if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof (fn) <= (size_t) res))) that ensures res is within the buffer size before the buffer is indexed; code that uses res afterwards is therefore bounds-checked.\n- The initial snprintf used to create intermediate directory names writes into fn with an explicit size parameter; even if it truncates, snprintf guarantees a terminating NUL when size>0, so no string.h routine will read beyond the buffer because no unbounded reads are performed on that truncated result.\n- The write/close/open/unlink/strerror calls operate on raw buffers or file descriptors and do not invoke <string.h> routines that read until a NUL; they use explicit sizes or system semantics rather than implicit string termination.\n- The isprint usage casts to unsigned char and, where it indexes fn, the index is derived from res which is validated (see above), so that indexing is bounds-controlled.\n- do_append and other helper calls that accept (data, size) operate on explicit size parameters rather than relying on NUL-terminated strings; they do not invoke the <string.h> functions named by Rule 21.17 in this snippet.\n\nTherefore, aside from the fragments listed above, there are no other locations in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
