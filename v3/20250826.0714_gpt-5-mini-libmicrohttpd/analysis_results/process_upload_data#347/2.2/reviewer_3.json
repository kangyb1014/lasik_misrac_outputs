  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) content_type;' is an executed no-op whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The cast-to-void expression has no side effects and serves only to suppress a compiler warning; therefore it is an operation that is executed but has no effect on program semantics. Note 2 (unreachable code) does not apply here. To comply with MISRA, the code should be changed to avoid the unused parameter (for example by redesigning the interface to omit the parameter, use a compiler-supported unused-parameter attribute in a way acceptable to the project, or document and formally deviate from the rule), rather than leaving a no-op expression statement in the body."
