  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment alone. The call MHD_pool_deallocate(c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size) is a single call from connection_shrink_read_buffer to a pool-deallocation function and does not itself demonstrate recursion. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if MHD_pool_deallocate (or something it invokes) calls connection_shrink_read_buffer (directly or via a chain of calls). For example, a violating scenario would be: MHD_pool_deallocate triggers a pool-object destructor or cleanup callback that calls back into connection_shrink_read_buffer (or into another function that eventually calls connection_shrink_read_buffer), creating indirect recursion. Since the implementation of MHD_pool_deallocate is not shown, there is no evidence of such a callback in the provided code fragment, so the rule is not shown to be violated."
