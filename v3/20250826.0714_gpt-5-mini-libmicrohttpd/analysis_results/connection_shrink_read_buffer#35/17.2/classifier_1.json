  "scenario": "The fragment calls MHD_pool_reallocate from within connection_shrink_read_buffer. There is no direct call from connection_shrink_read_buffer to itself. Based on the shown code, no indirect recursion is evident either. (Only if MHD_pool_reallocate or a function it calls were to call connection_shrink_read_buffer would an indirect recursion occur, but there is no evidence of that in this fragment.)"
