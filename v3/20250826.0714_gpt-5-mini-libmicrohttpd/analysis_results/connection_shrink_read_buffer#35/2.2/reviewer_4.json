(If mhd_assert can abort or has side effects in that build, then it would not be dead code.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct in the scenario described. If mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in the build (the usual release form similar to assert when NDEBUG is set), the statement mhd_assert(0 == c->read_buffer_offset); executes but has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour \u2014 and so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. This conclusion depends on the definition of mhd_assert: if in some builds mhd_assert evaluates the expression or has side effects (e.g. aborts on failure, logs, or influences timing), then the statement would not be dead code.
