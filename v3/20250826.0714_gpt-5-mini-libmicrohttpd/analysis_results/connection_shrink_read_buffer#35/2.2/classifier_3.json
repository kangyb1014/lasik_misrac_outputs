Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_shrink_read_buffer:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_shrink_read_buffer (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  void *new_buf;\n\n  if ((NULL == c->read_buffer) || (0 == c->read_buffer_size))\n  {\n    mhd_assert (0 == c->read_buffer_size);\n    mhd_assert (0 == c->read_buffer_offset);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  mhd_assert (c->read_buffer_offset <= c->read_buffer_size);\n  if (0 == c->read_buffer_offset)\n  {\n    MHD_pool_deallocate (c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size);\n    c->read_buffer = NULL;\n    c->read_buffer_size = 0;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    mhd_assert (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (c->pool, c->read_buffer, \\\n                                               c->read_buffer_size));\n    new_buf = MHD_pool_reallocate (c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size,\n                                   c->read_buffer_offset);\n    mhd_assert (c->read_buffer == new_buf);\n    c->read_buffer = new_buf;\n    c->read_buffer_size = c->read_buffer_offset;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (c->read_buffer_offset <= c->read_buffer_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement mhd_assert(c->read_buffer_offset <= c->read_buffer_size); does not constitute dead code. If the mhd_assert macro expands to a runtime check (e.g. calls an assert-failure handler), its presence can affect program behaviour (it may abort/log) so removing it would change behaviour in failing cases. If mhd_assert is a no-op in production builds (expands to ((void)0)), then the assertion is not executed at all and therefore is not \u2018dead code\u2019 as defined by Rule 2.2 (dead code must be executed but removable without effect). Thus Rule 2.2 is not violated."
