  "explanation": "The fragments selected cover all conditional decision points and their bodies: the initial guard that returns early, the subsequent assertion on buffer offsets, and the two mutually exclusive branches (deallocate vs reallocate). These are the locations where control flow can make code unreachable and thus merit investigation for Rule 2.1. Other parts of the function (the alias declaration 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;', the local 'void *new_buf;' declaration, and simple assignments that occur inside the already-selected branches) are straightforward statements that do not introduce additional conditional control flow that could hide unreachable code, so they do not need separate investigation for reachability."
