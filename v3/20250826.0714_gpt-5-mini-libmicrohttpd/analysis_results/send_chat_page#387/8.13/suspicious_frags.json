  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *con' is passed to library APIs that typically expect a mutable connection pointer and so cannot be made const here; the local 'struct MHD_Response *res' is created, queued and destroyed (it is mutated/managed by the API), so making it a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate; the enum 'ret' and the return statement are not pointer usages. The strlen(CHAT_PAGE) usage is fine because strlen accepts a const char *; the only potential const-qualification issue is the explicit cast to const void * for CHAT_PAGE (which may hide that CHAT_PAGE is not actually const-qualified). Therefore only the fragments that involve CHAT_PAGE/casting need further inspection."
