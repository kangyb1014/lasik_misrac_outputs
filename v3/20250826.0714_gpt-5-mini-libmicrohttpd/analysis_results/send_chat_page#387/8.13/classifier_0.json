  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The expression casts CHAT_PAGE to (const void *), so the pointer type is const-qualified and Rule 8.13 is satisfied. Note: if CHAT_PAGE itself is declared without const, the preferred fix is to declare CHAT_PAGE as const (e.g. const char[]) rather than relying on a cast, but the fragment shown does not violate Rule 8.13."
