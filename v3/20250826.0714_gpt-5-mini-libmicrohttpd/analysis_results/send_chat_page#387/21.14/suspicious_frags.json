  "explanation": "I scanned the provided function for any use of the standard memcmp function or any indirect use (macros or inline wrappers) that would compare null-terminated strings. The code only calls strlen(CHAT_PAGE) and libmicrohttpd functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). There is no memcmp call, no string comparison using memcmp, and no other construct that implies memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
