  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code. If you do not find any suspicious code fragments, return an empty list for suspicious_frags\n- explanation: The explanation of why other code fragments should NOT be investigated.\nIt is very important to not miss any suspicious code fragments, so please give a sufficient explanation why other code fragments should not be investigated.\nDO NOT give any explanation for the selected suspicious code fragments.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_chat_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nsend_chat_page (struct MHD_Connection *con)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *res;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  res = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (CHAT_PAGE),\n                                                (const void *) CHAT_PAGE);\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (con, MHD_HTTP_OK, res);\n  MHD_destroy_response (res);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease find suspicious code fragments in the code and report them. Other agents can not investigate other fragments that you do not report, so it is very important to find all suspicious fragments without missing any.

  "explanation": "The remaining parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the function signature and local variable declarations are standard and both variables are used; there is no unreachable code or obvious no-op statements outside the selected fragments; the curly-brace structure and whitespace have no effect on behavior. The selected fragments contain the executed operations that could be redundant (resource lifetime, return handling and the explicit cast/length call) and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
