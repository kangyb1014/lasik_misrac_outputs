  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: this call is to the standard strlen function with CHAT_PAGE (presumably a string constant), so send_chat_page does not call itself. A specific violation scenario would be if CHAT_PAGE expanded to an expression that invoked send_chat_page (for example, #define CHAT_PAGE (send_chat_page(...))) or if strlen were replaced by a macro that called send_chat_page \u2014 either would create indirect recursion and thus violate Rule 17.2."
