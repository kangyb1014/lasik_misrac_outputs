  "explanation": "All other code fragments in the function are simple declarations, assignments, a return statement, or use of a constant/string (e.g. CHAT_PAGE) and do not contain function calls that could produce direct or indirect recursion. The function signature and local variable declarations do not invoke any functions. Therefore they do not need investigation with respect to Rule 17.2 (no self or indirect calls)."
