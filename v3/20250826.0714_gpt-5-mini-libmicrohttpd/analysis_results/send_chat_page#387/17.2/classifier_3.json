  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and does not call send_chat_page (there is no direct or indirect recursion shown). A Rule 17.2 violation would occur only if one of the called functions (e.g. MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static or MHD_queue_response) were to call back to send_chat_page (directly or through a chain of calls), which is not evidenced here."
