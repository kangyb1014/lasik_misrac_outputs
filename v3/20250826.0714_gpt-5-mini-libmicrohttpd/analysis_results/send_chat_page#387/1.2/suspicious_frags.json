  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The items present are all standard C constructs: a static function definition returning an enum type, a normal prototype parameter (struct MHD_Connection *con), local declarations, explicit cast to (const void *) (which is standard), and ordinary function calls. There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, __asm, inline assembly, #pragma GCC, variable-length array extensions, designated initializer extensions, or other vendor-specific constructs). The MHD_* identifiers are library API names, not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
