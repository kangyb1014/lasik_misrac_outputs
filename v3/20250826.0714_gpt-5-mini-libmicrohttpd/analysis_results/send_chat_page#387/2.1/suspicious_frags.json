  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found. The function contains a single straight-line sequence: creation of the response object, queuing the response, destroying the response, and returning the result. There are no conditional branches, early returns, loops, goto statements, or compiler-intrinsic attributes in the snippet that would make any statement unreachable. Calls to external functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) do not, in this snippet, introduce unreachable code; even if they fail at run time, their failure would not render subsequent source lines syntactically or statically unreachable. Therefore there are no code locations here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
