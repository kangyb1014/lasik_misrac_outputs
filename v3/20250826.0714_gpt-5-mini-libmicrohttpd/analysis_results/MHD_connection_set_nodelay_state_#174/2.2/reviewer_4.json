  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements \u201c(void) connection; (void) nodelay_state;\u201d in the #else branch are executed no-op expression statements that have no side effects; removing them would not change program behaviour. Per the quoted text of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), these statements qualify as dead code and therefore breach Rule 2.2. (If suppression of unused\u2011parameter warnings is required, the correct remedial action under MISRA would be to apply an accepted annotation/justification mechanism or alter the function signature/usage rather than leaving no\u2011op statements that constitute dead code.)"
