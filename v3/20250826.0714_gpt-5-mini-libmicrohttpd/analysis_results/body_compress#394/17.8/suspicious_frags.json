  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a pointer parameter itself (e.g. assigning to the parameter variable buf or buf_size). In this function there are no assignments to the parameter variables buf or buf_size. The code does dereference the parameters and modifies the objects they point to (e.g. free(*buf); *buf = (void *)cbuf; *buf_size = (size_t)cbuf_size; and uses *buf and *buf_size in calls), but the rule explicitly permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter. There are no casts or operations that assign to buf or buf_size themselves, so no code fragments violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation for this rule."
