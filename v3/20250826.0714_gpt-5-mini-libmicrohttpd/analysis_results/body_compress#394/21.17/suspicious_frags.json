  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> are used in this code fragment. The code calls compressBound, malloc, compress and free \u2014 none are standard <string.h> string-handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen or strspn that fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no direct uses of the specified string functions that could produce out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17 and nothing in this snippet needs investigation for that specific rule. (Note: integer type conversions between size_t and uLong/uLongf or the behavior of the external library function compress are not in scope for Rule 21.17; they would be relevant to other MISRA rules if intended to be checked.)"
