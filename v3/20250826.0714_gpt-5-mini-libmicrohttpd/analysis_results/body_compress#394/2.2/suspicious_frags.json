  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. Every executed operation in this function affects program behaviour and therefore is not dead code: \n- The call to compressBound() sets cbuf_size used to allocate cbuf; removing it would change allocation and behaviour.\n- The malloc(cbuf_size) call and its NULL check determine allocation success and control flow (returning MHD_NO on failure). Removing them would change behaviour.\n- The call to compress(...) both produces the return code (ret) and updates cbuf_size; both values are used subsequently to decide whether to accept compressed data. The ret variable and cbuf_size check are therefore relevant to control flow.\n- The conditional branch that frees cbuf and returns MHD_NO on failure affects resource management and output behaviour.\n- The free(*buf) call and the assignments *buf = (void *) cbuf and *buf_size = (size_t) cbuf_size update caller-visible state and are essential.\n- The return values (MHD_NO / MHD_YES) determine caller behaviour.\n\nNon-executable tokens (comments, type casts) are not relevant to dead-code analysis. There is no unreachable code in this function; all branches that execute perform meaningful actions. Therefore no code fragment in this function appears to constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
