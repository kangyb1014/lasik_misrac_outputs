  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function parameter is void **buf and *buf has type void * (non-const). The code frees the object pointed to and later assigns a new (non-const) pointer into *buf, so the pointer must not be const-qualified. Therefore calling free(*buf) does not violate Rule 8.13. (A violation would occur if *buf were declared as pointing to a const-qualified type, e.g. const void * and free were applied or the code attempted to modify it.)"
