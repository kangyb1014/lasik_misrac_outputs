  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given code. The call free(*buf) calls the standard library free function, which does not call body_compress, so body_compress does not call itself directly or indirectly. A violation would occur only in a contrived situation where free had been redefined or wrapped so that calling free eventually invoked body_compress (for example, if free were implemented as a macro or wrapper function that calls body_compress), which would produce indirect recursion."
