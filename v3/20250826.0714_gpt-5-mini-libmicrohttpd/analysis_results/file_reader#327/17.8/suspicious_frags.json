  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code fragment. Analysis by parameter:\n- cls: Only cast to (FILE *) and assigned to a local variable (file). The parameter cls itself is not assigned to or modified.\n- pos: Used in a cast to (long) for the fseek call but not written to or otherwise modified; a cast does not constitute modifying the parameter.\n- buf: Passed to fread, which modifies the object pointed to by buf (the buffer contents). MISRA Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer itself. The pointer variable buf is not reassigned.\n- max: Used as an argument to fread and not modified.\nOther operations (fseek, fread, ferror) operate on the FILE object or return values; they do not modify any of the function parameters themselves. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that warrant investigation for Rule 17.8."
