  "explanation": "The entire static function definition is flagged because the 'static' linkage makes the function internal to the translation unit; if it is not referenced anywhere in the translation unit it is dead code and must be investigated. The local declaration/assignment \"FILE *file = (FILE *) cls;\" is flagged because the explicit cast may be redundant or indicate a mismatch of pointer types; while the assignment itself is used, the cast is syntactically unnecessary in C and worth checking (it does not change runtime behaviour but may hide type issues). The fseek call and its immediate error-return are flagged because platform-dependent behaviour (the comment notes fseek limitations) or a systematic failure of fseek (e.g. pos always out-of-range) could make subsequent code effectively non-impacting; this branching should be reviewed to ensure it is not masking dead code.\n\nWhy other fragments do NOT need investigation for Rule 2.2:\n- The fread call and the bytes_read variable are used to determine the actual number of bytes returned; they have observable effects and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- The conditional handling of bytes_read == 0 and the subsequent returns distinguish between end-of-stream and error; these branches affect program behaviour and are not dead.\n- The final return of (ssize_t) bytes_read is a necessary result conversion and used by callers; removing it would change behaviour.\n- Comments are non-executable and not subject to Rule 2.2.\n\nInvestigators should focus on whether the static function is actually referenced in the translation unit, whether the cast hides type-safety problems, and whether platform-dependent fseek behaviour causes parts of the function to be inert in practice."
