  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can affect reachability of subsequent code and therefore should be investigated for possible unreachable-code violations: the explicit write uri[uri_len] = 0; (possible out-of-bounds/overwriting can cause undefined behavior that may make later code effectively unreachable), the memchr() + null-termination block (modifies the buffer and influences later pointer arithmetic), the unescape_callback() call (it mutates uri and returns a new length \u2014 if it produces inconsistent lengths or corrupts memory it can render later branches unreachable), the comparison/memcmp block that returns false, the args computation (depends on earlier modifications and may point past/into invalid memory), and the check_argument_match() block (another early-return path). These are the spots most likely to produce unreachable code either directly (through unconditional returns) or indirectly via undefined behaviour that prevents later code from executing. Other fragments were not included because they are simple declarations or straightforward control-flow endpoints that do not themselves create unreachable code: e.g. the local variable declarations (struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;), the function prologue/epilogue, and the final return true; they are syntactically reachable and do not by themselves introduce unreachable code. Additionally, the debug logging lines are conditionally compiled (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) and are not unreachable in the sense of control flow within a given compilation \u2014 they are either present or absent depending on build configuration, which should be handled by review of the build configuration rather than flagged here as unreachable code."
