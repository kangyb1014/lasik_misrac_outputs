  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_uri_match:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncheck_uri_match (struct MHD_Connection *connection, char *uri, size_t uri_len)\n{\n  char *qmark;\n  char *args;\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n\n  uri[uri_len] = 0;\n  qmark = memchr (uri,\n                  '?',\n                  uri_len);\n  if (NULL != qmark)\n    *qmark = '\\0';\n\n  /* Need to unescape URI before comparing with connection->url */\n  uri_len = daemon->unescape_callback (daemon->unescape_callback_cls,\n                                       connection,\n                                       uri);\n  if ((uri_len != connection->rq.url_len) ||\n      (0 != memcmp (uri, connection->rq.url, uri_len)))\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (daemon,\n              _ (\"Authentication failed, URI does not match.\\n\"));\n#endif\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  args = (NULL != qmark) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The conditional selects the start of the argument string: if a '?' was found it yields qmark+1 (start of query), otherwise it yields uri + uri_len (empty string at end). The assigned args is subsequently used by check_argument_match, so removing the assignment or either branch would change program behaviour. Thus this executed code is not dead code under Rule 2.2."
