  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (NULL != qmark): qmark is set by memchr(uri, '?', uri_len) and thus depends on the runtime contents of uri and uri_len; it is not a constant.\n- if ((uri_len != connection->rq.url_len) || (0 != memcmp (uri, connection->rq.url, uri_len))): uri_len is returned by daemon->unescape_callback and memcmp compares runtime buffers; the expression depends on runtime values and is not invariant.\n- if (! check_argument_match (connection, args) ): the result depends on the callee and runtime arguments; it is not invariant.\n- The ternary used for args assignment is not a selection/iteration controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3, and it depends on qmark, which is not constant.\n- There are no iteration statements (for/while/do-while) in this function.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) in the provided code."
