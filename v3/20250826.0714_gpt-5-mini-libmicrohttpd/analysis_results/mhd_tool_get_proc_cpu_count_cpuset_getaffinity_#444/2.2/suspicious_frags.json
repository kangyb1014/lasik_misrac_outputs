  "explanation": "I flagged both 'if (0 >= ret)' blocks for investigation. The first such check immediately follows 'ret = -1' and therefore the condition is always true at that point; that conditional evaluation (and its presence/structure) should be reviewed for potential dead/redundant operations. The second 'if (0 >= ret)' (inside the HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S section) should also be reviewed because its necessity depends on whether the earlier code can actually set 'ret' to a non-negative value in the compiled configuration and at runtime.\n\nOther fragments were not marked because they are either:\n- Controlled by preprocessor configuration (e.g. #ifdef HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, #ifdef HAVE_CPU_COUNT, #ifdef HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS). Those alternate branches are included or excluded at compile time and must be evaluated in the context of the actual build configuration; they are not intrinsically executed dead code in the provided source as-is.\n- Dependent on runtime outcomes (e.g. the checks of cpuset_getaffinity return value, CPU_ALLOC NULL check). These operations guard behavior based on runtime results and cannot be classified as dead without execution-context evidence.\n- Semantically meaningful (e.g. converting a counted zero to -1, returning -1 on failure). Such assignments and returns affect the observable behavior and therefore are not candidates for dead-code removal.\n\nGiven MISRA Rule 2.2, the immediate conditional(s) around ret initialization and the subsequent conditional that depends on ret are the primary spots that warrant further inspection; other statements/branches either have clear runtime effect or are compile-time controlled and thus were not reported."
