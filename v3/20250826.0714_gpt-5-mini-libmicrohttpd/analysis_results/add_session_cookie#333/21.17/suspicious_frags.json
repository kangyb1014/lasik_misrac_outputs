  "explanation": "The code contains no direct calls to the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strcat, strlen, etc.). The only string construction present is the snprintf() writing into the fixed buffer cstr, using COOKIE_NAME and session->sid as %s sources; those are the only places where a bounds/read/termination issue could arise and therefore must be investigated. Other lines (the MHD_add_response_header call, the MHD_NO comparison, the fprintf call and the function structure) do not perform raw string/memory manipulation themselves and thus are not relevant to Rule 21.17 beyond their use of the cstr produced by snprintf (which is already flagged)."
