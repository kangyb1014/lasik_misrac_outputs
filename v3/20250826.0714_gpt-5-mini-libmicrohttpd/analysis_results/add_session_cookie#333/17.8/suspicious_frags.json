  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are:\n- struct Session *session \u2014 only used to read session->sid (no assignment to session), so the pointer itself is not modified. Accessing the object pointed to is permitted.  \n- struct MHD_Response *response \u2014 passed to MHD_add_response_header; the pointer is not reassigned or modified within this function. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter (via a call) is allowed by the rule.  \nOther operations (snprintf writing to local cstr, building a header string, and calling MHD_add_response_header) do not modify the parameter variables themselves, so no code fragments here violate Rule 17.8."
