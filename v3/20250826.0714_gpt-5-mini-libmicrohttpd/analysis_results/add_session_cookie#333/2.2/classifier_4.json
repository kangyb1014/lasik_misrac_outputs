  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_session_cookie:\n```c\nstatic void\nadd_session_cookie (struct Session *session,\n                    struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  char cstr[256];\n  snprintf (cstr,\n            sizeof (cstr),\n            \"%s=%s\",\n            COOKIE_NAME,\n            session->sid);\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,\n                               cstr))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set session cookie header!\\n\");\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\nadd_session_cookie (struct Session *session,\n                    struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The provided fragment is the definition of a static function. By itself this cannot be determined to be dead code. If, in the project, add_session_cookie (a static function, i.e. internal linkage) is never called or referenced, then its body would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. However, given only the fragment shown, there is no evidence that it is unused, so a violation cannot be confirmed."
