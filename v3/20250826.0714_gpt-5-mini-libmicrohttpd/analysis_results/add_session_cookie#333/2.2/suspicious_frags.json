  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that could plausibly be dead (or warrant investigation for being removable without changing program behaviour): the function declaration (because as a static function it might be unused at link time), the buffer declaration, the snprintf that constructs the cookie string, the call that sets the response header and its conditional, and the error-reporting fprintf. Other parts of the routine (the format string \"%s=%s\", the use of COOKIE_NAME and session->sid as arguments, the MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE token and the closing braces) are integral to the construction and setting of the cookie header; removing them would change behaviour, so they are not flagged. There is no obvious unreachable code in this fragment (note that unreachable code is distinct from dead code per the rule), and no other statements present that are executed yet appear to have no effect. Full determination of whether the static function is unused requires whole-project analysis (link-time/translation-unit information); that is why the function declaration itself is included for investigation."
