  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_session_cookie:\n```c\nstatic void\nadd_session_cookie (struct Session *session,\n                    struct MHD_Response *response)\n{\n  char cstr[256];\n  snprintf (cstr,\n            sizeof (cstr),\n            \"%s=%s\",\n            COOKIE_NAME,\n            session->sid);\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE,\n                               cstr))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set session cookie header!\\n\");\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set session cookie header!\\n\");\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fprintf call is executed only on error and produces an observable side-effect (writing to stderr and affecting timing). Therefore its removal could change program behaviour (diagnostics/timing), so it is not dead code in the general case. If, however, it can be proven for this project that stderr is entirely inert (never observed) and the I/O/timing side-effects are irrelevant, then it would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
