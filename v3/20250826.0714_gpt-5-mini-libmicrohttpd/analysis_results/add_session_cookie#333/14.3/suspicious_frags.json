  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The only control statement is the if that compares MHD_NO to the return value of MHD_add_response_header \u2014 that return value depends on a function call and is not a compile-time or constant invariant, so it does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other conditional expressions that are constant/invariant. Other statements (snprintf call, buffer declaration, fprintf) are not controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3."
