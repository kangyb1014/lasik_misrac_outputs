  "explanation": "No recursion observed in the provided code fragment. add_session_cookie does not call itself, nor does it call any other user-defined function from the same translation unit that could call it back. The only calls inside the function are to well-known library or external API functions: snprintf (C library), MHD_add_response_header (external libmicrohttpd API), and fprintf (C library). There are no function pointers passed, no callbacks invoked, and no references to add_session_cookie elsewhere in this fragment that could form an indirect call chain. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
