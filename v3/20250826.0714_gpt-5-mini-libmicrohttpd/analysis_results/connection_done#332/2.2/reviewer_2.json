Therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The same applies to the similar '(void) connection;' and '(void) toe;' lines.) Recommended fixes: remove the unused parameter name from the function prototype/definition or mark the parameter as intentionally unused via a standardized mechanism (e.g. a compiler attribute) instead of leaving no-op casts in executable code.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The three lines\n  (void) cls;\n  (void) connection;\n  (void) toe;\nare evaluated expression-statements that perform no observable action for the given parameter types; removing them would not change program behaviour, so they meet the definition of dead code and therefore violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The only caveat would be if evaluating the expression had observable side effects \u2014 e.g. the parameter had a volatile-qualified type or its evaluation invoked a function \u2014 which is not the case here.)\n\nRecommended fixes: omit the unused parameter names in the function definition if permitted by the callback signature, or mark parameters as intentionally unused via a standard mechanism (compiler attribute, macro, or a MISRA-approved annotation) instead of leaving no-op casts in executable code."
