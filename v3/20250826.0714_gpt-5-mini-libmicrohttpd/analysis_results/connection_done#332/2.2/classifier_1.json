Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_done:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_done (void *cls,\n                 struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                 void **req_cls,\n                 enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct Request *req = *req_cls;\n\n  (void) cls;\n  (void) connection;\n  (void) toe;\n  if (-1 != req->timerfd)\n    if (0 != close (req->timerfd))\n      abort ();\n  free (req);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\nconnection_done (void *cls,\n                 struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                 void **req_cls,\n                 enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is a static function definition header and by itself does not contain any executed operations that would be dead. The full function (shown earlier) performs side effects (closing timerfd, free(req)), so it is not dead. Note: a specific violation scenario would be if this function were registered/called but its body only contained (void)cls; (void)connection; (void)toe; and immediately returned (i.e. performed no observable side effects) \u2014 then those executed calls would be dead code because removing the function call would not affect program behaviour."
