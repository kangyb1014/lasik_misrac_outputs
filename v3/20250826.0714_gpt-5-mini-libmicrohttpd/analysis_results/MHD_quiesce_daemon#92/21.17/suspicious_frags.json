  "explanation": "I found no direct uses of the Standard Library string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided MHD_quiesce_daemon implementation. The occurrences of string literals (e.g. the messages passed to MHD_DLOG / MHD_PANIC via _(\"...\") and the \"q\" argument passed to MHD_itc_activate_) are not calls to <string.h> functions themselves. Array accesses (daemon->worker_pool[i]) are guarded by the loop condition i < daemon->worker_pool_size, so no obvious out\u2011of\u2011bounds indexing is present in this fragment. epoll_ctl and related calls do not use string.h functions here either. If any of the called helper functions (e.g. MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_DLOG, MHD_PANIC) internally call the string.h functions, those internal implementations should be inspected separately, but within this code fragment there are no direct string.h usages that would trigger Rule 21.17 and thus nothing to report for investigation."
