  "explanation": "Only fragments that perform function calls (or macro-like calls that may expand to function calls) can create direct or indirect recursion; those are listed above. The remaining code in the function consists of local variable declarations, simple assignments (e.g. ret = daemon->listen_fd; daemon->was_quiesced = true; daemon->worker_pool[i].was_quiesced = true; daemon->listen_socket_in_epoll = false;), comparisons and control flow (if/for/return), and preprocessor conditionals. These do not invoke other functions and therefore cannot by themselves create a recursive call chain to MHD_quiesce_daemon, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2. Comments and constant/macro uses that do not expand to calls were also excluded for the same reason."
