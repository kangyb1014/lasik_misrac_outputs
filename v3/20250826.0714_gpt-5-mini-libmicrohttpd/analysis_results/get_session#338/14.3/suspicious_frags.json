  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (cookie != NULL): depends on the result of MHD_lookup_connection_value, not constant.\n- while (NULL != ret): ret is initialized from sessions and is updated inside the loop (ret = ret->next), so the loop control expression is not invariant.\n- if (NULL != ret) after the loop: this depends on the outcome of the traversal and is not a compile-time or loop-invariant expression.\n- if (NULL == ret) after calloc: depends on the runtime return of calloc.\nThere are no do-while loops or other constructs with compile-time constant controlling expressions. No infinite-loop patterns with invariant conditions are present (and the allowed exceptions to Rule 14.3 do not apply). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
