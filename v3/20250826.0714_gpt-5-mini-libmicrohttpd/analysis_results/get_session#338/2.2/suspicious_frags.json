  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments in the function have clear, observable effects on program behavior and therefore are not likely to be dead code and do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 in this context: the cookie lookup and strcmp-based traversal are used to find an existing session (control-flow and input-dependent behavior); the calloc call allocates memory and the subsequent fprintf/return on failure perform I/O and control-flow that are observable; the ret->next = sessions; sessions = ret; assignments update the global session list (modifies program state); the return statements and loop control (break) affect flow of execution. These operations cannot be removed without changing program behavior, so they are not flagged here. The listed fragments should be investigated because they are operations that might be redundant (have no externally observable effect elsewhere) and thus could constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
