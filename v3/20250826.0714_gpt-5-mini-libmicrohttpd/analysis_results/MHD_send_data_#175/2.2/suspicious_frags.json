  "explanation": "I marked fragments that are likely candidates for further inspection for dead-code concerns: the tls_conn definition that is conditionally a constant false when HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined, the entire if (tls_conn) / TLS-handling block with mixed preprocessor guards (including the compiled-in fallback assignment ret = MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_), and the comment-only EPOLL_SUPPORT block inside the TLS branch. These places can lead to compiled-but-never-effective code paths or no-op blocks depending on build configuration and thus merit review for potential dead code.\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 2.2:\n- Error handling branches that map specific socket or GNUTLS error codes to distinct return values (e.g., checks for EAGAIN, EINTR, various GNUTLS error constants) have observable effects (different return codes and side effects such as epoll_state updates) and so are not candidates for dead code.\n- The plaintext-transmission branch (the else branch) performs actual sends, error checks, and state updates (including possible epoll_state modifications) which are behaviorally significant.\n- Adjustments to buffer_size and push_data are used later (affecting send size, pre_send_setopt/post_send_setopt behavior and return-value semantics), so those assignments are not dead.\n- Calls to pre_send_setopt() and post_send_setopt() and modifications of connection->epoll_state are side-effecting operations; they cannot be removed without changing observable behavior.\n- Preprocessor-guarded code (e.g., GNUTLS-specific checks, MHD_USE_MSG_MORE, EPOLL_SUPPORT) is configuration-dependent; compiled-out regions are unreachable in that configuration but not necessarily dead code in general. Each such conditional block should be reviewed in the context of the build configuration being analyzed rather than assumed dead.\n\nInvestigate the listed fragments to determine whether, in the specific build configurations in use, they become executed no-op code or otherwise violate Rule 2.2."
