  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not flagged because they perform observable operations that are used by later code or represent required control flow: the enum and variable declarations are used subsequently; each assignment to 'malgo3' in the if/else chain corresponds to a distinct algorithm choice and is passed to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3; the call assigning 'res' is the core operation whose result governs the function outcome. The flagged fragments are the only parts that could plausibly be dead or redundant in typical deployments: the panic branch might never be executed if 'algo' is always validated elsewhere, the grouped nonce-result check and the final default return may overlap with the complete set of possible return values from MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 (making one of them redundant). Other statements (declarations, assignments used later, and the call to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3) have clear uses and therefore do not warrant investigation for dead code based solely on the provided snippet."
