  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs: function definition, standard integer types (uint8_t, size_t), pointer casts, bitwise and, memcpy, while/if control flow, and preprocessor conditional (#ifndef). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values, zero-length arrays, or other documented GCC/Clang/MSVC language extensions in this snippet.\n\nNotes for investigators: the macro/function mhd_assert and the definitions of struct Md5Ctx, MD5_BLOCK_SIZE, md5_transform, and ctx->buffer are not shown here \u2014 if any of those (or other macros used) expand to compiler-specific extensions, those definitions should be inspected. Based solely on the visible code in MHD_MD5_update, there are no suspicious language-extension uses to report."
