  "explanation": "I selected the memcpy calls that cast ctx->buffer to (uint8_t *) and the calls to md5_transform because these are the places where pointer types and const-qualification may be mismatched or cast away. These fragments should be investigated to ensure that: (a) the member ctx->buffer and the parameter types of md5_transform have the appropriate const qualifiers, and (b) no const-qualified data is being cast to a non-const pointer (which would violate the intent of Rule 8.13). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'data' is already const-qualified; the parameter 'ctx' must be non-const because the function modifies the context (ctx->count, buffer contents, ctx->H); pointer arithmetic on 'data' modifies the pointer value, not the pointed-to object; the assertions and length checks do not affect pointer const-qualification. Therefore they do not indicate potential violations of Rule 8.13."
