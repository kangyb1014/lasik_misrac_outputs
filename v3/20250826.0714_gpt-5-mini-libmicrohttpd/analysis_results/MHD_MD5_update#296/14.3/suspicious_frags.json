  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant constants and therefore none that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- The preprocessor conditional #ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE is a compile-time directive, not a runtime controlling expression governed by Rule 14.3.\n- if (0 == length) depends on the function parameter length (not a compile-time constant).\n- if (0 != bytes_have) depends on bytes_have, which is computed from ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1) (not a compile-time constant for general inputs).\n- if (length >= bytes_left) depends on runtime values length and bytes_left (bytes_left depends on bytes_have and MD5_BLOCK_SIZE).\n- while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length) is not an invariant constant: it depends on the runtime value length (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE is a constant but comparing a variable to a constant does not make the controlling expression invariant).\n- if (0 != length) depends on the runtime variable length.\n- The mhd_assert((data != NULL) || (length == 0)) is a macro invocation; its argument is not a compile-time constant (it depends on the parameters passed) and the macro may expand differently in build configurations \u2014 it is not an invariant controlling expression in the sense of Rule 14.3.\n\nNone of the above control expressions are constant/invariant at compile time (e.g., while(1) or if(0)), nor are there do-while constructs covered by the stated exceptions. Therefore no code fragments in this function appear to violate Rule 14.3 and none need further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
