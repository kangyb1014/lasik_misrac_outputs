  "explanation": "No C controlling expression in this function is an invariant constant expression. The conditional tests use runtime values: 'max' (parameters) in \"if (SSIZE_MAX < max)\" and \"if (UINT_MAX < max)\", and 'n' (the result of read) in \"if (0 == n)\" and \"if (n < 0)\" \u2014 none are compile-time constant expressions. There are no loops or do-while constructs that could be an intentionally infinite loop or the allowed do-while exception. The preprocessor #ifndef/#else blocks are not C controlling expressions subject to MISRA Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for an invariant controlling expression under Rule 14.3."
