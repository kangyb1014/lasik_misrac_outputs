  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function (function signature, declarations of response and n, the final return n; and simple assignments) are straightforward, syntactically reachable code that participate in the normal execution flow and do not present obvious unreachable branches. The items selected above warrant inspection because conditional compilation makes one of the platform branches excluded in a build (potentially rendering the other branch effectively unreachable for that build) and the runtime/result checks are places where platform-dependent constants/types and special return values may make certain paths impossible on some targets. All other fragments are standard statements/returns or simple variable usage and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1 in this snippet."
