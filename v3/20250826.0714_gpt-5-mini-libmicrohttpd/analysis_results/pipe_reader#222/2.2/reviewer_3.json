  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void) pos;\u201d is an executed no\u2011op (an expression statement that has no side effects), and removing it would not change the program behaviour. That fits the definition of dead code given in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the reported violation is valid. (Note: compilers often optimize away such statements, and the statement is commonly used to silence unused\u2011parameter warnings; to comply with MISRA you should instead omit the parameter name in the function definition or use an approved mechanism/macros to indicate an intentionally unused parameter.)"
