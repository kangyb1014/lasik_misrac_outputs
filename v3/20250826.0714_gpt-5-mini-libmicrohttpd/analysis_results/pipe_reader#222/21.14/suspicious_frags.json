  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp (or to strcmp/strncmp or other string-comparison functions) appear in the provided code fragment. The function only performs integer limit checks, type casts, and a read() into a byte buffer; it does not compare C strings or use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code locations here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and no fragments need to be investigated for that rule."
