  "explanation": "No recursive calls are present in this function. The body only invokes the POSIX/system call read (or the platform-equivalent as cast), performs simple integer bounds checks and returns constants or the read result. There are no calls to pipe_reader (directly) and no calls to any other user-defined functions that could obviously call back into pipe_reader (i.e. no callbacks or function-pointer dereferences inside this function). The only function-like invocation is read, which is a system call and cannot indirectly recurse into this static function. Conditional compilation and casts do not introduce recursion. Any possible indirect recursion via external wiring (for example, if this static function pointer were registered elsewhere to be called by some code that itself is invoked from here) is not evident in this fragment and would require inspection of code outside this function; therefore, within the provided code there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
