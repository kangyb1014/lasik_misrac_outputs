  "explanation": "Only operations that invoke or pass data to string-handling routines in <string.h> (or that may lead to their use indirectly) need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The call to strlen(key) must be checked because strlen requires a properly null-terminated object and can read beyond bounds if 'key' does not point to a NUL-terminated char array. The call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (and its arguments pos->header, key, pos->header_size) should be investigated because that function may internally use standard string.h functions (e.g. memcmp, strncmp, etc.) or otherwise perform memory accesses based on the provided length; passing incorrect lengths or non-terminated buffers could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. Other parts of the function \u2014 the loop over response->first_header, the comparison pos->header_size == key_size, the NULL check for key, and the return statements \u2014 do not themselves invoke string.h functions and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
