  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: key_size is computed with strlen(key) and the comparison call is only made when pos->header_size == key_size, so the comparison is for exactly key_size bytes. Provided that MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ only reads the n bytes passed and that pos->header actually points to at least pos->header_size bytes, there is no out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. A violation would occur if MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ internally accessed beyond the requested n bytes (for example, expecting null-terminated strings and reading the terminator or further), or if pos->header_size does not reflect the actual allocated size of pos->header (e.g. header buffer shorter than pos->header_size)."
