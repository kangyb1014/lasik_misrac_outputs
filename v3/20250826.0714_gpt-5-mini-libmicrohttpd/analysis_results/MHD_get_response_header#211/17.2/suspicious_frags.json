  "explanation": "Only these two expressions in the function are function calls and therefore could participate in indirect recursion: the call to strlen and the call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_. All other fragments in the function are control flow, pointer traversal, comparisons, NULL checks and return statements (for example the for-loop iterating pos = pos->next, the NULL checks on key and pos, and the return statements). Those do not perform function calls and thus cannot directly or indirectly invoke MHD_get_response_header, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
