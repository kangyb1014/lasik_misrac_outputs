Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_header:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *key)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n  size_t key_size;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n    return NULL;\n\n  key_size = strlen (key);\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_size) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos->value;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(pos->header_size == key_size)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated: the equality check (pos->header_size == key_size) is an active conditional that influences whether the subsequent string comparison is performed and therefore affects program behaviour. It is not dead code. (A hypothetical violation would occur only if it could be proven that pos->header_size is always equal to key_size in all executions \u2014 in that contrived case the check would be executed but its removal would not change behaviour.)"
