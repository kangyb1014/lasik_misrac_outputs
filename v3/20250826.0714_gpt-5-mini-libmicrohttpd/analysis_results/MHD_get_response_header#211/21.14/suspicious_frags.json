  "explanation": "All other lines in the function are simple control/variable declarations, a NULL check, loop iteration, or a plain return and do not perform string comparisons or call library routines that could map to memcmp. The only places that can lead to use of memcmp (directly or via a helper) are the strlen call that obtains the length of a null\u2011terminated string and the subsequent binary string comparison call MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_. Those fragments should be investigated to determine whether memcmp is (directly or indirectly) being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings. No other fragments in this function warrant investigation under Rule 21.14."
