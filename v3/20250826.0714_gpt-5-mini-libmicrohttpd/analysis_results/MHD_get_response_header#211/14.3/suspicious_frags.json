  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Specifically:\n- if (NULL == key): depends on the function parameter key and is not a compile-time constant.\n- for (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next): the loop condition depends on pos, which is updated each iteration (pos = pos->next), so it is not invariant and does not create a constant controlling expression.\n- if ((pos->header_size == key_size) && (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_(...))): this conditional depends on pos->header_size, key_size (computed from strlen(key) at runtime), and the result of a function call using pos->header; these are runtime-varying values, not invariant expressions.\nThere are no do-while or other constructs with constant controlling expressions, and no obvious intentional infinite-loop invariant conditions. Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
