  "explanation": "Other fragments in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameters are already declared as pointers to const-qualified char (const char *param_name, const char *param_tail, const char *next_param), which conforms to the rule; the local non-pointer variable (param_value) and its address (&param_value) are used as an output argument so the pointee must be mutable and thus should not be const; the assignment to tool_params.threads uses a non-pointer value; and the conditional checks/returns contain no pointer declarations or conversions. The listed fragments are the places where pointer const-qualification might be at issue (calls that forward these string pointers into other functions or varargs), so they should be inspected further to ensure the called functions accept const-qualified pointers where appropriate."
