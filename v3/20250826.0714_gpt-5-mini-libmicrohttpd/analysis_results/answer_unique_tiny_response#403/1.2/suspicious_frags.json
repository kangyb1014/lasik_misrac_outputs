  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically, the code does not use any of the common compiler-specific extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, such as: __attribute__ or other double-underscore attributes, __asm__ or inline assembly, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions (GCC extension), nested functions, computed gotos, zero-length arrays as an extension, GNU inline semantics, or other documented compiler-specific keywords or constructs. The casts present (e.g. (void *) &marker and (void *) tiny_body) and the suppression idiom (void) var are standard C usage (though casting away constness can be an issue for other MISRA rules, it is not a compiler language extension). The preprocessor conditionals and macro usages (MHD_VERSION, MHD_create_response_from_buffer, etc.) are standard preprocessor constructs, not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
