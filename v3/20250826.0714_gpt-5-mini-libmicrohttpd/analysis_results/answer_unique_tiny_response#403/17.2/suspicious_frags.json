  "explanation": "There are no explicit calls to answer_unique_tiny_response within this function, so no direct self-call is present. Most remaining lines are simple parameter casts, local declarations, or strcmp checks (e.g. the method checks) which are standard library calls that do not invoke user callbacks and thus do not introduce indirect recursion. The only places that may result in the server library re-entering this request handler (indirect recursion) are: the initial/early-return handshake that sets *req_cls and returns MHD_YES (the framework may call the handler again later), and calls into the microhttpd API that queue/create/destroy responses. Those API calls are listed above as suspicious fragments and should be investigated to determine whether they can cause the library to call this handler (directly or indirectly). All other code fragments (parameter (void) casts, enum/variable declarations, strcmp-based method checks, return MHD_NO for unsupported method, and the final return ret) do not perform callbacks and therefore do not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
