  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) url; and (void) version; idioms are used to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics. They do not perform any runtime action or side effect; they are not the kind of executed operations that Rule 2.2 targets. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; these cast-to-void statements do not constitute executed operations with runtime effect (and are idiomatic annotations), so they are not \u2018dead code\u2019 under the intent of the rule. Therefore the claimed violation is incorrect."
