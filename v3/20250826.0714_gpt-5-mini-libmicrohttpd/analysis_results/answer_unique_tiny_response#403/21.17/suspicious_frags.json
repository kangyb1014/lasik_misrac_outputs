  "explanation": "Only the shown fragments use string handling facilities or macros that likely rely on string lengths. The rest of the function contains no other calls to <string.h> functions (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so there are no additional places in this function that could violate Rule 21.17. Any other statements (casts, void casts to suppress unused warnings, pointer assignments, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response calls, the marker handling, and returns) do not perform string accesses and therefore need not be investigated for this specific rule."
