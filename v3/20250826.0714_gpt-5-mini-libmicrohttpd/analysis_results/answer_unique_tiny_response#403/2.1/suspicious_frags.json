  "explanation": "Other code in the function does not appear to contain statically unreachable statements and therefore does not need investigation for Rule 2.1: - The (void) casts for unused parameters and the static declaration of marker are simple declarations/expressions and are always reachable/used for their intended purpose. - The response-queueing sequence (MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, return ret) is reachable when *req_cls is non-NULL and the method is GET or HEAD; these are normal, intended control paths. - The early returns in the listed fragments are control-flow decisions that deliberately short-circuit processing (first-call handling and unsupported-method handling) rather than dead code; they are flagged above because they cause other code to be unreachable in those specific invocation cases and thus warrant review. - There are no obvious syntactically dead statements (code after an unconditional return in the same block) other than the early-return fragments already listed. Therefore only the listed fragments require further investigation for potential unreachable-code issues under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
