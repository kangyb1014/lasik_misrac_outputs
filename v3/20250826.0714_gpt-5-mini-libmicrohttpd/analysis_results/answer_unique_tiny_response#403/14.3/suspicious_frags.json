  "explanation": "I examined all controlling expressions in the function: \n\n- if (NULL == *req_cls)\n  Reason not suspicious: This depends on the runtime value pointed to by req_cls (set by the caller/library across invocations). It is not a compile-time constant/invariant \u2014 it detects the first-call case and therefore can evaluate differently across calls.\n\n- if ((0 != strcmp (method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) &&\n      (0 != strcmp (method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD)))\n  Reason not suspicious: This depends on the runtime value of method and the results of strcmp; it is not invariant.\n\n- #if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 / #else / #endif\n  Reason not suspicious: This is a preprocessor conditional (compile-time configuration), not a C controlling expression governed by MISRA C Rule 14.3.\n\nThere are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions in this function, and no other conditionals that are compile-time constants. Therefore no code fragments in this function need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
