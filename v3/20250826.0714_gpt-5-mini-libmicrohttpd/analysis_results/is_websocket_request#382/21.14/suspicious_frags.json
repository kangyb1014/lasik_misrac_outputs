  "explanation": "No occurrence of memcmp was found in the provided function. The code uses strcmp and strstr to operate on null\u2011terminated strings; strcmp is the appropriate standard function for comparing null\u2011terminated strings, and both upg_header and con_header are checked for NULL before use. Therefore there are no fragments that potentially violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this code."
