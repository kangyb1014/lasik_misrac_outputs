  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_websocket_request:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nis_websocket_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, const char *upg_header,\n                      const char *con_header)\n{\n\n  (void) con;  /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The conditional expression and its subexpressions (upg_header != NULL, con_header != NULL, strcmp, strstr) are evaluated at runtime to decide whether to return MHD_YES or MHD_NO; removing any of these operations would change program behaviour. The code is reachable and not redundant, so it does not constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
