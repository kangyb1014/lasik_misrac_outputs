Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of is_websocket_request.\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nis_websocket_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, const char *upg_header,\n                      const char *con_header)\n{\n\n  (void) con;  /* Unused.

It has no side effects at runtime and removing it would not change program behaviour (only compiler diagnostics), therefore it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement '(void) con;' is an expression statement that has no side effects at runtime and whose removal would not change the program behaviour; therefore it meets the rule text for \"dead code\" in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If the expression referenced a volatile object or had other side effects the conclusion could be different, but in the provided code it does not.) Note: this idiom is commonly used to silence compiler diagnostics about unused parameters; that practice is widespread, but under a strict reading of Rule 2.2 it is dead code and thus a violation unless an allowed justification/annotation or other mitigation (e.g. removing the parameter name from the function prototype, using a compiler attribute or a project-allowed macro to mark the parameter unused) is applied."
