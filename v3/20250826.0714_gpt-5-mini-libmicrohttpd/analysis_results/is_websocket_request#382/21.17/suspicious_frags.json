  ],
  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17: the explicit null-pointer checks (upg_header != NULL) and (con_header != NULL) appear immediately before the string-function calls and, given C's left-to-right short-circuit evaluation of &&, will prevent those functions being invoked with a NULL pointer. The (void) con; line only suppresses an unused-parameter warning and does not perform any string/ memory access. No other uses of <string.h> functions or pointer-based string accesses are present in this function."
