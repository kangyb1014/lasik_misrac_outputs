  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code. All constructs are standard ISO C: - function definition with 'static' and 'enum' return type, - parameter list with pointer types and 'const' qualifiers, - the use of a (void) con; cast to suppress an unused-parameter warning (standard idiom), - standard library functions strcmp and strstr, - NULL and string literals, - the conditional (?:) operator and macro-like identifiers MHD_YES / MHD_NO (these are identifiers, not language extensions). There are no compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, inline assembler, nested functions, nonstandard pragmas, or other documented compiler-specific constructs. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
