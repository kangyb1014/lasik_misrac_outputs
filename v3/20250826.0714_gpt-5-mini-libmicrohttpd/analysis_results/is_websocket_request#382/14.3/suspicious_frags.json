  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only selection used is the conditional (?:) operator whose controlling expression is ((upg_header != NULL) && (con_header != NULL) && (0 == strcmp (upg_header, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE)) && (NULL != strstr (con_header, \"Upgrade\"))). This expression depends on the function parameters and the results of strcmp and strstr, so it is not invariant and does not violate Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or if/switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The (void) con; statement merely suppresses an unused-parameter warning and is not a controlling expression. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
