  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code only uses standard C constructs: 'static', 'int', function definition, 'if' statements, equality and logical operators, function calls (MHD_is_feature_supported, fprintf), and 'return' statements. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, #pragma with vendor names, inline assembly, or other documented compiler extensions. The macros (MHD_NO, MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL) and the function MHD_is_feature_supported are library-defined symbols, not compiler language extensions. Note: the identifier contains a double underscore (check_param__epoll) which is reserved by the implementation per the C standard, but this is a namespace/reservation issue rather than a compiler language-extension usage and therefore is not reported under Rule 1.2 here."
