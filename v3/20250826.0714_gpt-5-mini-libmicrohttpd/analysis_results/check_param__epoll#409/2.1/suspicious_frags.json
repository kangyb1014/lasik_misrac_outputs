  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasoning:\n\n- The first return (\"if (! tool_params.epoll) return ! 0;\") is conditional on the runtime value of tool_params.epoll, so it can be reached when that condition is true.\n- The second conditional (\"if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL)) { ... return 0; }\") is also conditional and therefore reachable when the runtime result of MHD_is_feature_supported(...) equals MHD_NO; the fprintf and the return 0 are inside that conditional and are not syntactically unreachable.\n- The final \"return ! 0;\" is reachable when the previous two conditionals do not trigger a return.\n- There are no statements following an unconditional return within the same block, no dead labels, no unconditional infinite loops, and no sequence of code that is impossible to reach purely from the source shown.\n\nNote: If macros or external configuration make expressions like MHD_is_feature_supported(...) expand to compile-time constant expressions (for example always MHD_NO or always MHD_YES), one of the branches could be provably always taken/never taken in the whole-program sense. That would require cross-file/project analysis (expansion of macros, build-time configuration) beyond this single function. Based on the local view of the function alone, there is no unreachable code to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
