  "explanation": "I found no pointer declarations or pointer-type variables in the provided function that could be const-qualified. The only pointer-like usages are: (1) the call to fprintf with stderr (a FILE * required to be non-const because the stream is modified), and (2) string literals passed as the format argument (string literals have static storage and are used where a const char * is expected). The call to MHD_is_feature_supported and the accesses to tool_params.epoll use non-pointer types. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
