  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__epoll:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__epoll (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.epoll)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"'epoll' was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support 'epoll' functionality.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment 'return ! 0;' evaluates to 'return 1;' and is executed on defined input paths (early return when !tool_params.epoll, and the final return when epoll is requested and supported). Removing that return would change the function behavior (either remove a return value or alter the returned value), so it is not dead code and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
