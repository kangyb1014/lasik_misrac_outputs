  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided function. The code simply marks add_footer and add_footer_size as unused, asserts a connection field, and calls a project-specific function transmit_error_response_static. There are no string comparisons (no memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or manual byte-wise comparisons) and no use of memcmp on potentially null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
