  "explanation": "The provided target code contains only this single function; there are no other code fragments in the snippet to consider. The entire function is reported so reviewers can investigate: (a) whether the static function is actually referenced (a static, unreferenced function would be unreachable/dead code), (b) the definition of mhd_assert (it may be a macro that changes control flow or is compiled out), and (c) any build/configuration conditions that could make the function body unreachable. No other constructs (e.g. code after return, conditional branches, loops, or additional functions/statements) are present in the supplied snippet, so there are no additional fragments to report."
