  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions of selection/iteration constructs (if, switch, for, while, do-while). The supplied function contains no selection or iteration statements whose controlling expression could be invariant:\n\n- The two lines \"(void) add_footer; (void) add_footer_size;\" are only unused-parameter casts and are not controlling expressions.\n- The mhd_assert(c->rq.have_chunked_upload); (if expanded to a conditional) uses the runtime field c->rq.have_chunked_upload and therefore is not an invariant constant expression.\n- The call to transmit_error_response_static(...) is a function call, not a controlling expression.\n\nThere are no while/for/do-while/if/switch constructs with constant conditions in the provided code, so no fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
