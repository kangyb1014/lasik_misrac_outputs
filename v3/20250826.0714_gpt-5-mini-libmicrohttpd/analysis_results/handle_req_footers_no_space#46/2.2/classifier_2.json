The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_req_footers_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_req_footers_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                             const char *add_footer,\n                             size_t add_footer_size)\n{\n  (void) add_footer; (void) add_footer_size; /* Unused */\n  mhd_assert (c->rq.have_chunked_upload);\n\n  /* Footers should be optional */\n  transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE,\n                                  ERR_MSG_REQUEST_FOOTER_TOO_BIG);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_req_footers_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                             const char *add_footer,\n                             size_t add_footer_size)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation for the shown fragment. The text shown is just the function signature (no executable statements) and therefore contains no executed operations that could be classified as dead code. Note: in the fuller function body the common idiom \u201c(void)add_footer; (void)add_footer_size;\u201d are no-op casts to silence unused-parameter warnings \u2014 those statements have no runtime effect and their removal would not change program behaviour, so a strict reading of Rule 2.2 could treat them as dead code. However, based on the provided fragment (the signature only) there is no violation."
