  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that could be const-qualified. add_footer is already const-qualified and therefore not suspicious. add_footer_size is not a pointer type. The only pointer parameter in this function is 'struct MHD_Connection *c' and every use of a pointer in the body (mhd_assert and transmit_error_response_static) refers to that same parameter; no other pointer variables are declared or used in this function. Therefore only the occurrences shown (the function signature and the places where 'c' is used) need investigation to determine whether 'c' could be a pointer to a const-qualified type. No other fragments in this function are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
