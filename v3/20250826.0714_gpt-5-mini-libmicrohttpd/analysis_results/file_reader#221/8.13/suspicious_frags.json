  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - 'char *buf' is the destination buffer for read/pread/readfile and is written to, so it must be a non-const pointer. The underlying OS APIs (read/pread/ReadFile) require a writable buffer (void *), so const qualification is not appropriate. - The casts to (void *) buf and the use of APIs like read/pread/lseek/ReadFile match the required mutable buffer semantics. - Local pointer-like objects (e.g., HANDLE fh is declared const already) are either not pointers to object data that could be const-qualified or are intentionally non-const because they represent handles or API-required types. - Integer parameters (pos, max) and non-pointer local variables are irrelevant to Rule 8.13. Therefore only the function parameter 'cls' / its immediate use as 'struct MHD_Response *response' appears to be a candidate for const-qualification and is reported."
