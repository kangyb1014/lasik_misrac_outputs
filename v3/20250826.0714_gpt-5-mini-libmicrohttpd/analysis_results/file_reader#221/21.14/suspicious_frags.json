  "explanation": "I inspected the entire file_reader function and found no uses of the standard library function memcmp (nor any wrappers or aliases of memcmp) that could be used to compare null-terminated strings. The code only performs file I/O and numeric checks (e.g. offset64 < 0, max > SSIZE_MAX, comparisons of off_t/uint64_t sizes) and calls system I/O functions (pread64, pread, lseek64, lseek, read, ReadFile). There are no string comparisons or calls that would use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, so there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this file."
