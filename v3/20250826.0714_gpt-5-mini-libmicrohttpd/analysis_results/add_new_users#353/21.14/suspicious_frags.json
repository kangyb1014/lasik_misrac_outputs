  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function body for any uses of the C standard library function memcmp (or any direct comparison of null\u2011terminated strings using memcmp). There are no calls to memcmp, no reinterpretation of string buffers, and no explicit comparisons of C strings in this fragment. The function only calls add_new_user_entry with string literals and boolean flags; those call sites themselves do not contain memcmp invocations. Therefore, within this code fragment there are no occurrences that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If add_new_user_entry's implementation is available, it should be inspected separately, but that is outside the provided fragment.)"
