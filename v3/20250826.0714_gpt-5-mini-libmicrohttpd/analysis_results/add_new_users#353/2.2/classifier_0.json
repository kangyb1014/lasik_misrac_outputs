  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_new_users:\n```c\nstatic int\nadd_new_users (void)\n{\n  if (! add_new_user_entry (\"joepublic\",\n                            \"password\",\n                            REALM,\n                            ! 0,\n                            0))\n    return 0;\n\n  if (! add_new_user_entry (\"superadmin\",\n                            \"pA$$w0Rd\",\n                            REALM,\n                            ! 0,\n                            ! 0))\n    return 0;\n\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! add_new_user_entry (\"superadmin\",\n                            \"pA$$w0Rd\",\n                            REALM,\n                            ! 0,\n                            ! 0))\n    return 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The two arguments written as '! 0' are constant expressions: '!0' evaluates to 1. The logical negation operations are executed solely to produce a compile-time constant value and have no side-effects; removing the '!' operations (replacing with literal 1) would not change program behaviour. Those redundant operations therefore constitute dead code and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
