The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of add_new_users:\n```c\nstatic int\nadd_new_users (void)\n{\n  if (! add_new_user_entry (\"joepublic\",\n                            \"password\",\n                            REALM,\n                            ! 0,\n                            0))\n    return 0;\n\n  if (! add_new_user_entry (\"superadmin\",\n                            \"pA$$w0Rd\",\n                            REALM,\n                            ! 0,\n                            ! 0))\n    return 0;\n\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic int\nadd_new_users (void)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No \u2014 the fragment by itself does not demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation. The snippet is only the start of a static function definition; there is no evidence here that the function contains executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If the function is never called, it is unreachable (Note 2) rather than dead code. A violation could occur in a concrete scenario where the function is actually executed but all of its effects are redundant \u2014 for example, callers invoke add_new_users(), its internal calls have no observable side effects (e.g. stubbed add_new_user_entry that always succeeds and does nothing externally), and callers ignore the return value; in that case the executed operations could be removed without changing program behaviour and would violate Rule 2.2."
