The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the fragments listed above are potentially relevant to Rule 2.2 (dead code) and should be investigated: the static function declaration (static linkage can make a function dead if never referenced), the calls/conditionals that control early returns, and the final return using a constant expression. No other code constructs are present in the snippet that would constitute dead code: there are no additional functions, unused variables, statements following an unconditional return, or unreachable labelled blocks in this fragment. Initialization-vs-assignment considerations and the absence of unreachable code (no code that can never be executed) mean there are no further candidates for dead-code inspection in this snippet."
