  "explanation": "Only calls to other functions can participate in indirect recursion. The two if-statements that call add_new_user_entry are potentially part of an indirect recursion cycle (if add_new_user_entry, directly or indirectly, calls add_new_users). Other parts of the function do not perform function calls that could create recursion: the function signature, the simple return statements (return 0; and return ! 0;), use of constants and the REALM macro do not by themselves introduce calls, so they need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
