  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function uses any compiler-specific language extensions. The function contains only standard C constructs: a static function definition, if/else statements, function calls, and return statements. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__ (or other __attribute__ forms), asm/inline assembly, typeof, __builtin_... functions, __extension__, GCC statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), or other vendor-specific keywords or syntactic extensions. Identifier names with double underscores are implementation-reserved identifiers but are not language extensions per se; Rule 1.2 requires reporting explicit compiler language extensions as documented by the compiler, and none appear in this snippet."
