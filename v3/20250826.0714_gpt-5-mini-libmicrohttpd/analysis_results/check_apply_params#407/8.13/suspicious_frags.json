  "explanation": "No pointer types are used in the provided code fragment. The function contains only: structure-member accesses via the dot operator (tool_params.help and tool_params.version), calls to other functions, integer/boolean conditionals, and integer return values. There are no pointer declarations, no address-of (&) or dereference (*) operators, and no use of the arrow operator (->) that would indicate a pointer to a struct. Therefore, within this fragment there are no pointer objects that could be made to point to const-qualified types and nothing that directly triggers Rule 8.13. Note: the called functions and other code outside this fragment might use pointers and should be reviewed separately, but they are not part of the given code and thus are not reported here."
