  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp are present in this code fragment, nor are there any byte-wise comparisons of character arrays or pointers to null-terminated strings. The conditionals operate on boolean-like fields (e.g. tool_params.help, tool_params.version) and the code only calls other functions (show_help, print_version, various check_* functions) and returns integer constants. Therefore there is no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings in this fragment. (Note: if memcmp usage exists, it would be inside the called functions; those are outside the provided fragment and would need separate review.)"
