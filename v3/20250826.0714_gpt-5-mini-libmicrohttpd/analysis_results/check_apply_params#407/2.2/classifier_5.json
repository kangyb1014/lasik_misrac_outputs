Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_params:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_params (void)\n{\n  if (tool_params.help)\n  {\n    show_help ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  else if (tool_params.version)\n  {\n    print_version ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  check_param_port ();\n  check_apply_param__all_cpus ();\n  check_apply_param__threads ();\n  if (! check_apply_param__thread_per_conn ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__epoll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__poll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large ();\n  check_param__shared_single_unique ();\n  if (! check_param__connections ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncheck_apply_param__all_cpus ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not enough information to prove dead code. The call check_apply_param__all_cpus() is not inherently dead \u2014 if the function modifies global configuration, performs validation, I/O, volatile accesses, synchronization, or otherwise has observable side effects, removing the call would change program behaviour. A specific violation would occur if the function is implemented as an empty (no-op) body or only performs computations whose results are unused and has no observable side effects (no globals, no volatile/I/O/synchronization, no timing effects); in that case the call would be dead and Rule 2.2 violated."
