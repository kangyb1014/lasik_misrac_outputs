Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_params:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_params (void)\n{\n  if (tool_params.help)\n  {\n    show_help ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  else if (tool_params.version)\n  {\n    print_version ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  check_param_port ();\n  check_apply_param__all_cpus ();\n  check_apply_param__threads ();\n  if (! check_apply_param__thread_per_conn ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__epoll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__poll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large ();\n  check_param__shared_single_unique ();\n  if (! check_param__connections ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncheck_param_port ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If check_param_port() performs only a query/validation and returns a status which is ignored here (i.e. it has no observable side effects such as setting global state, printing diagnostics, or modifying program state used later), then this call is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 therefore it is dead code. (If, conversely, check_param_port() produces observable side effects, the call is not dead.)"
