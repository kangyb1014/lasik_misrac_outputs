  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim as stated is not definitively correct. Rule 2.2 forbids dead code \u2014 i.e. executed operations whose removal would not change program behaviour. From the snippet alone we cannot determine whether the call to check_param_port() (and several other calls whose results are ignored) has observable side effects. If check_param_port() is a pure query that returns a status which is ignored and it has no other observable effects (no global state changes, no logging/diagnostics, no timing effects that matter), then that call is indeed dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Conversely, if the function does produce observable side effects (mutates globals, emits diagnostics, initializes state, affects timing, etc.), the call is not dead and there is no violation.\n\nSo Agent A\u2019s scenario describes a valid potential violation, but the report as an absolute statement that the code violates Rule 2.2 is not justified by the snippet alone. To resolve: inspect the implementation of check_param_port() (and other functions whose return values are ignored). If they are pure and their return values are unused, either remove the calls, use the return values, or change the function signatures to void (or otherwise document/justify the side effects) to satisfy MISRA requirements."
