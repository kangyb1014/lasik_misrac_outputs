In that case the call is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct in principle but the reported violation cannot be established from the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 indeed treats an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour as dead code. Therefore, if check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large() has no observable side\u2011effects (no modifications of globals/volatile objects, no I/O, no effects relied on indirectly, and its removal does not change timing or other externally observable behaviour), then the call would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2. However, the code fragment does not show the implementation of check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large() (or whether its behaviour is relied upon indirectly or for timing), so you cannot conclude a violation from this excerpt alone. You must inspect the called function (and any timing/volatile/side\u2011effect consequences) to determine whether the call is dead. Consequently the report asserting a definite violation is not justified based solely on the provided code."
