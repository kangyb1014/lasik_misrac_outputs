  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_version:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_version (void)\n{\n#ifdef PACKAGE_VERSION\n  return PACKAGE_VERSION;\n#else  /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n  static char ver[12] = \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\";\n  if (0 == ver[0])\n  {\n    int res = MHD_snprintf_ (ver,\n                             sizeof(ver),\n                             \"%x.%x.%x\",\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 24) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 16) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 8) & 0xFF));\n    if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res))\n      return \"0.0.0\"; /* Can't return real version */\n  }\n  return ver;\n#endif /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == ver[0])\n  {\n    int res = MHD_snprintf_ (ver,\n                             sizeof(ver),\n                             \"%x.%x.%x\",\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 24) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 16) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 8) & 0xFF));\n    if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res))\n      return \"0.0.0\"; /* Can't return real version */\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs lazy initialization of the static buffer 'ver'. ver is initialized to NULs, so on the first call the condition (0 == ver[0]) is true and the snprintf call and the subsequent test can affect behavior (they populate ver or return \"0.0.0\"). Removing these operations would change program behaviour, so they are not dead. Subsequent calls skip the block because ver has been set, but that does not make the code dead\u2014it is executed at least once and is therefore live."
