  "explanation": "No function parameters exist in MHD_get_version (its signature is void), so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable within this function. All assignments and modifications in the body act on a local static array (ver) or local variables (res), not on any function parameters. The call to MHD_snprintf_ passes ver (a pointer to the local buffer) and may modify the buffer contents \u2014 this is permitted by the rule (the object pointed to may be modified; only the pointer parameter itself must not be reassigned). Returning ver (a pointer to a static object) and returning string literals are not modifications of function parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 17.8. If further assurance is needed, inspect the implementation of MHD_snprintf_ to confirm it does not attempt to reassign its pointer-parameter variable (reassigning a callee\u2019s parameter would be a separate violation in that callee, not here)."
