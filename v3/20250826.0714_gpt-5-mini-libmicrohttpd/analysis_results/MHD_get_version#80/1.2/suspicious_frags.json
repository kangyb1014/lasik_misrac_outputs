  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code text. I scanned for common, documented compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof (a GCC extension), __extension__, __inline__ (non-standard forms), or other vendor-specific keywords/constructs; none appear. The identifiers that might look unusual (_MHD_EXTERN, MHD_snprintf_) are ordinary macro/function identifiers in the source as given \u2014 their expansions are not visible here, so there is no explicit extension text to report. All other constructs (static local array initialization, casts, stdint types like uint32_t, bit shifts, preprocessor #ifdef/#else, string literals, return statements) are standard C and do not constitute documented compiler language extensions."
