  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the provided function. The body contains a single return statement that calls MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 with constant-sized array and macro arguments; there are no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) operators in this fragment. Therefore Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) cannot be violated in this code snippet. The use of macros (MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) and the array parameter are not control expressions and do not require investigation under Rule 14.3. If violations exist, they would be inside MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 or other code not shown here."
