  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). The function body consists solely of a single return statement that directly forwards to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 \u2014 there are no conditional branches, loops, labels, or statements following the return that could be unreachable. The array-typed parameter (const uint8_t digest[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE]) is just a function parameter declaration (decays to a pointer) and does not introduce unreachable code. The use of macros (MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5) are compile-time constants and do not create unreachable code in this snippet. Therefore there are no parts of this code fragment that need further investigation for unreachable-code violations."
