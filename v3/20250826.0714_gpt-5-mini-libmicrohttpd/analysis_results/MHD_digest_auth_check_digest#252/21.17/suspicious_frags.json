  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function. The code contains no calls to any <string.h> routines (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and performs only a direct forwarding call to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2, passing the digest pointer and an explicit size (MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE). There is no buffer manipulation or pointer arithmetic here that could itself cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. Any potential violations involving string handling would occur in the callee (MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2) or other functions that actually operate on realm, username or digest; those functions should be inspected for use of <string.h> functions and correct bounds checks. Therefore no fragments inside this function require investigation for Rule 21.17."
