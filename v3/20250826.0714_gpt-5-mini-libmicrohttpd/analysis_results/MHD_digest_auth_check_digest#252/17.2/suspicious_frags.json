  "explanation": "The shown function does not call itself directly; it is a thin wrapper that forwards its arguments to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2. There are no other function calls, function pointer uses, or control-flow constructs in this snippet that would indicate recursion. To fully determine compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2, the implementation of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (and any functions it calls) must be inspected to rule out indirect recursion back to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest or any other cycle. No other fragments in this snippet require investigation for Rule 17.2 because they are declarations/parameter lists or a single return statement performing the forwarding call."
