  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in this function. The code does not call or use memcmp, nor does it perform any string comparisons of null-terminated strings. The digest parameter is a uint8_t array of fixed size (MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) and the explicit length is passed to the callee (MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2), so this function only forwards a fixed-size binary buffer and does not compare C-strings. The const char *realm and const char *username are only forwarded and not compared here. Any potential MISRA Rule 21.14 concern (use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) would have to be investigated in the implementation of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 or other functions called there, but there is no evidence of such a violation in the provided code fragment."
