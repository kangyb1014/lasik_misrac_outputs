  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_digest_auth_check_digest (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              const char *realm,\n                              const char *username,\n                              const uint8_t digest[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE],\n                              unsigned int nonce_timeout)\n{\n  return MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        username,\n                                        digest,\n                                        MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE,\n                                        nonce_timeout,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_digest_auth_check_digest (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                              const char *realm,\n                              const char *username,\n                              const uint8_t digest[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE],\n                              unsigned int nonce_timeout)\n{\n  return MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (connection,\n                                        realm,\n                                        username,\n                                        digest,\n                                        MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE,\n                                        nonce_timeout,\n                                        MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The function as shown is a thin wrapper that forwards to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2. On its own there is no evidence it is dead code. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated by this fragment. A concrete violation scenario would be if this wrapper is never referenced (no calls from the project, not needed for linkage/API compatibility) \u2014 i.e. it is compiled and executed never; in that case removal would not affect behaviour and it would be dead code."
