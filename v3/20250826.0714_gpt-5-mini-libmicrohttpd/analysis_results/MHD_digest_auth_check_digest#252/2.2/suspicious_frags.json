  "explanation": "I flagged the wrapper function and its internal call (and the use of the specific constants) because this function simply forwards its parameters to another function with fixed constant arguments; such wrappers can be redundant or constitute executed code whose removal may not change program behaviour and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code. I did not flag other tokens (such as the storage-specifier macro _MHD_EXTERN, the function name, parameter types, braces, or comments) because they are declarations/syntactic elements rather than executed operations that could be removed without affecting behaviour. Also, unreachable-code considerations cannot be determined from this single translation-unit snippet, so I did not mark any code as unreachable \u2014 only items that might represent redundant executed operations were reported."
