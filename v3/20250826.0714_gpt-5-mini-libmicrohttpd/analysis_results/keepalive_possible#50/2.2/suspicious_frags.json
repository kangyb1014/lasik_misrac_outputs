  "explanation": "The fragments selected above are potential candidates for dead-code inspection (assertions and the local alias initialisations, plus the code that redundantly dereferences \"connection\" instead of the alias). The rest of the function consists of conditional tests, header lookups, flag checks and return statements that directly affect control flow and observable behaviour (e.g. calls to MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci, flag tests, version checks and all return statements). Those operations are control-flow decisions or API calls that can change the function result and therefore should not be considered dead code without further evidence. The #ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT block is conditional on a compile-time macro (not simply dead at runtime) and contains checks and an early return that affect behaviour when enabled, so it also should not be treated as dead code by default."
