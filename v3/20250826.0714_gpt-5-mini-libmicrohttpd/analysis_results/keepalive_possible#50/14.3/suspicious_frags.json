  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. That rule concerns invariant controlling expressions (particularly for/while/do-while loop controls). This function contains no iteration statements (no for, while or do-while). All conditional (if) expressions depend on runtime data or function calls (fields of the connection/response structures or calls such as MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT) and therefore are not manifestly invariant. The preprocessor conditional (#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT) is a compile-time inclusion directive and not a C controlling expression subject to this rule. Given the absence of loop controlling expressions and that each runtime check depends on variables or function results, there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
