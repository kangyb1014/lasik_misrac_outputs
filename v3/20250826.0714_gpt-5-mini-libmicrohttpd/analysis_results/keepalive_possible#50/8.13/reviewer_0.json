True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe expression uses c->rq.http_ver where c is declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;'. The pointer points to a non-const-qualified object even though the function only reads fields (no modification of *c). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. use 'const struct MHD_Connection *const c' and declare the parameter as 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection').\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function never modifies the pointed-to MHD_Connection object \u2014 it only reads fields \u2014 yet the local alias is declared as \"struct MHD_Connection *const c\" (a const pointer to a non-const object) and the parameter is \"struct MHD_Connection *connection\" (a non-const pointer). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, pointers should point to a const-qualified type wherever possible, so both the parameter and the local alias could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (for example: \"const struct MHD_Connection *connection\" and \"const struct MHD_Connection *const c\").\n\nOne practical caveat: changing these to const is only possible if all callees invoked within this function accept a pointer-to-const (i.e. you are not required to pass the pointer to functions that expect a non-const pointer). If some called functions require a non-const pointer, you cannot safely add const without adjusting those prototypes; using casts to discard const would defeat the purpose and would itself be contrary to MISRA guidance. Since keepalive_possible is static, changing its parameter to const is likely safe in practice, but you must check the prototypes of the functions called with c/connection before making the change."
