  "explanation": "The listed fragments deserve investigation because they contain returns or assertions that hint at mutually exclusive conditions or assumptions that may make some code paths impossible (unreachable) depending on configuration/macros and the set of supported HTTP versions. Other parts of the function (alias declarations, simple flag/header checks, early returns such as \"if (MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE == c->keepalive) return ...\", and the header lookup that returns MUST_CLOSE) are straightforward conditional checks whose reachability depends on runtime data or compile-time macros; they do not by themselves indicate statically unreachable code and therefore do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1. In particular, many checks are guarding distinct runtime conditions (flags, headers, version checks) and are not obviously impossible to reach without additional semantic information about the macros and invariants; so they were not included in the suspicious list."
