  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged for further investigation because they are most likely to contain operations that might be redundant or intentionally disabled and therefore candidates for dead-code analysis. The remaining code in the function should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because it performs essential, executed operations that affect program behaviour: creating the response buffer, checking for NULL and returning MHD_NO on failure, queuing the response, destroying the response, and returning the final result (or calling reply_with_page_not_found for unknown URLs). The page_content array and its computed length are used by the response creation and thus are not dead. The core control flow (the URL comparison that selects the active branch and the final fallback return) is reachable and required for correct behaviour."
