  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameters are: 'struct MHD_Connection *c' and 'const char *url'. There are no assignments, increments/decrements, or any other operations that modify these parameter variables themselves (no statements like c = ..., url = ..., ++url, url += n, or taking their address and writing through that). The code only: - reads 'url' (passed to strcmp) which does not modify the pointer or the pointed-to data (strcmp takes const char *). - passes 'c' to functions (MHD_queue_response, reply_with_page_not_found), which may modify the object pointed to (allowed by the rule) but do not modify the parameter variable inside this function. - uses a disabled (#if 0) block that is not compiled. There are also no casts removing const, nor any usage that would make the pointer itself an lvalue for modification. Therefore no fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
