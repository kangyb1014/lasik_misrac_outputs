  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The loop condition (i < quoted_len && j < unquoted_len) guarantees quoted[i] and unquoted[j] are in bounds at entry, and when a backslash is seen the code increments i and immediately checks if i == quoted_len and returns if so, preventing an out-of-bounds access. Also, this code does not call any <string.h> functions (so MISRA Rule 21.17, which targets those functions, is not applicable). A specific violation scenario would be if the check 'if (quoted_len == i) return false;' were removed (or the loop condition changed), allowing quoted[i] to be accessed when i == quoted_len."
