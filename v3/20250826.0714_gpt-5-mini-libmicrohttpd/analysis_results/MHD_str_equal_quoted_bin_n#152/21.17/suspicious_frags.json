  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions appear in this function, so there are no direct uses of the Standard Library string routines covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The remaining code fragments not listed above do not perform direct indexed accesses into the caller-provided buffers and therefore do not present the kind of potential out-of-bounds access covered by the rule: variable declarations and initializations are inert; the initial length-check (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2) does not dereference pointers; the final length-equality check and the return statements do not index the buffers; and comments produce no code. The listed fragments are the only places where the function indexes the caller-supplied arrays and/or modifies the index variables inside the loop, so they should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds indexing or off-by-one behavior."
