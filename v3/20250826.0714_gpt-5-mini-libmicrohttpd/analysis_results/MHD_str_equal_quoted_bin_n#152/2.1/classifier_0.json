  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is reachable \u2014 e.g. quoted = \"a\", quoted_len = 1, unquoted = \"\", unquoted_len = 0. The initial check (unquoted_len < quoted_len/2) is false (0 < 0 is false), the for loop body is not entered (unquoted_len > j is false), leaving i == 0 and j == 0. The subsequent if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j)) evaluates (1 != 0) true and returns false. Thus the code fragment can be executed and is not unreachable."
