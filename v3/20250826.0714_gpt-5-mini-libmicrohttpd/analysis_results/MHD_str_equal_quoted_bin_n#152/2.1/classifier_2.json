  "scenario": "The fragment is reachable. Two execution paths reach that comparison: (1) when quoted[i] is not a backslash, the code falls through directly to the comparison; (2) when quoted[i] is a backslash and it is not the last character (i+1 < quoted_len), the code increments i and then executes the comparison on the escaped character. Example: quoted = \"a\", quoted_len=1, unquoted = \"a\", unquoted_len=1 reaches the comparison (no backslash). Example with escape: quoted = \"\\\\n\" (two chars: backslash then 'n'), quoted_len=2, unquoted = \"n\", unquoted_len=1 \u2014 the backslash branch increments i to 1 and the comparison quoted[1] != unquoted[0] is executed. The code guards the out-of-bounds case by returning when the backslash is the final character, so the comparison is not unreachable. Therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated."
