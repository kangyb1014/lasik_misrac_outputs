  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect recursion). The function body contains no function calls at all (no call to MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n, no other named functions, and no function-call-like macros). There are no function-pointer dereferences or callback invocations that could cause indirect recursion. The control flow uses only local variables, a for loop, and conditional returns; none of these introduce recursion. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that could violate Rule 17.2."
