  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are statically unreachable (i.e., cannot be executed under any possible runtime conditions). Reasons: \n\n- The early returns (e.g. \"if (0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) return MHD_NO;\") are conditional and reachable for some inputs (non-GET methods). They do not create permanently unreachable code.\n- The \u2018\u2018first-call\u2019\u2019 branch (if (&aptr != *req_cls) { *req_cls = &aptr; return MHD_YES; }) is conditional on the value of *req_cls. Its body is intended to execute on the first invocation and the rest of the function on later invocations; both paths are reachable in normal usage of the callback.\n- All fopen/fstat/fileno/result-check branches are conditional on runtime I/O and file-system state (file exists, fileno failure, fstat success, regular file). Any of those branches may be reached depending on the environment and inputs.\n- The response-creation branches (NULL == file -> create static PAGE response; else create response from callback) are mutually exclusive but both reachable depending on fopen results. The inner check (if (NULL == response) { fclose(file); return MHD_NO; }) is also conditional on the response creation routine and therefore not guaranteed unreachable.\n- The (void) casts for unused parameters are executed to suppress compiler warnings and are not unreachable.\n\nBecause there are no constant-true/false conditions, no dead labels, no code after an unconditional always-taken return, and no constructs that are impossible to reach in any runtime scenario, I conclude there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this function."
