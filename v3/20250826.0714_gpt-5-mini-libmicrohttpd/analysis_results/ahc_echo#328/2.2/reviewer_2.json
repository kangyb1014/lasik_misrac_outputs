  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) upload_data; (and the similar casts for other unused parameters) are the conventional idiom to \u201cuse\u201d a formal parameter so as to suppress unused\u2011parameter diagnostics and to document the intent. Although removing that statement would not change the runtime behaviour of the function, it would change compile\u2011time diagnostics and the intent expressed in the source. MISRA\u2019s prohibition of dead code is aimed at unnecessary runtime operations; the intentional void\u2011cast is an accepted way to mark an unused parameter and is not considered dead code in practice. Therefore the claim that this line violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
