  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The cast-to-void statements like (void)upload_data_size; are deliberate uses to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s observable behaviour; the intent of the rule is to eliminate redundant or truly dead code (unneeded computations, unreachable-but-executable branches, etc.), not to forbid idioms that document intent or control diagnostics.\n\nRemoving the (void) line would not change runtime behaviour, but it would only affect compiler warnings/diagnostics; Rule 2.2 is concerned with program behaviour, not diagnostics. In addition, using the parameter in this way is a conventional, well-understood pattern for unused parameters. If desired, other approaches (omitting the parameter name in the function definition where allowed, or using a compiler-specific attribute) can be used to silence warnings, but the presence of the (void) cast here should not be reported as a violation of MISRA 2.2."
