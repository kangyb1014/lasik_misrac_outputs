  "explanation": "There are no direct calls to ahc_echo in the function body, so no obvious direct recursion. Most standard library calls present (fopen, fileno, fstat, fclose, strlen) and the simple response creation/destruction call MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static / MHD_destroy_response are not expected to invoke the request handler and therefore are not suspicious for indirect recursion. The fragments selected are those that can cause indirect invocation of the request handler: the req_cls handshake (setting *req_cls and returning MHD_YES) causes the server to invoke the callback again and therefore could be part of a re-entry or indirect call chain; passing function pointers (&file_reader, &free_callback) into MHD_create_response_from_callback hands control to callbacks that might call back into ahc_echo; and calling MHD_queue_response may (depending on the library implementation and configuration) cause synchronous or asynchronous invocations of the request handler. These are the only locations in the function that could reasonably produce indirect or re-entrant calls to ahc_echo and thus require investigation for compliance with MISRA C Rule 17.2. Other lines do not perform or pass callbacks and thus need not be investigated for potential self-calls."
