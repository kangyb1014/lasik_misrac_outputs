  "explanation": "I selected all control-related fragments (the assertion and every if statement) because Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions. These are the only locations in the function that introduce control flow decisions. Other parts of the function do not contain controlling expressions or cannot be invariant in the sense of the rule: - Calls that supply the condition (find_auth_rq_header_, parse_bauth_params, allocation function) are runtime-dependent and therefore not inherently invariant. - Assignments, memset, memory allocation, logging (MHD_DLOG / HAVE_MESSAGES blocks), and return statements are not controlling expressions and so are outside the scope of Rule 14.3. - Macro expansions used for logging or localization (e.g., _(...)) do not create invariant controlling expressions in this context. Hence no other fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance."
