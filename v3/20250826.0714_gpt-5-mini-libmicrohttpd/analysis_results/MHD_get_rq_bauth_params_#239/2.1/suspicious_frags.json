  "explanation": "Other parts of this function do not exhibit obvious unreachable-code patterns and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the early-return on connection->rq.bauth_tried is a reachable guard; the call to find_auth_rq_header_ and its false branch (setting tried flag and returning) are valid, reachable error-handling paths; the allocation, NULL check, memset, parse_bauth_params success/failure branches and the final updates to connection->rq.bauth and connection->rq.bauth_tried are standard, reachable control flow. There are no infinite loops, constant-false/true conditional expressions (aside from the items listed), or statements following unconditional returns (other than normal function flow) elsewhere in the function. Therefore only the listed fragments warrant further investigation for potential unreachable code."
