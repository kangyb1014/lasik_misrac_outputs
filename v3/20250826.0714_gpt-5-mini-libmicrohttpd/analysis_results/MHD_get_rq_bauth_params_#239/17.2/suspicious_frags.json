  "explanation": "Only calls (including function-like macros) can produce direct or indirect recursion. The fragments listed are every function or function-like macro invocation present in the function body and thus should be investigated for potential direct/indirect calls back to MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_. All other code in the function consists of local variable declarations, structure field accesses, assignments, boolean checks, return statements and string literals; these cannot introduce (direct or indirect) function recursion by themselves and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2 compliance."
