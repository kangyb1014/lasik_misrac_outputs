  "explanation": "No occurrences of modifying the function parameter itself were found. The only function parameter is the pointer 'connection'. The code reads and writes members of the object pointed to by 'connection' (for example: connection->rq.bauth_tried = true; connection->rq.bauth = NULL; connection->rq.bauth = bauth; uses connection->state; passes connection to helper functions). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8; the rule prohibits modifying the pointer parameter variable itself (e.g., reassigning connection, incrementing/decrementing it, or storing its address elsewhere). There are no statements reassigning 'connection' (no \"connection = ...\"), no pointer arithmetic on 'connection', and no other parameters present. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
