  "explanation": "I marked assertions (mhd_assert calls) and several branches that manipulate the separator \", \" and the pw adjustment as suspicious. Assertions are frequently compiled out or turned into no-ops in non-debug builds and therefore their presence/absence can make them candidates for dead code analysis. The repeated separator-insertion blocks (including the 'else pw += 2' branch) appear in multiple places and contain branches that may be redundant in some execution paths; these operations are executed but could be no-ops in certain cases, so they warrant inspection to determine if removal would change behavior. The memmove guarded by (pr != pw) is another candidate because when pr == pw it does nothing; its presence should be checked to ensure it is not unnecessary in all reachable cases.\n\nI did not mark the main token-parsing loops, the equality checks (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_), the length checks and updates (e.g. \"*str_len = pw\"), the pr/pw read-and-copy loop body (other than the memmove case), the early \"continue\" after the equal-length check, the pr += tkn_len + 2 advances, or the return of token_removed because these operations affect program state or control flow in ways that are necessary for correct behavior: they control token scanning, matching, skipping, copying and final length update. Removing those would clearly change function behaviour, so they are not flagged as potential dead code."
