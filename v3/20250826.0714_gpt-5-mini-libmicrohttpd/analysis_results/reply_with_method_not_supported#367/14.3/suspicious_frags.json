  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in loop constructs (for, while, do-while). The provided function contains no loop constructs \u2014 no for, while, or do-while \u2014 so there are no controlling expressions to be invariant and thus nothing that triggers Rule 14.3 in this snippet. The only conditional is \"if (NULL == resp)\", which depends on the runtime return value of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static and is not an invariant. The static const initializers are constant data, not loop controls. Calls to MHD_* functions could internally contain loops, but those internal implementations are outside the scope of this function source and are not visible here; the rule applies to controlling expressions in the code fragments provided, and none are present."
