  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. Specific notes:\n\n- The page_content array is defined as a static const char[] initialized from string literals (concatenated by the C compiler). No string.h functions are invoked to build or manipulate it.\n- page_content_len is computed using sizeof(page_content) / sizeof(char) - 1. This correctly yields the length of the content excluding the terminating NUL and does not invoke any string library routines (so it cannot cause out-of-bounds string.h accesses).\n- The calls to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response are calls into the libmicrohttpd API; the code here passes a pointer and an explicit length (for the response creation) or string literals for headers. There are no local uses of the string functions listed by the rule.\n\nIf further investigation is required, it would be limited to the implementations of the external MHD_* functions (not part of this translation unit) to ensure they themselves do not call <string.h> functions in a way that accesses beyond the bounds of the provided buffers. However, within the shown code fragment there are no suspicious uses triggering Rule 21.17."
