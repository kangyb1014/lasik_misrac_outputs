  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls MHD_destroy_response(resp), which is a different function than reply_with_method_not_supported and does not demonstrate a direct or indirect call back to itself. Only if the implementation of MHD_destroy_response (or functions it invokes) were to call reply_with_method_not_supported would an indirect recursion occur, but there is no evidence of that in the provided code fragment."
