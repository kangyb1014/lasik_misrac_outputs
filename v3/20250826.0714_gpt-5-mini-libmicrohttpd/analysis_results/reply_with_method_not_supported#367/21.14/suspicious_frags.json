  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code. The code only declares a string literal (page_content), computes its length using sizeof (not by comparing strings), and calls MHD_* library functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). There are no string comparisons or any calls to memcmp that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14, so no fragments require further investigation for this rule."
