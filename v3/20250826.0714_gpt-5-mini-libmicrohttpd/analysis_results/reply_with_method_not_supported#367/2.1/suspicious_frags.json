  "explanation": "The main suspicious fragment is the entire static function definition. Because it has internal linkage (static), it may be unused in the project and thus constitute unreachable (dead) code; whether it is actually unreachable cannot be determined from this single translation unit alone and should be investigated globally (call graph / symbol usage). No other distinct unreachable-code patterns are present inside the function: there are no statements after unconditional return, no code guarded by constant-false conditions, and all branches (the NULL check and the normal path) are reachable in some execution path. The static data initializers are compile-time constants and are reachable if the function is called. Therefore no other fragments in this function appear to be unreachable and do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1 beyond confirming whether the static function is referenced elsewhere in the project."
