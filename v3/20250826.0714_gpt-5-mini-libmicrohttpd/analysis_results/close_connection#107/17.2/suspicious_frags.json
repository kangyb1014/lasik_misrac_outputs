  "explanation": "I have included all function or macro-like calls present in close_connection that could possibly lead (directly or indirectly) back to close_connection and therefore warrant investigation for Rule 17.2. I did not include the following fragments because they cannot on their own introduce recursion back to close_connection:\n\n- The function signature and local variable declaration (static void close_connection (struct MHD_Connection *pos) { struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = pos->daemon;): these are definitions/declarations and do not perform calls.\n- Preprocessor conditionals and comments (#ifdef / #endif / /* ... */): these control compilation and are not function calls themselves.\n- Simple control-flow constructs and operators (if (pos->connection_timeout_ms == daemon->connection_timeout_ms) ... else ... , return; when it simply returns without calling another function): these do not invoke other functions except where a function call is explicitly present (those calls are listed in suspicious_frags).\n- Direct field accesses and assignments (e.g., daemon->data_already_pending = true;, mhd_assert checks that evaluate boolean expressions): field reads/writes alone cannot cause a call to close_connection (unless a macro expands to a function call, in which case that macro usage has been included among the suspicious fragments).\n\nIf additional source (definitions of the called functions/macros listed above) is provided, investigators should inspect those functions (MHD_connection_close_, MHD_connection_mark_closed_, XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, MHD_mutex_* helpers, MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_, and the MHD_D_IS_USING_* macros) to determine whether any of them call close_connection directly or indirectly. The fragments I listed are the call sites inside close_connection that could participate in recursive invocation and therefore need to be examined."
