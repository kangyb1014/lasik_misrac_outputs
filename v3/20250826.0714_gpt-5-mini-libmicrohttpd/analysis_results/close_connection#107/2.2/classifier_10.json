  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of close_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\nclose_connection (struct MHD_Connection *pos)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = pos->daemon;\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The unlocked call is compiled only when thread support macros are set and pairs with the earlier MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ guarded by the same condition; removing it would change runtime behaviour (leave the mutex locked and cause deadlock/incorrect concurrency). (Hypothetical violation scenario: if MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ is defined as an empty no-op in the build where the #if condition is true, then the call would be a no-op and could be considered dead code \u2014 but that would be an issue in the API implementation rather than this fragment.)"
