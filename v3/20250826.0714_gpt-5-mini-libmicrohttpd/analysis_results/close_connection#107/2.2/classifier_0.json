  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of close_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\nclose_connection (struct MHD_Connection *pos)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = pos->daemon;\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "From the single function fragment there is no evidence that removing the assignment would not affect program behaviour. Most likely this assignment sets a flag consumed elsewhere (e.g. by a cleanup thread) and is therefore not dead. However, a violation would occur if the member daemon->data_already_pending is never read (or is always overwritten before any read) anywhere in the project \u2014 in that case the assignment is dead and Rule 2.2 would be violated."
