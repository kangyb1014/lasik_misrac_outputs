  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided close_connection function. The function contains assertions, mutex lock/unlock calls, calls to MHD_connection_close_, and list-manipulation macros/functions (XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert). None of those calls in this fragment directly invoke the standard string-handling APIs targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for out-of-bounds accesses caused by <string.h> functions.\n\nNote: If any of the called functions or macros (MHD_connection_close_, XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, DLL_insert, or any macros expanded here) are defined elsewhere and internally use <string.h> functions in a way that could access memory out-of-bounds, those definitions should be inspected. However, those implementations are not present in the supplied code fragment and so are outside the scope of this review of this function body."
