In typical configurations mhd_assert(0) is non\u2011returning (terminates the program), so the assignment has no observable effect \u2014 removing it would not change behaviour.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. You cannot conclude that the assignment da->ready_for_hashing = false; is dead code across the project merely because in a \u201ctypical\u201d configuration mhd_assert(0) aborts. MISRA Rule 2.2 requires that an executed operation be removable without changing program behaviour for it to be dead code. Whether the assertion is non\u2011returning is not guaranteed by the source shown \u2014 mhd_assert may be implemented differently (e.g. log and continue, call a hook, or be conditionally compiled) and build/configuration differences (assertions enabled/disabled, _DEBUG defined/not defined) mean removal could change behaviour in some project configurations. Also a static analyser or the standard cannot assume mhd_assert is non\u2011returning unless it is explicitly annotated or defined so in the project. Therefore the assignment cannot be labelled dead code on the evidence given and the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is not justified."
