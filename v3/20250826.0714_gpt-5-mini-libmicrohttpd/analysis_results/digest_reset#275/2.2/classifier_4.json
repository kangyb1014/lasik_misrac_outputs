  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of digest_reset:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ndigest_reset (struct DigestAlgorithm *da)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->uninitialised);\n  mhd_assert (da->algo_selected);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo)\n  {\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_HAS_FINISH\n    mhd_assert (! da->ready_for_hashing);\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No definite violation can be determined from this fragment alone. The shown code is not obviously dead: the reset function calls (MHD_MD5_reset) and the conditional checks are meaningful when compiled in. However there are potential situations that would produce dead code here. For example, if _DEBUG is defined and the only effect of the fragment is to set da->ready_for_hashing = true but that member is never subsequently read anywhere in the project, then that assignment would be executed yet removable without changing program behaviour (dead code). Similarly, if mhd_assert expands to a no-op in the build where it is present, those assert statements are not executed; conversely, if they are executed but have no effect on observable program behaviour, they could be considered dead. From the fragment alone one cannot prove a Rule 2.2 violation, but the specific violation scenario is: the _DEBUG-only assignment to da->ready_for_hashing is executed and never used elsewhere in the project, making it dead code."
