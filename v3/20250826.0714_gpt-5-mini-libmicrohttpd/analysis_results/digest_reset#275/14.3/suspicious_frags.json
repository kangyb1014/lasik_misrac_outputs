  "explanation": "Only C-level controlling expressions (if/while/do-while/for conditions) are relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. The lines selected are the only C controlling expressions in the function and therefore should be investigated for potential invariance. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3 for these reasons:\n- Preprocessor directives (#ifdef / #endif) are not C controlling expressions and are outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\n- mhd_assert(...) invocations are assertion macros/expressions, not C control statements; they do not constitute controlling expressions for the rule.\n- The assignments inside the #ifdef _DEBUG blocks are simple assignments, not controlling expressions.\n- The final else block and its contents are not a controlling expression themselves (they are the consequence of the chained if/else structure already covered by the listed if conditions).\nNo loops (except conditional if statements) or do-while constructs are present that would otherwise need checking for the allowed exceptions."
