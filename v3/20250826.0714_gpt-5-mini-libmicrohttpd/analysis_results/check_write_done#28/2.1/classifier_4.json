  "scenario": "The fragment /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */ is a C comment (commented-out text), not actual code. Comments are not compiled or part of the executable, so they cannot be \u201cunreachable code.\u201d Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If that expression were active and made a branch permanently unreachable (e.g. an always-true/false condition), that would be a different violation scenario."
