  "scenario": "The if condition only tests (connection->write_buffer_append_offset != connection->write_buffer_send_offset). The alternative expression is inside a comment and thus not part of the code. At runtime either branch may be taken (return MHD_NO if the inequality is true; otherwise the subsequent assignments and return MHD_YES execute), so no statements are syntactically or semantically unreachable. The commented-out expression does not create unreachable code."
