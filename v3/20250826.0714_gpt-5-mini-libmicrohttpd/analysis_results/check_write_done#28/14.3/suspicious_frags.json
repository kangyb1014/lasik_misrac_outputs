  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The only controlling expression in the function is the if condition:\n\n  (connection->write_buffer_append_offset != connection->write_buffer_send_offset) /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true */\n\nThis expression depends on structure members (connection->write_buffer_append_offset and connection->write_buffer_send_offset) and is therefore not a compile-time or invariant expression. The commented-out portion (data_in_tls_buffers == true) is not active code and so cannot cause an invariant controlling expression in the presented source. There are no loops in this function whose controlling expressions would need checking. The remaining statements (resets of offsets, assignment to connection->state, and return statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3."
