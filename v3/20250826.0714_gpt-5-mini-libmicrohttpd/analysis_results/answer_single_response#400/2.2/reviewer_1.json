As such it qualifies as dead code under Rule 2.2 and violates the rule. A corrective action is to remove the unused parameter name, use a compiler-specific 'unused' attribute, or otherwise avoid emitting the no-op cast.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is not correct. Rule 2.2 prohibits truly dead code \u2014 executable operations whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s behaviour. The statement \u201c(void) cls;\u201d is the conventional idiom to form an explicit use of an otherwise unused parameter. It is not an accidental redundant operation but an intentional reference to suppress diagnostics and to document that the parameter is intentionally unused. MISRA\u2019s concern with dead code is to eliminate redundant, unnecessary executable fragments; an explicit cast-to-void to \u201cuse\u201d a parameter is a recognized, purposeful pattern and is not normally treated as a violation of Rule 2.2. If a project policy prefers not to use that idiom, other options (remove the parameter name in the prototype, use a compiler attribute, or adjust the function signature) are available, but the presence of \u201c(void) cls;\u201d by itself does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation."
