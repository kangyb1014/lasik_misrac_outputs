  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the supplied function. The only string comparison is via strcmp ((0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && (0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD))), which compares null-terminated strings and is not the MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 violation (the rule forbids memcmp for null-terminated strings). No other calls or macros in this function invoke memcmp or perform raw-memory comparisons that would need investigation. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require further review for Rule 21.14."
