  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Specific reasons:\n- if (NULL == *req_cls) \u2014 depends on the runtime value pointed to by req_cls; not a constant.\n- if ((0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && (0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD))) \u2014 depends on runtime strcmp results and the method argument; not invariant.\n- There are no loops (for, while, do-while) whose controlling expressions could be constant/invariant.\n- The static initialization (static int marker = 0) is not a controlling expression; assigning &marker to *req_cls does not create an invariant controlling expression.\n- The (void) casts are not control-flow expressions.\n\nTherefore no fragments in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant), and no additional fragments need investigation for this specific rule."
