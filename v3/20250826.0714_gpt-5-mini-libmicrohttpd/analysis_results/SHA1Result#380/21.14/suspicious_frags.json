  "explanation": "I inspected the provided SHA1Result function for uses of the standard library function memcmp or any other code that compares null-terminated strings with memcmp. The function contains: pointer NULL checks, boolean/flag checks, calls to SHA1PadMessage (not shown), loops that zero a message block, integer/bitwise operations to build the digest, and assignments into the Message_Digest array. There are no calls to memcmp (or other string-comparison library functions) and no comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
