  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically checked and ruled out: use of __attribute__, __asm__ / asm, inline as a compiler-specific keyword, long long or other non-standard integer types, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, computed-goto (goto *expr), designated initializer extensions, flexible array members or variable-length arrays (the parameter Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize] is a normal function parameter declaration and decays to a pointer per the C standard), and any compiler-specific pragmas. All constructs in the snippet (enum return type, pointer and array parameter notation, bitwise shifts and arithmetic, for-loops, casts, hex constants) are standard C and not compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
