  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are clearly unreachable. Reasoning:\n- The function contains only conditional returns (on context or Message_Digest being NULL, and on context->corrupted). These are not unconditional returns that make subsequent statements unreachable in all cases; they are proper guards whose negations allow later code to execute.\n- The block guarded by if (! context->computed) is reachable whenever context is non-NULL, not corrupted, and computed is false; there is no constant condition that would make it unreachable.\n- The final for-loop and return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS are reachable when the function does not hit one of the earlier conditional returns.\n- There are no goto labels, no code appearing after an unconditional return within the same function scope, no switch cases falling through to dead code, and no compile-time constant conditions that would render branches permanently unreachable.\n- The array parameter Message_Digest decays to a pointer in the function signature, so the NULL check is meaningful; hence the code path that follows that check is reachable.\nGiven the snippet alone, there is no evident unreachable code to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If additional project-wide invariants (for example, guarantees that context can never be NULL or that context->computed is always true) exist, those could make some branches unreachable \u2014 such project-level information would need to be inspected to decide further."
