  "explanation": "No direct call to SHA1Result appears elsewhere in the function body, and there are no other function calls in this code fragment besides SHA1PadMessage(context). Field accesses, loops, assignments and the return statements cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion themselves. There are no function pointer invocations or callbacks in the shown code that could hide a recursive call. Therefore the only fragment that could cause indirect recursion (and must be investigated further) is the call to SHA1PadMessage; the function signature is also reported so investigators can trace possible calls back to this function. All other lines (null checks, context->computed test, zeroing the message block, copying intermediate_hash into Message_Digest, and the return statements) do not call functions and thus do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
