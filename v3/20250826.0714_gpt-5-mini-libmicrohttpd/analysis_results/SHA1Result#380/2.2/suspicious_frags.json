Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains checks and operations that are not candidates for dead code: the null-pointer guard (if (! context || ! Message_Digest) return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;) is necessary to avoid dereferencing invalid pointers; the corrupted-state check (if (context->corrupted) return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;) affects control flow and error reporting; the final loop that writes Message_Digest from context->intermediate_hash is the primary observable output of the function and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the function return (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS) is required. The local declaration of i and the loop indices are normal bookkeeping and not dead code. Therefore those fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
