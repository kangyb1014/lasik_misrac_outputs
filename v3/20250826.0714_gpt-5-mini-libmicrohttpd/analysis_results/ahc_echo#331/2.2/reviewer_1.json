  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is not correct. The lines such as \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d are the common idiom to explicitly mark a parameter as unused and to silence compiler warnings. Although the expression has no side effects, MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids removal only when that removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 and the rule explicitly points out that timing can be part of behaviour. More importantly, this construct is an explicit annotation of intent (to keep the API and indicate the parameter is unused) rather than accidental dead operations. In practice MISRA analyses treat this idiom as acceptable for unused parameters (and other MISRA rules/guidance address unused parameters specifically). Thus flagging that cast-to-void as a Rule 2.2 violation is a false positive."
