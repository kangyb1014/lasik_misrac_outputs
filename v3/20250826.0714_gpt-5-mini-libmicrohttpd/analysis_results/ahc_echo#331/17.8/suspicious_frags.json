  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter itself (reassigning the pointer parameter). In this function there are no assignments that reassign parameter variables (e.g. there is no code like \"req_cls = ...\" or \"connection = ...\"). The listed fragments are the only places where pointer-parameter-related objects are accessed/modified and therefore warrant inspection: \"req = *req_cls;\" reads the object pointed to by the parameter, \"*req_cls = req;\" writes the object referred to by the pointer parameter (writing through a pointer is allowed by the rule but should be reviewed for intent), and \"req->connection = connection;\" stores the parameter value into a structure field (this uses the pointer value but does not reassign the parameter itself). Other lines in the function are either casts to void to silence warnings, function calls that pass parameters (no reassignment of the parameter variables), local variable assignments, or use of library calls; none reassign the pointer parameters themselves and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.8."
