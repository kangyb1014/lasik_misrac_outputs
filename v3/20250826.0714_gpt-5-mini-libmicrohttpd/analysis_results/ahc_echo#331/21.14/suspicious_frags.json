  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function and found no calls to memcmp (nor to alternatives like bcmp) that would compare null-terminated strings. The only string operation is strlen(url) to obtain the URL length for creating a response buffer; that does not use memcmp and is appropriate for determining a null-terminated string length. There are no string-comparison calls (e.g., strcmp) or macros/function pointers in this snippet that hide memcmp usage. Other fragments (timerfd, epoll, MHD APIs, malloc, strerror/printf) are unrelated to Rule 21.14 and therefore do not need investigation for the memcmp restriction."
