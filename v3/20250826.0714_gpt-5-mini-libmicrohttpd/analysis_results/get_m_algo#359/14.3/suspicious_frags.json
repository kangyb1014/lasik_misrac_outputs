  "explanation": "Only the three if / else-if controlling expressions in this function are control statements that could be invariant. The rest of the function contains return statements, a comment, and the function header, none of which are controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other conditionals in this snippet that could violate the rule, so no other fragments require investigation."
