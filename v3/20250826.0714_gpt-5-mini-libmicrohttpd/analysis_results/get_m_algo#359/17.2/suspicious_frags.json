  "explanation": "The function get_m_algo contains no function calls at all\u2014neither calls to itself nor to any other function. It just evaluates three boolean flags (force_md5, force_sha256, force_sha512_256) and returns one of several enum constants. There is no use of function pointers, no macro invocations that appear as function calls in this fragment, and no indirect call sites. Therefore there is no direct or indirect recursion to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
