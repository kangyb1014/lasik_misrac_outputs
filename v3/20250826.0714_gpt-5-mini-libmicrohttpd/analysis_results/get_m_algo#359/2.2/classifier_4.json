  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_m_algo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3\nget_m_algo (void)\n{\n  if (force_md5)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5;\n  else if (force_sha256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256;\n  else if (force_sha512_256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256;\n\n  /* No forced algorithm selection, let MHD to use default */\n  return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The return provides the default algorithm when none of the force_* flags are true and is executed in normal operation. Removing it would change program behaviour (and likely introduce undefined behaviour because a non-void function could fall off the end), so it is not dead code. (If a separate proof showed this branch is provably unreachable, that would be unreachable code, not dead code, per the rule notes.)"
