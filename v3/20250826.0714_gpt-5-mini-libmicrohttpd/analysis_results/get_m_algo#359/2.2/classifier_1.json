Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_m_algo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3\nget_m_algo (void)\n{\n  if (force_md5)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5;\n  else if (force_sha256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256;\n  else if (force_sha512_256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256;\n\n  /* No forced algorithm selection, let MHD to use default */\n  return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3\nget_m_algo (void)\n{\n  if (force_md5)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5;\n  else if (force_sha256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256;\n  else if (force_sha512_256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256;\n\n  /* No forced algorithm selection, let MHD to use default */\n  return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The function selects and returns one of several enum values based on the force_* flags; each return is meaningful and affects caller behaviour (so in isolation it is not dead code). A possible violation scenario would be if all call sites ignore the return value of get_m_algo() (i.e. the returned enum is never used) \u2014 then calls and the work done by this function would be dead code, violating Rule 2.2. Another possible violation would be if, due to build configuration or macros, two or more of the returned enum constants are identical and the distinct branches therefore have no observable effect; in that case a branch could be dead code."
