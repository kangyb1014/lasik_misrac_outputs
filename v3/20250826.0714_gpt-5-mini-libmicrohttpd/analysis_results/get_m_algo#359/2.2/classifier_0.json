  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_m_algo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3\nget_m_algo (void)\n{\n  if (force_md5)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5;\n  else if (force_sha256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256;\n  else if (force_sha512_256)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256;\n\n  /* No forced algorithm selection, let MHD to use default */\n  return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (force_md5)\n    return MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the if-return is an active decision point \u2014 when force_md5 is true the function returns a different enum value, so removing it would change behaviour. This fragment is not dead code as presented. It would become a Rule 2.2 violation only if there is external evidence that the condition can never be true (e.g. force_md5 is a compile-time constant false or is never set/always cleared and thus the branch can never execute), in which case the return would be an operation that is executed never and could be removed without effect."
