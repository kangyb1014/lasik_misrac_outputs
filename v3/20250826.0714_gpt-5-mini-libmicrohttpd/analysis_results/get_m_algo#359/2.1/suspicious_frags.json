  "explanation": "Unreachable-code risk in this function hinges on the compile-time or run-time values of the force_* identifiers. If any of force_md5, force_sha256, or force_sha512_256 are (effectively) constant true at compile time (e.g. #defined or constant-initialized) or if program logic guarantees one branch is always taken, subsequent branches or the final return may be unreachable. The fragments flagged are the conditional branches and the final return because each return can make following code unreachable; these should be inspected to determine whether any of the conditions are constant or guaranteed and thus create unreachable code.\n\nOther pieces of the function (the function signature, braces, and the else keywords by themselves) are not separately reported because they are not independent executable statements that could be unreachable\u2014their behavior is encompassed by the conditional/return fragments listed above. No other executable statements exist in the function to inspect for Rule 2.1."
