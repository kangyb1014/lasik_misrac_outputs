  "explanation": "Pointers that should be examined for possible const-qualification are places where a buffer is passed to a function that only reads from it (the callee's parameter could/should be const). The two fragments above pass userhash_bin to other functions: the call to MHD_bin_to_hex_z is the primary candidate because that function likely only reads the binary hash and therefore its corresponding parameter should be reviewed to ensure it is declared as pointing to a const-qualified type. The call to MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash is included for completeness so the callee signature can be checked (it is expected to write into the buffer \u2014 if it does not, its parameter should be const). Other code in the function does not require investigation for Rule 8.13: username and realm are already const-qualified; function parameters algo3 and hex_buf_size are non-pointer types; userhash_hex is clearly an output buffer (it is written to) so it must be non-const; the size check and return statements do not involve pointer const-qualification issues."
