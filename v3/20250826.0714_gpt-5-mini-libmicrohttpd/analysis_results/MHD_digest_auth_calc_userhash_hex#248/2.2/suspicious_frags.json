  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments detected. Each statement in the function has an observable effect on program behaviour or is necessary for safety/contract compliance:\n\n- The declaration uint8_t userhash_bin[MAX_DIGEST]; is used to receive the binary hash from MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash and then to produce the hex string; removing it would change behaviour.\n- digest_size is assigned from digest_get_hash_size(algo3) and is used both to check the hex buffer size and as the length argument to MHD_bin_to_hex_z; the assignment and subsequent uses are relevant.\n- The buffer-size check (if (digest_size * 2 + 1 > hex_buf_size) return MHD_NO;) affects program flow and prevents overflow; removing it would alter behaviour and safety.\n- The call to MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash(...) is checked for failure and returns MHD_NO on failure; both the call and its result test affect behaviour.\n- The call to MHD_bin_to_hex_z(...) converts the computed binary hash into the output hex string; it produces the observable output written to userhash_hex.\n- The returned values (MHD_NO / MHD_YES) are the function\u2019s observable results.\n\nThere is no unreachable code in this function, and initializations/assignments here are not merely redundant initializations (MISRA note: initialization is not the same as an assignment and is not dead code). Therefore, no fragment in this function appears to be dead code that could be removed without affecting behaviour."
