It performs no observable action and removing it would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (The same applies to the other '(void) <param>;' lines in the function.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) param; statements are the common idiom to indicate and intentionally suppress unused-parameter warnings; they are present to document intent and to influence diagnostics, not to perform some mistakenly redundant runtime action. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets true dead code whose removal would not affect the program\u2019s observable behaviour. While removing these no-op casts does not change the program\u2019s runtime functional behaviour, they are not accidental redundant computations: they convey intent and affect toolchain diagnostics (compiler warnings) and maintainability. In practice, this idiom is accepted as the correct way to mark unused parameters; if a project prefers stricter handling, use a dedicated UNUSED_PARAM macro or an appropriate compiler attribute. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not justified."
