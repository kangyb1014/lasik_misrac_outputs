  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void statements such as '(void) url;' are the common idiom to explicitly mark function parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. They are no\u2011ops and generate no observable behaviour, but they are intentional annotations rather than inadvertent, leftover code. Under a strict literal reading of the Rule 2.2 definition one could argue they are operations whose removal would not change program behaviour; however MISRA practice treats the (void)parameter idiom as an accepted way to document/suppress unused parameters (and such statements do not indicate a design fault or unintended dead code). In short, this is an intentional no\u2011op used for documentation/diagnostic control and is not a violation to be reported as dead code. If a particular tool flags these, the proper response is justification or suppression, not treating them as rule\u20112.2 defects."
