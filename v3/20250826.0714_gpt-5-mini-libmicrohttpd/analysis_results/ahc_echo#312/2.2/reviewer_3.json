  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statements like (void)version; (and the other (void) param casts in that function) are the common idiom to document an intentionally unused parameter and to suppress compiler \"unused parameter\" diagnostics. They have no side effects and typically compile to no code, and MISRA guidance accepts such explicit annotations to indicate intent (or at least does not treat these harmless casts as the kind of dead code the rule is intended to forbid). Rule 2.2 targets genuinely redundant operations that should be removed because they affect maintainability or could mask logic errors; a deliberate (void)cast to mark an unused parameter is an allowed/accepted practice for that purpose. If you prefer to avoid the casts you can instead omit parameter names where permitted or use a compiler-specific unused attribute, but the presence of (void)version; here does not constitute a MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 violation."
