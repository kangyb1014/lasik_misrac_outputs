  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- No GCC/Clang-specific keywords or constructs are present (no __attribute__, __extension__, __typeof__, __asm__, statement-expressions, nested functions, or labels-as-values).\n- No vendor-specific pragmas or inline-asm appear.\n- The (void)parameter idiom is standard C to silence unused-parameter warnings, not an extension.\n- The function signature and return statements use standard C constructs only.\n\nNote: references to external identifiers (MHD_Result, MHD_queue_response, MHD_HTTP_OK, response) are unresolved in this snippet, but their use here does not itself constitute a compiler language extension. If those identifiers are defined elsewhere using compiler-specific extensions, that would need to be checked in their definitions, which are not part of this fragment."
