  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the string parameters (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) are already const-qualified; the (void) casts are just to mark unused parameters and are not pointer type violations; the use of strcmp(method, \"GET\") operates on an already const-qualified pointer; there are no other pointer declarations or uses in the snippet that could be made to point to const. The call to MHD_queue_response and the identifier response are outside the scope of pointer qualification checks in the shown code fragment."
