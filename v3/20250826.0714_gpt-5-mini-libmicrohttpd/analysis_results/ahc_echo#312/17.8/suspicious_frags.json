  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code fragment. Each parameter is either cast to void to indicate it is unused (these casts do not change the parameter value), or is passed/read-only to functions (e.g. method is passed to strcmp; connection is passed to MHD_queue_response). There are no assignments to any parameter variables (no statements like p = ... or *p = ... that modify the pointer parameter itself). Pointer parameters are not reassigned, nor are their addresses stored or changed. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided snippet."
