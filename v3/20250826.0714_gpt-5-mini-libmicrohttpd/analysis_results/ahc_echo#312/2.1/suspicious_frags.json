  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Rationale:\n\n- The function contains two distinct return paths that are both reachable depending on the runtime result of strcmp(method, \"GET\"): the 'return MHD_NO;' executes when the method is not \"GET\", and the 'return MHD_queue_response(...)' executes when the method equals \"GET\". Both returns are syntactically reachable and there is no code following either return that would be dead/unreachable.\n- The (void) casts for cls, url, version, upload_data, upload_data_size, and req_cls are executed statements (used to suppress unused-parameter warnings), not dead code \u2014 they are not unreachable and therefore not violations of Rule 2.1.\n- There are no conditional compilation directives, goto jumps, infinite loops, or other control-flow constructs in the snippet that would create unreachable code regions.\n- Although the identifier 'response' used in the second return is not declared within the snippet, that is a potential correctness/compilation issue but not evidence of unreachable code; it does not imply a Rule 2.1 violation in this fragment.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
