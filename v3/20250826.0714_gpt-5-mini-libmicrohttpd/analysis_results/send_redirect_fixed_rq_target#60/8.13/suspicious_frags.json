  "explanation": "Pointers that are only used for reading or passed to functions that do not modify the pointed-to data should be examined for possible const qualification. The fragments above involve pointer variables and pointer arguments (b, hdr_name, use of MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION, and their allocation/usage) that could be candidates for const qualification or may reveal mismatches in function parameter constness (e.g. transmit_error_response_header). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the local variable 'const char chr' is already const-qualified; the code writes into buffer 'b' during URI encoding (so 'b' must be a modifiable char * while being written), and the index/length variables (i, o, fixed_uri_len, hdr_name_len) are non-pointer scalars not relevant to pointer const qualification. Assertions and most struct field accesses read or write state but do not introduce local pointers that could/should be const-qualified, so they are not flagged for this rule."
