The assertion has no side-effects and will never fail at run-time, so its execution cannot affect program behaviour; removing it would not change the program.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert() call cannot be assumed to be dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. An assertion is a runtime check that can change behaviour if its condition ever fails (e.g. by logging, triggering diagnostics or aborting). Even if, based on current parsing logic, the condition appears redundant in normal operation, that is an assumption about program state that need not hold in all configurations, in future changes, or in presence of unexpected inputs. Removing the assertion would remove this runtime diagnostic/safety behaviour in the exceptional case, so its removal could affect program behaviour. Also, mhd_assert is a macro that may expand to code with side-effects in some builds (or to nothing in others); that variability means you cannot treat the present call as dead code across the project. For these reasons the claimed violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
