  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in this function that are definitively unreachable (i.e., cannot be executed under any possible runtime/compile-time condition). Reasoning by control flow and conditionals:\n\n- The initial if that calls connection_close_error() and returns is conditional on buffer/size/malloc checks. That branch is reachable when the size limits or allocation fail, and the rest of the function is reachable when those checks pass \u2014 so no unreachable code there.\n\n- The do/while loop is reachable whenever the function proceeds past the initial allocation. The loop body is entered at least once by the do/while construct; if the asserted invariants (such as num_ws_in_uri > 0 and num_ws_in_uri <= req_target_len) hold then the loop executes the expected number of iterations. Even if assertions are compiled out, the loop is still reachable (though it might then expose other correctness issues), not unreachable.\n\n- The switch inside the loop contains explicit cases for several whitespace characters and a default case that handles all other character values. There are no case labels that are provably impossible in every execution (the mhd_assert checks only document expected properties but do not make code unreachable). Thus no unreachable case-blocks were found.\n\n- The hdr_name allocation branch (if (NULL != hdr_name) { ... return; } ) is reachable when malloc succeeds; the following free(b) and connection_close_error() are reachable when hdr_name allocation fails. Both branches are reachable depending on malloc outcome, so neither block is unreachable.\n\n- There is no code following an unconditional return that can never be reached; all returns are on code paths that are reachable depending on runtime conditions.\n\nNote: While I did not identify unreachable code fragments, there are places that rely on assertions for safety (e.g., assumptions about req_target_len and characters in rq_tgt). If assertions are compiled out, these could lead to undefined behavior (out-of-bounds reads/writes), but that is a correctness/robustness concern rather than unreachable code per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
