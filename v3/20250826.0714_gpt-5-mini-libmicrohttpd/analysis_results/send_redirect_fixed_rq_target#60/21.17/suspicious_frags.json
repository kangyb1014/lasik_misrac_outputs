  "explanation": "I flagged only the memcpy usage for investigation because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of Standard Library string-handling functions. This is the only direct use of a <string.h> function (memcpy) in the provided function. Other fragments in the function do not call any <string.h> functions (the URI encoding loop writes bytes into the allocated buffer directly using indexed assignments and bounds are established via fixed_uri_len, allocation of fixed_uri_len + 1, and the mhd_assert that fixed_uri_len == o before zero-termination). The call to transmit_error_response_header is an application function (not a <string.h> call) and, while it may internally use string functions, its internals are outside the provided code snippet and should be inspected separately if needed. Therefore no other code fragments in this snippet directly fall under Rule 21.17."
