  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Items that might look suspicious at a glance but are standard C (not extensions) and therefore do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2: \n\n- Backslash line continuation in source (e.g. after the <= operator and inside string literals): this is a standard preprocessor line-continuation/adjacent-string-literal usage, not a compiler extension.\n- Declaration of a local variable inside the block (const char chr = ... inside the loop): valid since C99 and later; not a compiler extension.\n- Hex integer constants in case labels (case 0x0B, case 0x0C): standard integer constant usage in switch statements.\n- Use of adjacent/concatenated string literals and the localization macro _(...): the _ identifier is a macro (commonly gettext); using it is a macro invocation, not a language extension. Splitting long string literals across lines via adjacent literals is standard C.\n- Function-like macro invocation with a space between macro name and '(': allowed/preprocessed normally (commonly seen as MACRO (arg)). This is not a compiler extension.\n- Use of standard library functions and types (malloc, free, memcpy, NULL): standard C library usage, not an extension.\n- Use of character literals, comparisons, and byte handling (including '\t', '\r', '\n', 0): standard C.\n\nNo constructs such as inline assembly, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ or other compiler-specific keywords/attributes, nonstandard pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions are present in the snippet. Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
