  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs a write to context->message_block[57] (an array element), not a pointer declaration or assignment. MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified where possible. Because this code writes into message_block, it must be writable (non-const), so there is no violation. (A violation would exist only if a pointer variable were declared non-const but never modified and could be const-qualified.)"
