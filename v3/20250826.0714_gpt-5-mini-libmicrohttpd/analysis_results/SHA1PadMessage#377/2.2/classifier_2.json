Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1PadMessage:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1PadMessage (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (context->message_block_index > 55)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 64)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n    SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  context->message_block[56] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 24);\n  context->message_block[57] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 16);\n  context->message_block[58] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 8);\n  context->message_block[59] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high);\n  context->message_block[60] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 24);\n  context->message_block[61] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 16);\n  context->message_block[62] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 8);\n  context->message_block[63] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low);\n  SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The loop fills the message block with zero padding up to byte 56 as part of the SHA-1 padding procedure. It is executed in both branches of the surrounding code (directly in the else branch, and after SHA1ProcessMessageBlock in the if branch) and modifies context->message_block and message_block_index. Removing this loop would change the produced padded message and thus program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
