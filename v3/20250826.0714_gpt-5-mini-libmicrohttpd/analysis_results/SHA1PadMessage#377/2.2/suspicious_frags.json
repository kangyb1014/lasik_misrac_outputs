  "explanation": "I flagged the individual assignments of the 0x80 byte (both occurrences), the zero-fill loops (both occurrences), both calls to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock, and the block of final length-byte assignments because these operations are state-changing and are common places where inadvertent redundant or overwritten writes can occur \u2014 they should be inspected to confirm none of the executed operations are actually removable without changing program behaviour (i.e. to rule out dead code according to MISRA Rule 2.2). Other parts of the function (function signature, the if/else control structure itself and the overall padding sequence layout) are not reported because they are the expected control flow for SHA-1 padding: the function condition selects the correct padding path, and the sequence of placing the padding marker, zero-filling to block boundaries and appending the 64-bit length are necessary to produce the correct hash. Those elements are required for correct behaviour and are not, on their face, dead code."
