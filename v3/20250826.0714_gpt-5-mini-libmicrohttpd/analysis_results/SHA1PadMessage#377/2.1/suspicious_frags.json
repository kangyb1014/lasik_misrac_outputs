  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the control-flow and buffer-manipulating statements whose reachability depends on the runtime value of context->message_block_index and on the behavior of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (which may modify message_block_index). These are the locations most likely to contain unreachable code or to cause later code to be unreachable (loops that may never be entered, calls that may change state making subsequent loops dead, and the final writes that presume a valid buffer state). Other parts of the function (function signature, simple braces, and the increment operations as part of the shown assignments) are straightforward, syntactically reachable, and do not by themselves create unreachable code, so they do not require separate investigation."
