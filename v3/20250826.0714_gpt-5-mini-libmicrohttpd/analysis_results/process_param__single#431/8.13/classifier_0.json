  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: param_name is declared as const char * in the function signature, so the pointer already points to a const-qualified type. Using fprintf with %s does not modify the pointee. (A violation would occur if param_name were declared as char * while referring to non-modifiable data or string literals.)"
