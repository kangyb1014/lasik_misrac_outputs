  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided function. The code only calls fprintf and performs a direct character comparison (param_name[1] == '-'), which is not a call to memcmp and therefore not subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. No other fragments in this function invoke memcmp or any obvious wrapper around memcmp, so there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
