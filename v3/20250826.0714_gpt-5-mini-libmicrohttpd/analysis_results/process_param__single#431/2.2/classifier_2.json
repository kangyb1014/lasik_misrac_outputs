  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__single:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__single (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.shared)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-S' or '--shared'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.unique)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-U' or '--unique'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.single = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.single = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical use: the assignment sets tool_params.single to true (using '! 0') to record the option and affects subsequent program behavior, so it is not dead. A concrete violation scenario would be if tool_params.single is never read anywhere after this assignment (or is overwritten before any read) \u2014 in that case the assignment would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
