  "explanation": "There is no direct call to MHD_start_daemon within this function, so no direct recursion. The only function invocation that could create indirect recursion is the call to MHD_start_daemon_va (listed above) \u2014 that callee should be inspected to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) calls MHD_start_daemon. The variadic handling (va_start/va_end) and the fact that callbacks (apc, dh) are merely passed through and not invoked here mean they are not sources of recursion in this fragment. Other lines (macro storage-class specifier, local variable declarations, return) do not introduce direct or indirect self-calls and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
