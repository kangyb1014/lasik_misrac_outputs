  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_start_daemon:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Daemon *\nMHD_start_daemon (unsigned int flags,\n                  uint16_t port,\n                  MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback apc,\n                  void *apc_cls,\n                  MHD_AccessHandlerCallback dh,\n                  void *dh_cls,\n                  ...)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n  va_list ap;\n\n  va_start (ap,\n            dh_cls);\n  daemon = MHD_start_daemon_va (flags,\n                                port,\n                                apc,\n                                apc_cls,\n                                dh,\n                                dh_cls,\n                                ap);\n  va_end (ap);\n  return daemon;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nva_list ap;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the va_list variable 'ap' is used by va_start(ap, dh_cls), passed to MHD_start_daemon_va(..., ap) and cleaned up with va_end(ap). Removing the declaration would change program behavior/usage of variadic arguments. (If a va_list were declared but never referenced by va_start/va_end or passed/used, that would be a dead-code violation.)"
