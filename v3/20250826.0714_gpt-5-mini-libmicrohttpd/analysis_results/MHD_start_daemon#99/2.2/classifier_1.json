Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_start_daemon:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Daemon *\nMHD_start_daemon (unsigned int flags,\n                  uint16_t port,\n                  MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback apc,\n                  void *apc_cls,\n                  MHD_AccessHandlerCallback dh,\n                  void *dh_cls,\n                  ...)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n  va_list ap;\n\n  va_start (ap,\n            dh_cls);\n  daemon = MHD_start_daemon_va (flags,\n                                port,\n                                apc,\n                                apc_cls,\n                                dh,\n                                dh_cls,\n                                ap);\n  va_end (ap);\n  return daemon;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn daemon;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
