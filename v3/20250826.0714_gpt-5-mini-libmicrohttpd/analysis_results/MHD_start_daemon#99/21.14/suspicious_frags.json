  "explanation": "I inspected the provided MHD_start_daemon implementation and found no use of memcmp (or any other raw byte-compare) to compare null-terminated strings. The code only declares local variables, uses va_list/va_start/va_end, calls MHD_start_daemon_va, and returns the result. None of these lines perform string comparisons or call memcmp directly. Note: any use of memcmp inside the called function MHD_start_daemon_va or other external functions is outside the provided fragment and therefore not reported here."
