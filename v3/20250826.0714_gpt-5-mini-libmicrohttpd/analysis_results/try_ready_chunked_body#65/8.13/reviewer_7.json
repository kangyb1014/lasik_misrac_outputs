True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code passes a translated string literal _( \"Closing connection (application error generating response).\" ) to CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR. If either the _ translation macro or the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR macro/function expects or produces a non-const char * (which is common for legacy gettext APIs), then a pointer to a non-const char is being used to refer to an immutable string literal. That is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Remedy: ensure the translation function and the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR API use const char * (or cast appropriately) so the pointer points to a const-qualified type.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report describes a plausible MISRA 8.13 violation, but it cannot be proven from the snippet alone. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The code passes a string literal (via the translation macro _()) into CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR. Whether that is a violation depends on the declared parameter/return types of _ and CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR: \n\n- If either _ or CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR has a prototype that takes/returns a non-const char * (e.g. char *), then a pointer that may refer to an immutable string literal is being used as a non-const pointer, which is exactly the situation MISRA 8.13 aims to avoid \u2014 so the report would be correct. Historically, some gettext APIs return char * for compatibility, which makes this a realistic risk. \n\n- If _ is declared to return const char * and CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR accepts a const char * (or CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR accepts const char * and _ returns const char *), then no 8.13 violation is present in this call. \n\nBecause the declarations of _ and CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR are not provided, you cannot definitively conclude a violation from the code alone. Recommended remedies: ensure the translation macro/function and the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR prototype use const char * for string arguments/returns where appropriate, or add an explicit cast to const char * at the call site only if you have verified that the callee will not modify the string."
