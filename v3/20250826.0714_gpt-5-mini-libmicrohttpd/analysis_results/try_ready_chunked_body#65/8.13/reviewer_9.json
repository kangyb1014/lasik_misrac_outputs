In practice the gettext-style _() often returns char * and the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR/logging API may take a char *; passing a literal to a non-const char * parameter violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The correct approach is to ensure the callee/macro parameter is declared const char * (or modify the translation macro to return const char *), so the pointer to the literal is const-qualified.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report as stated is not proven by the snippet alone. MISRA\u2011C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (they should be const\u2011qualified when possible). Whether a violation occurs depends on the declarations of the called macro/function and of the _() macro: if CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (or the function it expands to) is declared to take a non\u2011const char * parameter and that parameter is not modified, then MISRA 8.13 would be violated and the API should be changed to take a const char * (or _() should produce const char *). However the provided code does not show the prototype of CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR or the expansion/type returned by _(), so you cannot conclude a violation from this code alone. Recommended action: inspect the declarations of CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR and _(); if they take non\u2011const char * but do not modify the string, change them to take const char * (or adjust the translation macro) to satisfy Rule 8.13."
