  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified whenever they can be (i.e. function parameters that do not modify the pointed-to object should be declared const T *). The code shown calls CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR(..., _(\"...\")). Whether there is a Rule 8.13 violation depends on the declarations of CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR and the _ macro/function: if either is declared to accept a non-const char * for the message parameter, then that declaration would be contrary to 8.13 (and passing a string literal highlights that the parameter should be const). However, the violation is in the prototype/declaration of those macros/functions, not in this call site; the snippet alone does not show those declarations, so you cannot prove a violation from this file alone. In short: the scenario described by agent A is plausible and would indeed be a Rule 8.13 violation if CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR or _ are declared to take a non-const char *; but based on the provided code alone there is insufficient evidence to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. Recommended action: inspect the declarations of CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR and _, and if they use char * for a message that is not modified, change them to const char * (do not remove const by casting at call sites)."
