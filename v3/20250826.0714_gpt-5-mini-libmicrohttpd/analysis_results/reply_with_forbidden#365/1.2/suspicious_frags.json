  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function and object storage-class specifiers, enum, const, size_t, sizeof, standard function calls, C block comments, and an explicit (void) cast to ignore a return value. The backslash at the end of the first string line is a standard source-line continuation (not a compiler extension), and adjacent string literals (with or without the backslash) are standard concatenation. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, pragmas that are non-standard, or other vendor-specific extensions present. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
