  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines such as \"(void) upload_data;\" are the common idiom to explicitly mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. While removing such a statement would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour, MISRA\u2019s concern with Rule 2.2 is about unintended/dead code that masks logic errors or can be removed without consequence; explicit casts-to-void used to document/acknowledge unused parameters are an accepted, intentional annotation rather than inadvertent dead code. In practice you should prefer omitting the parameter name in the function signature (where possible) or use the explicit (void)param idiom to show intent. Thus the claim that this specific statement constitutes a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
