  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The POSIX prototype for sigaction is int sigaction(int, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact); the second parameter is a pointer-to-const, and &sig (type struct sigaction *) is implicitly converted to const struct sigaction *. The code therefore passes a const-qualified parameter as required. A violation would occur only if the sigaction prototype lacked the const qualifier for the 'act' parameter (or if a non-const pointer were stored in a pointer variable where const could be used), which is not the case here."
