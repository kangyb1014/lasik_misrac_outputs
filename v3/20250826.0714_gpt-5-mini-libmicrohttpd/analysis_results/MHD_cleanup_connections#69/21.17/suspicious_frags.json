  "explanation": "The function MHD_cleanup_connections itself contains no direct calls to the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn are called here). Therefore most statements (DLL_remove, EDLL_remove, epoll_ctl, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free(pos->addr), free(pos), list/flag manipulations, mutex operations, MHD_PANIC, etc.) do not need investigation under Rule 21.17 because they do not present direct uses of the standard string handling functions nor do they pass raw buffer+length parameters that could obviously lead to out-of-bounds string operations from this call site.\n\nThe fragments listed in suspicious_frags are the call sites within this function that pass pointers (and in one case a pointer with an explicit length) or complex objects to other functions or callbacks. Those callees (notify_connection callback, MHD_ip_limit_del, cleanup_upgraded_connection, MHD_pool_destroy, gnutls_deinit, MHD_destroy_response) may internally use <string.h> functions and could therefore lead to out-of-bounds accesses if provided pointers/lengths are incorrect. These are the relevant locations that other agents should inspect further (by examining the implementations of the called functions or the contract/validation of the passed buffers) for compliance with Rule 21.17. No other fragments in this function warrant investigation under Rule 21.17 because they do not involve passing pointer parameters that would reasonably be used with the standard string handling functions."
