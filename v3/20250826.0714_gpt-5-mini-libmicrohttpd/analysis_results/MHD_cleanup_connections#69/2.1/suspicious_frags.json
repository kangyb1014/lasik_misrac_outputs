  "explanation": "I flagged all conditional-compilation blocks and conditional branches that can be compiled out or may be permanently false given a particular project configuration (thread support blocks, UPGRADE_SUPPORT, HTTPS_SUPPORT, EPOLL_SUPPORT) as well as the thread-join / panic branch and the epoll removal panic path. Those fragments are the typical places that can become statically unreachable in a given build or configuration and therefore deserve inspection for Rule 2.1.\n\nThe remaining code in the function (the while loop head: while (NULL != (pos = daemon->cleanup_tail)), the DLL_remove call, MHD_pool_destroy(pos->pool), the notify_connection invocation, MHD_ip_limit_del, and the counter/tail bookkeeping at the end of the loop) are essential cleanup operations executed when daemon->cleanup_tail is non-NULL and are not obviously statically unreachable. They contain no constant-false conditions, unconditional returns or jumps that would make subsequent statements unreachable in the shown source, so they do not require investigation for unreachable-code under Rule 2.1 based solely on this snippet."
