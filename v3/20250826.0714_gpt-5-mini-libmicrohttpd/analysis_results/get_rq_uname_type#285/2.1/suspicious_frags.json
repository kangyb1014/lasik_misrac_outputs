  "explanation": "No unreachable code was detected in the provided function. Reasoning: every control path terminates in a return and the branching conditions are mutually covering: (1) if params->username.value.str != NULL then the nested test on params->username_ext.value.str leads to one of two return values (the ternary returns one of two values based on params->userhash), (2) else if params->username_ext.value.str != NULL handles the case when only the extended username is present and returns one of two values depending on the boolean and length checks, and (3) otherwise the final return handles the case when both are NULL. There are no statements after unconditional returns that would be unreachable, no duplicate mutually-exclusive branches that can never be taken, and no dead code constructs visible in the snippet. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
