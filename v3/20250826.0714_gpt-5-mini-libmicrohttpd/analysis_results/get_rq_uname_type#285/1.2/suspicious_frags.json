  "explanation": "No other language/compiler-specific extension syntax is present in the function body. The code uses only standard C constructs: pointer dereferences and NULL comparisons, if/else control flow, the conditional (?:) operator, enum return values, integer/boolean expressions, and comments. There are no uses of commonly documented compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (explicit), typeof, _Alignas/_Alignof, _Noreturn, or other compiler-specific keywords or built-ins. Identifier naming (underscores) is not by itself a language extension. Therefore only the function declaration line that uses the macro-like token _MHD_static_inline needs investigation (to see how that macro expands and whether it introduces compiler-specific extensions); the remainder does not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
