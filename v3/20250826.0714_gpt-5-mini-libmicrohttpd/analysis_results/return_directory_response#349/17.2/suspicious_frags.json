  "explanation": "Recursion (direct or indirect) can only arise from function calls reachable from return_directory_response. The code contains only the function calls listed above; these calls are therefore the only places that could (possibly) invoke return_directory_response again (e.g. via callbacks inside the library functions). Other fragments in the function are simple variable checks/assignments/returns (the if/else test on cached_directory_response, the enum declaration, and the final return ret;) and do not perform function calls that could cause recursion, so they do not need investigation."
