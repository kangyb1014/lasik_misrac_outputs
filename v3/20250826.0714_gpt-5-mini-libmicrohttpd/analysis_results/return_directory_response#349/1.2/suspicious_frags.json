  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. I inspected the code for common extensions documented by compilers (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, asm/inline assembly, labels-as-values, computed goto, token-pasting or variadic macro extensions, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or other nonstandard keywords). None appear in the snippet. The constructs present are standard C: a static function returning an enum type, a pointer parameter to a struct, calls to library functions (pthread_mutex_lock/unlock, MHD_queue_response) and use of NULL and enum constants. Casting the call result to (void) to ignore it is standard C practice, and use of POSIX threads or external library APIs (MHD_*) are library/API usage, not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
