  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of return_directory_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  (void) pthread_mutex_lock (&mutex);\n  if (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n                              internal_error_response);\n  else\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n  (void) pthread_mutex_unlock (&mutex);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function contains no dead code. All executed operations\u2014pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock and the calls to MHD_queue_response whose results are returned\u2014affect program behaviour; the (void) casts only discard return values and do not make the calls dead. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
