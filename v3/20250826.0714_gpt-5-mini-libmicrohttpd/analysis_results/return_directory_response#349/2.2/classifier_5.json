Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of return_directory_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nreturn_directory_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  (void) pthread_mutex_lock (&mutex);\n  if (NULL == cached_directory_response)\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n                              internal_error_response);\n  else\n    ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n  (void) pthread_mutex_unlock (&mutex);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                              MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                              cached_directory_response);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call to MHD_queue_response(connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, cached_directory_response) enqueues the HTTP_OK response using cached_directory_response. Removing this call would change program behaviour (no response queued), so it is not dead code. This fragment would only be dead if the function call had no observable side-effects and its return value was never used (for example if MHD_queue_response were a no-op in the build), or if alternate code proved that the call is always executed but its presence/absence never affects the system \u2014 only in those contrived cases could it violate Rule 2.2. Note: if the branch were never executed it would be unreachable (MISRA note 2), which is distinct from dead code."
