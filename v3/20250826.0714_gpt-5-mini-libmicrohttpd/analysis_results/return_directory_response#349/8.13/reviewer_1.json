  "explanation": "The code fragment as shown does not itself contain any pointer declarations, so you cannot determine a Rule 8.13 violation from this snippet alone. The agent\u2019s scenario is plausible: if internal_error_response (and/or cached_directory_response) are declared as modifiable pointers (e.g. \"struct MHD_Response *internal_error_response;\") yet the pointed objects are never modified and are only used read\u2011only, then those declarations should be const\u2011qualified and that declaration would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. However, whether you can or should add const also depends on the API: if MHD_queue_response is declared to take a non\u2011const pointer, you cannot simply change the local declarations without a cast or changing the API. Therefore the agent\u2019s claim is conditionally correct (it describes a real possible violation) but is not provably correct given only the shown code. Check the actual declarations and the prototype of MHD_queue_response; if the objects are never modified and the API allows it, change the pointers to point to const to comply with Rule 8.13."
