  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not marked because they do not present potential violations of Rule 8.13: the mutex operations use &mutex passed to pthread_mutex_lock()/pthread_mutex_unlock(), which require a modifiable pthread_mutex_t pointer (so const is not appropriate); the local variable \"ret\" and the enum/constant tokens (e.g. MHD_HTTP_OK) are not pointers; other syntax (braces, casts to void for pthread calls) are not pointer declarations or uses that could be const-qualified. The three reported fragments are the only pointer-related usages in this snippet that merit investigation (the function parameter of pointer type and the two uses of response objects) because their pointee types might be eligible for const-qualification; their actual declarations are outside this snippet and should be checked."
