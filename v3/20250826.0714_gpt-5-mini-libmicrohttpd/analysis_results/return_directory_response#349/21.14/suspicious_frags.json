  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp (nor to strcmp/strncmp or other string-comparison functions) \u2014 it only performs a pointer comparison against NULL, calls MHD_queue_response, and uses pthread_mutex_lock/unlock. There are no string operations or uses of memcmp in this fragment, so there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
