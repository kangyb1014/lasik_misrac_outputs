  "explanation": "No loop controlling expressions are present in the function: there are no for, while or do-while constructs to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 applies. The only conditional is the if (NULL == cached_directory_response) test; that expression is not invariant (it depends on the value of cached_directory_response, which can change and is protected by a mutex). The pthread_mutex_lock/unlock calls and the calls to MHD_queue_response are not controlling expressions for iteration. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
