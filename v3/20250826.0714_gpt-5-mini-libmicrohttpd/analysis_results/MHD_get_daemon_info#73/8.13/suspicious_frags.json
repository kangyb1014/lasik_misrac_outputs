  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could/should point to const-qualified data. The fragments selected are the points where addresses of daemon-owned non-const member objects are returned (address-of expressions) and where those member objects are written immediately prior to being returned. Also the function declaration (pointer parameter and return pointer) is included for inspection to verify whether the parameter or returned pointer types should be const-qualified. Other parts of the function do not declare pointer types or take/return addresses (e.g. mhd_assert lines, case labels returning NULL, the loop index declaration 'unsigned int i', the worker_pool read accesses, preprocessor conditionals, and comments). Those other fragments either do not involve pointer declarations/returns or they clearly modify daemon state (so the daemon parameter cannot be const), therefore they are not relevant to investigation of whether pointers should point to const-qualified types under Rule 8.13."
