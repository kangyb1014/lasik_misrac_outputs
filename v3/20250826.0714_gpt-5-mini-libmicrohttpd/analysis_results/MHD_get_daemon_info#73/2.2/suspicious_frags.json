  "explanation": "I flagged all assignments and control-flow branches that perform operations whose removal could be unnoticed (e.g. writing to the daemon_info_dummy_* structures, updating daemon->connections, the loop that aggregates worker_pool connections, the conditional call to MHD_cleanup_connections, the two assert statements, and the two explicit 'no longer supported' return-NULL cases). These are the points most likely to contain executed operations that might be removable without changing observable behaviour (dead code) and therefore warrant inspection.\n\nFragments not listed as suspicious are not included because they are required for correct control flow or are defensive/structural and not candidates for dead code: the function signature and prologue, the initial NULL check (guards against dereference), the switch statement and its default return NULL (necessary to handle unknown info_type values), the preprocessor guards (#ifdef/#endif) that select supported functionality, local variable declarations (e.g. 'unsigned int i;') and comments. These elements are structural or necessary for correctness and are unlikely to be dead code per MISRA C Rule 2.2 without further context."
