  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific extensions that compilers explicitly document as extensions.\n- No inline assembly or pragmas are present.\n- All control-flow and type usage is standard C (standard integer and pointer types, casts, array indexing, bitwise ops, loops, function return).  \n- The use of ssize_t and size_t are library/ABI types (ssize_t is a POSIX typedef provided by system headers) rather than a compiler language extension; their presence does not itself indicate a compiler language extension (if required, the project should ensure the appropriate headers are included).  \n- Calls to malloc are standard C library usage, not a language extension.\n\nGiven the code shown, there are no fragments that match compiler-documented language extensions and therefore nothing to flag for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
