  "explanation": "The only potential recursion concern in this function is the call to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n \u2014 it could introduce indirect recursion if that function (directly or indirectly) calls MHD_lookup_connection_value. Therefore the call site and the function definition are flagged for investigation. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the local declaration and initialization of value, the ternary expression computing the key length, the call to strlen (a C library function that will not call user code here), the assignment and the return statement do not introduce direct or indirect calls to MHD_lookup_connection_value and so cannot cause self-calls by themselves. No other function calls are present in this snippet, so no additional fragments are relevant to Rule 17.2."
