  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_connection_value:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_lookup_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key)\n{\n  const char *value;\n\n  value = NULL;\n  (void) MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                        kind,\n                                        key,\n                                        (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key),\n                                        &value,\n                                        NULL);\n  return value;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the ternary expression is required to avoid calling strlen(NULL). If key is NULL the expression yields 0; if key is non-NULL it yields strlen(key). Removing the conditional (or the strlen call) would change program behaviour (and could cause undefined behaviour when key == NULL), so this operation is not dead code."
