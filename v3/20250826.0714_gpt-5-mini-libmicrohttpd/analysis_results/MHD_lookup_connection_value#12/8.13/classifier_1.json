  "scenario": "If neither MHD_lookup_connection_value nor the called MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (and other callees) modify the pointed-to object and their APIs could accept a pointer-to-const, then the parameter should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection'. In that case the current declaration 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. However, with only the shown fragment and no evidence that the object is not modified (or that callees accept const), a violation cannot be concluded."
