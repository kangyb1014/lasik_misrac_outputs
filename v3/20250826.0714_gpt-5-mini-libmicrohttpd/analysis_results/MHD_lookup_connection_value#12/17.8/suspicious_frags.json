  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function appears to modify any function parameter variable. The parameters are: 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', 'enum MHD_ValueKind kind', and 'const char *key'. In the body: a local variable 'value' is declared and assigned; the ternary expression '(NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen(key)' only reads 'key' and does not modify it; there are no assignments to 'connection', 'kind', or 'key'. Passing these parameters to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n does not itself constitute modification of the parameter variables in this function (even if the called function modifies the object pointed to by 'connection', that is allowed by the rule). The only pointer written to is '&value', which is a local variable, not a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
