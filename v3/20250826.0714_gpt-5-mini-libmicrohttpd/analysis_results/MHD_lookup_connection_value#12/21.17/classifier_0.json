  "scenario": "The code itself avoids calling strlen when key is NULL (uses (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen(key)), so it does not pass a NULL pointer to strlen. Therefore, assuming the function contract guarantees that a non-NULL key points to a valid NUL-terminated character array, this call does not violate Rule 21.17. A concrete violation scenario would be if key is non-NULL but does not point to a NUL-terminated buffer (for example, a char array of fixed length that contains no terminating '\\0' within its bounds or a pointer into a larger object where no terminator is present); in that case strlen(key) can read beyond the bounds of the object and would violate the rule."
