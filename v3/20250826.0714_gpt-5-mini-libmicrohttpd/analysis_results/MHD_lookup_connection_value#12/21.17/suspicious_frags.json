  "explanation": "No other uses of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided snippet. The remaining lines are simple declarations, an assignment (value = NULL;), the function prototype/return type, and a return statement; none of these perform string handling or buffer manipulation that could trigger Rule 21.17. Therefore only the call that invokes strlen (contained in the shown MHD_lookup_connection_value_n call) needs investigation."
