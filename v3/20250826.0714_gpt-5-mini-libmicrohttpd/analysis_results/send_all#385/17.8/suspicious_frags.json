  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameters sock, buf, or len.\n- The pointer parameter buf is only read and used as &buf[off] (pointer arithmetic on a local index), which does not modify the pointer variable itself nor the object it points to.\n- The cast to (const void *) preserves constness; no const is cast away.\n- The cast of (len - off) to (int) on the Windows branch is a value conversion, not a modification of the parameter.\n- All mutated variables (ret, off) are local to the function.\nTherefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
