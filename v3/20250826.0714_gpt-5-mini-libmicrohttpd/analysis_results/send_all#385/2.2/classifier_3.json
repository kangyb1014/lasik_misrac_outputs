  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_all:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], len - off, 0);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], (int) (len - off), 0);\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return off;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "If send() returns 0 (no bytes sent), the break exits the loop and allows the function to return the number of bytes already sent. Removing the 'if (0 == ret) { break; }' would leave 'off' unchanged (off += (size_t)ret adds 0) and would typically cause an infinite loop or otherwise change program behaviour. Therefore this code is not dead and does not violate Rule 2.2."
