  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression is 'off < len'. 'off' is modified by the loop increment (off += (size_t) ret) and thus the controlling expression is not syntactically invariant. Note: at run-time the loop can become stuck if send() repeatedly returns EAGAIN (the code sets ret = 0 and continue, so off does not advance), but that is a runtime behavior, not a static invariant of the controlling expression. Therefore the MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not violated."
