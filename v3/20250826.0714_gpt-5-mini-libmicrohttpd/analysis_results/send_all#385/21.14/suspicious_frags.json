  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the provided function does not call memcmp (or any string comparison function such as strcmp/strncmp), nor does it perform any comparison of null-terminated strings. The code operates on a byte buffer (const unsigned char *buf) with an explicit length parameter (len) and uses send for socket I/O. Therefore there is no use of the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and nothing in this snippet requires further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
