  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses standard C constructs (enum return type, function definition, pointer and size_t parameters, NULL checks, if statements, function calls and returns). There are no explicit compiler extension tokens present such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other well-known vendor extensions. The only items that could hide compiler-specific extensions are the macros listed as suspicious above; those macros are commonly used to wrap platform/compiler-specific attributes or linkage annotations and therefore should be investigated. All other identifiers and expressions in the snippet are ordinary C and do not by themselves indicate use of documented compiler language extensions."
