Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_post_process:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_post_process (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                  const char *post_data,\n                  size_t post_data_len)\n{\n  if (0 == post_data_len)\n    return MHD_YES;\n  if (NULL == pp)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (MHD_HTTP_POST_ENCODING_FORM_URLENCODED,\n                                 pp->encoding,\n                                 MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\n                                   MHD_HTTP_POST_ENCODING_FORM_URLENCODED)))\n    return post_process_urlencoded (pp,\n                                    post_data,\n                                    post_data_len);\n  if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (MHD_HTTP_POST_ENCODING_MULTIPART_FORMDATA,\n                                 pp->encoding,\n                                 MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\n                                   MHD_HTTP_POST_ENCODING_MULTIPART_FORMDATA)))\n    return post_process_multipart (pp,\n                                   post_data,\n                                   post_data_len);\n  /* this should never be reached */\n  return MHD_NO;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (0 == post_data_len)\n    return MHD_YES;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
