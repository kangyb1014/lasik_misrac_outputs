  "explanation": "The two dispatched branches (the if-blocks that compare the encoding and then call post_process_urlencoded or post_process_multipart) contain calls to other functions and therefore must be investigated for possible indirect recursion back to MHD_post_process. Other fragments in the function do not require investigation for Rule 17.2: the initial guard checks (if (0 == post_data_len) return MHD_YES; and if (NULL == pp) return MHD_NO;), the function signature/declaration, the final comment and return MHD_NO;, and plain use of constants/macros do not perform function calls that could cause direct or indirect self-calls and so are not relevant to this recursion rule."
