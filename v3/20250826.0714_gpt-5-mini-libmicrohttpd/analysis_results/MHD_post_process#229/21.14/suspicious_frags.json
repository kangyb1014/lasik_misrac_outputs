  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp appears in this function. The only fragments that perform string comparisons and therefore might internally use memcmp (against null-terminated strings) are the two calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_. All other code in this function does not perform string comparisons: the early returns checking post_data_len == 0 and pp == NULL are simple scalar checks; the calls to post_process_urlencoded/post_process_multipart are invocations but do not show string-comparison logic here (their internals would need separate review). The final unreachable return and the function signature do not involve string comparisons. Therefore only the two MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ usages require investigation for possible memcmp-on-null-terminated-string violations; the rest of the fragments need not be investigated in the context of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
