  "explanation": "The remaining code contains active control flow and data-dependent operations that clearly affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code: the conditional if (param->quoted) selects between two different comparison implementations (MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n versus the length check + memcmp), both of which are executed depending on runtime state; the length comparison and memcmp are required to determine equality when not quoted; the function signature and inline/static qualifiers affect linkage and inlining but are not dead code. There is no unreachable code in the function body. The two mhd_assert lines are flagged because assertion macros are commonly compiled out or become no-ops in some build configurations, meaning their removal would not change program behaviour (they may therefore represent code whose presence is optional), so they warrant investigation under MISRA Rule 2.2."
