For example, with mhd_assert implemented like the standard assert (abort on failure in debug, no code emitted in release) the check has no effect on correct runs and its removal would not change behaviour \u2014 therefore it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Whether the mhd_assert invocation is \u201cdead code\u201d depends on the project build configuration being analysed. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If mhd_assert is enabled in some builds (e.g. debug) and can abort or otherwise change behaviour when its condition fails, removing the call would change behaviour in those builds, so it is not dead code. The agent\u2019s argument hinges on looking only at a build where mhd_assert expands to nothing; in that single build the assertion call is simply not present, and there is nothing to mark as dead in that build. Conversely, if mhd_assert truly expands to nothing in every project configuration (i.e. the macro never emits code anywhere in the project), then any occurrence is effectively redundant and could be considered dead \u2014 but that is a different situation than the one the agent described. In short: given the typical assert-like definition (diagnostic in some builds, removed in others) the assertion is not dead code under MISRA 2.2, so the reported violation is incorrect."
