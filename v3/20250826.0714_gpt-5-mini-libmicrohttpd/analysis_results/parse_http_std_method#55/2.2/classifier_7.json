Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_http_std_method:\n```c\nstatic void\nparse_http_std_method (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                       const char *method,\n                       size_t len)\n{\n  const char *const m = method; /**< short alias */\n  mhd_assert (NULL != m);\n  mhd_assert (0 != len);\n\n  if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET) == len) &&\n      (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_GET;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_POST) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_POST, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_POST;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_PUT) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_PUT, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_PUT;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_DELETE) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_DELETE, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_DELETE;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_CONNECT) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_CONNECT, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_CONNECT;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_OPTIONS) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_OPTIONS, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_OPTIONS;\n  else if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_TRACE) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_TRACE, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_TRACE;\n  else\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_OTHER;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nelse if ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_DELETE) == len) &&\n           (0 == memcmp (m, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_DELETE, len)))\n    connection->rq.http_mthd = MHD_HTTP_MTHD_DELETE;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment to connection->rq.http_mthd for the DELETE method is executed only when the incoming method string matches \"DELETE\"; removing it would change program behaviour for DELETE requests (the request method would not be recorded). This is not dead code. (A violation would only occur in a contrived case where the field is guaranteed to already hold MHD_HTTP_MTHD_DELETE and that value is never used/observably different \u2014 not the situation shown.)"
