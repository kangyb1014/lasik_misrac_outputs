  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The function contains a single cascade of conditional controlling expressions (the if / else if conditions listed above), so those are reported for investigation. Other code fragments in the function are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to this rule: the declarations and aliasing (const char *const m = method;), the mhd_assert calls (which are not conditional statements here), and the assignment statements that set connection->rq.http_mthd are not controlling expressions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.3. There are no loops or switch statements in this function that would introduce additional controlling expressions to check."
