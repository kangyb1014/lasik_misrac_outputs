  "explanation": "No pointer in this function lacks a const-qualified pointee where possible. The function parameters are: (1) struct MHD_Connection *connection \u2014 must be non-const because the function writes to connection->rq.http_mthd; (2) const char *method \u2014 already points to const data; (3) const char *const m \u2014 a local alias that is both pointer- and pointee-const. The string macros (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_...) are used only for comparison and are passed to memcmp which accepts const void *. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-non-const references that could reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types, so no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
