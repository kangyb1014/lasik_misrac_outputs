  "scenario": "The function takes a pointer to struct MHD_Connection but only reads from it (uses c->rq.http_mthd, no writes). The parameter is declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' and the local alias is 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;' \u2014 neither makes the pointed-to object const. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In this case the pointee can and should be const (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection' and 'const struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;')."
