  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the active code are invariant. The function's control points are: the two mhd_assert(...) macros and the if-statements\n- if (199 >= rcode)\n- if (MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT == rcode)\n- if (MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD == c->rq.http_mthd)\n- if (MHD_HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED == rcode)\nEach of these depends on either the parameter 'rcode' or the connection state 'c->rq.http_mthd' (runtime values) and therefore are not invariant. The mhd_assert macros evaluate expressions involving 'rcode' and are not constant; if the assert macro is compiled out, no controlling statement remains. The file also contains two disabled code regions (#if 0) that include additional if-statements; those blocks are excluded from compilation by the preprocessor and thus need not be considered for MISRA Rule 14.3 analysis of the active code. No loops with constant controlling expressions or unconditional invariant if/while/do-while constructs are present in the compiled code, so there are no fragments requiring investigation under Rule 14.3."
