  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the provided function. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; to be relevant there must be a call to memcmp (or similar misuse of memcmp) comparing character arrays or string literals. A review of the code shows only: - integer comparisons of rcode with numeric literals and named HTTP constants (e.g. 199 >= rcode, MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT == rcode), - comparisons of an enum/integer http method field (MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD == c->rq.http_mthd), - a NULL pointer comparison in an #if 0 commented-out block (no active code), and - uses of mhd_assert (not memcmp). There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any string.h functions in this fragment, and no instance of comparing null-terminated strings via memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14 in this function."
