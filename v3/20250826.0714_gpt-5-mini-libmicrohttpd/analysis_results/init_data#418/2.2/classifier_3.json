Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of init_data:\n```c\nstatic int\ninit_data (void)\n{\n  unsigned int i;\n\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n    body_dyn_size = 8U * 1024U;\n  else if (tool_params.large)\n    body_dyn_size = 1024U * 1024U;\n  else\n    body_dyn_size = 0;\n\n  if (! init_response_body_data ())\n    return 25;\n\n  if (tool_params.unique)\n    return 0; /* Responses are generated on-fly */\n\n  if (tool_params.single)\n  {\n    resp_single = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resp_single)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create response.\\n\");\n      return 25;\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  /* Use more responses to minimise waiting in threads while the response\n     used by other thread. */\n  if (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    num_resps = 16 * get_num_threads ();\n  else\n    num_resps = 16 * get_cpu_core_count ();\n\n  resps = (struct MHD_Response **)\n          malloc ((sizeof(struct MHD_Response *)) * num_resps);\n  if (NULL == resps)\n  {\n    if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    {\n      free (body_dyn);\n      body_dyn = NULL;\n    }\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to allocate memory.\\n\");\n    return 25;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)\n  {\n    resps[i] = create_response_object ();\n    if (NULL == resps[i])\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to create responses.\\n\");\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (i == num_resps)\n    return 0; /* Success */\n\n  /* Cleanup */\n  while (--i < num_resps)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n  free (resps);\n  resps = NULL;\n  num_resps = 0;\n  if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    free (body_dyn);\n  body_dyn = NULL;\n  return 32;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n/* Cleanup */\n  while (--i < num_resps)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "When create_response_object() fails partway (for example it returns NULL at index k where 0 < k < num_resps), the code falls through to the cleanup path and the loop while (--i < num_resps) calls MHD_destroy_response on resps[k-1] down to resps[0] to free already-created responses. Removing this loop would change program behaviour (would leak those responses), so the loop is not dead code."
