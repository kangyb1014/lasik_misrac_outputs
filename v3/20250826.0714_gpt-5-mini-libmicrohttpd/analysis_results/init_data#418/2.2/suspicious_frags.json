  "explanation": "I selected fragments that control large alternative execution paths, allocation loops, and cleanup logic \u2014 these are the places most likely to contain operations that are executed but could be redundant or ineffective (i.e. potential dead code under Rule 2.2) and therefore should be investigated. I did not flag the other fragments because they are straightforward, necessary actions for initialization and error handling: the body_dyn_size assignments are needed to configure buffer size; the call to init_response_body_data() and its error return are required; the fprintf calls provide diagnosic side-effects; the returns on success or failure are control-flow decisions (MISRA notes that unreachable code is not dead code); freeing pointers and setting them to NULL is standard, non-redundant cleanup; and the arithmetic constants and simple assignments are not suspicious for dead code. In short, only the allocation/creation branches, their early-return branches, and the destruct/cleanup loop/conditions were marked for further review; the remaining lines perform evident, necessary work and do not appear to be dead code."
