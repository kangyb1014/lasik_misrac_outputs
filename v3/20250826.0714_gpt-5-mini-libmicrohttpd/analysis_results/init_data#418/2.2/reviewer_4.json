  "explanation": "Agent A's argument is not a correct application of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. While it is true in standard C that free(NULL) is a no-op, Rule 2.2 forbids only code whose removal would not affect program behaviour. MISRA explicitly notes that the behaviour of an embedded system can include timing and other side effects. Removing the conditional and always calling free(body_dyn) could (a) change timing characteristics, (b) call an implementation-instrumented free() that has side effects (logging, hooks, RTOS interactions), or (c) alter observable behaviour in environments where free has been wrapped or replaced. Because the submitter has not demonstrated that removal would have no effect in the target environment (including timing/side effects), the conditional cannot be reliably classified as dead code under Rule 2.2. Therefore the report of a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
