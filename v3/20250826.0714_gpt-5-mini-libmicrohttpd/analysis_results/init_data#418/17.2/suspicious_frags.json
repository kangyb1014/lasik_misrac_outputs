  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect self-calls. The only places where init_data could be reached indirectly are through the functions called from it. I therefore listed all call sites in this function that should be investigated to determine whether any of the called functions (or functions they call) call init_data back. Other code fragments in this function are simple local operations (assignments to variables, conditionals that test tool_params, arithmetic to set sizes/indices, returns, loop control, and comments) and do not themselves perform function calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2 in this context."
