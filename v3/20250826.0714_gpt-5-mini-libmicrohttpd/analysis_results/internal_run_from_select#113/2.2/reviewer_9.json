True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert call performs a pure runtime check that invokes MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_(daemon->tid), which (presumably) has no side effects and only reports an invariant. In normal correct operation the predicate is true, so the assertion only evaluates a boolean and does not alter program state. Thus the invocation is an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour (unless the assertion path aborts on failure). This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: if mhd_assert is a compile-time no-op in release builds the expression is not executed; Rule 2.2 applies to the case where the assertion is executed (e.g. in debug builds).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert invocation cannot be assumed to be dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 for several independent reasons:\n\n- An assertion is not purely documentation: when it fires it can change program behavior (log, abort, take other diagnostics). Removing it would remove that behavior in failure cases, so it is not an operation whose removal would never affect program behaviour.  \n- Even when the predicate is true in \"normal\" runs, the presence of the assertion can affect timing and observability (see Rule 2.2 Note 1). In an embedded system timing differences introduced by the extra check can change overall behaviour, so the check is not provably removable.  \n- The assertion macro may be active in some builds (debug) and absent in others (release). Whether it is executed is build-configuration dependent; MISRA analysis must consider the project\u2019s configurations. Code present and executed in some configuration is not dead simply because it\u2019s disabled in another.  \n- The predicate function (MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_) may perform reads of thread/OS state or other actions; it cannot be assumed to be side-effect-free without examining its definition. If it has any observable effect, the call is not dead.\n\nGiven these points, the mhd_assert call is not dead code under the MISRA definition, so Agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
