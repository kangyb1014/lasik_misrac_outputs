  "explanation": "The function print_perf_warnings has no parameters (signature: static void print_perf_warnings(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function. All assignments in the body (e.g. newline_needed |= !0) modify a local variable, not a parameter. Calls to fprintf and MHD_is_feature_supported pass pointers (stderr and string literals), but these are arguments to other functions and are not parameters of print_perf_warnings itself; this function does not modify any pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
