  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or obvious patterns that would indicate memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings (e.g. memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(s1)+1) or memcmp(..., \"...\", strlen(...)+1)). There are no calls to memcmp in this code. The function contains only fprintf/printf calls, preprocessor conditionals, and a call to MHD_is_feature_supported; none of these are memcmp string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
