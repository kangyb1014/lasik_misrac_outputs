  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code. The code only uses fprintf/printf with string literals (including adjacent string literal concatenation which is performed at compile time), a few preprocessor checks, a call to MHD_is_feature_supported (not a string.h function) and simple integer logic for newline_needed. None of these perform pointer-based string handling (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so there are no places that could violate Rule 21.17 in this fragment."
