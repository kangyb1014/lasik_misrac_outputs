  "explanation": "Rule 17.2 concerns any calls that could (directly or indirectly) invoke the same function. The remaining code fragments are declarations, preprocessor conditionals, simple assignments/bitwise operations (e.g. newline_needed |= ! 0;), and control flow (if, braces). Constants/macros such as MHD_NO and the preprocessor guards are not function calls themselves. No other function-call expressions are present in the provided function, so only the listed call sites need investigation for potential indirect recursion."
