  "explanation": "Other code in the function does not create (or directly affect) controlling expressions that can be invariant for the purposes of MISRA C: the fprintf calls are simple I/O statements and not selection/iteration controlling expressions; the local declaration and initialization int newline_needed = 0; by itself is not a controlling expression (it simply initializes state); the preprocessor #if / #endif blocks control compilation but are compile-time directives rather than C selection/iteration statements covered by Rule 14.3 in the source code \u2014 their presence only matters insofar as they may cause the listed C if-statements/assignments to produce an invariant runtime controlling expression (those cases are already reported). No other if/for/while/do-while/switch controlling expressions appear in the provided function."
