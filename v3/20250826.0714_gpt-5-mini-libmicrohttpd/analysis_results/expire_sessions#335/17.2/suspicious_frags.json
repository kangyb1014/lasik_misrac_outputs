  "explanation": "No other parts of this function perform function calls or invoke function-like macros that could lead to (direct or indirect) recursion. The remaining lines are pointer and integer operations (assignments, structure member accesses, comparisons, arithmetic, and loop control) which do not call functions or dereference function pointers. There are no explicit function-pointer dereferences, no calls to other functions, and no reentrancy constructs in the rest of the code, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2. The function itself contains no direct call to expire_sessions."
