  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Reasoning by control statement:\n- while (NULL != pos): the expression depends on variable pos, which is updated each iteration (pos = next). Therefore it is not invariant.\n- if (now - pos->start > 60 * 60): although now is assigned once before the loop, pos (and thus pos->start) changes each iteration, so the expression can vary and is not invariant.\n- if (NULL == prev) / else prev = pos: the test depends on prev, which is modified in the loop (prev = pos) and so is not invariant.\n- The do-while exception does not apply because there is no do-while in this function.\nGiven these points, there are no controlling expressions that are constant/invariant and thus nothing to investigate for Rule 14.3 in this code fragment."
