  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function and found no use of memcmp or any other standard-library string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp). The code performs time(), pointer/list manipulation and free(), and does not operate on or compare null-terminated strings or character buffers. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and nothing else needs investigation here."
