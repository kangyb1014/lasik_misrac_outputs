  "explanation": "No executed operations in the provided function appear to be dead code. Every assignment and branch in expire_sessions can affect program behaviour: now = time(NULL) is used in the expiration test; prev is initialized to NULL and is needed to handle removal of the head list element; pos = sessions and the while loop drive traversal; next = pos->next is used both to reconnect the list (prev->next = next) when removing an element and to advance pos at the end of the loop; the if/else that updates the list and calls free(pos) clearly affects list contents and memory management; the else branch prev = pos is required for correct linking when elements are not removed; pos = next advances iteration. The comment is not executable code. The function being declared static does not, by itself, imply dead code \u2014 an unused (never-called) function would be unreachable, and per the MISRA note unreachable code is not considered dead code in the sense of Rule 2.2 (dead code is executed but removable without effect). With only this isolated function and no project-wide call graph, there is no evidence here of executed operations whose removal would not change program behaviour, so there are no fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 2.2."
