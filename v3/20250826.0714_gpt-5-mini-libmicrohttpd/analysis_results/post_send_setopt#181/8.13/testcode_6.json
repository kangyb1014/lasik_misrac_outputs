The string literal should be treated as pointing to const char and the function prototype (and/or the _() macro) should accept a const char * to conform to the rule.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified post_send_setopt code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1813.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of post_send_setopt as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of post_send_setopt:\n```c\nstatic void\npost_send_setopt (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  bool plain_send_next,\n                  bool push_data)\n{\n  /* Try to buffer data if not sending the final piece.\n   * Final piece is indicated by push_data == true. */\n  const bool buffer_data = (! push_data);\n\n  if (_MHD_YES == connection->is_nonip)\n    return;\n  if (buffer_data)\n    return; /* Nothing to do after send(). */\n\n#ifndef MHD_USE_MSG_MORE\n  (void) plain_send_next; /* Mute compiler warning */\n#endif /* !
