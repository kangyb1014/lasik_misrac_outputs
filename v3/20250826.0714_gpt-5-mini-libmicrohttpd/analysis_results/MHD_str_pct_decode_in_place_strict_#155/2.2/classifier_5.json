Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ (char *str)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  size_t res;\n  bool broken;\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (str, &broken);\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    res = 0;\n    str[0] = 0;\n  }\n  return res;\n#else  /* !

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The nested casts in the expression are redundant and can be removed without changing behaviour. Specifically, ((unsigned int) h), the surrounding ((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) h)), and similar casts on l do not affect the result because h and l are non\u2011negative small integers (checked earlier) and C integer promotions make the shift and bitwise OR behave the same without those casts. Those cast operations are executed but removable without changing program behaviour, so they constitute dead code and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
