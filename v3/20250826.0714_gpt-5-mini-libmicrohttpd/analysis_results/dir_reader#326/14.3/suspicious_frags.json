  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Details:\n- if (max < 512): depends on the function parameter max \u2014 not invariant.\n- do { e = readdir(dir); ... } while (e->d_name[0] == '.');: the controlling expression depends on e->d_name which is assigned inside the loop by readdir(), so it is not invariant. (If readdir returns NULL the code returns before evaluating the condition.)\n- if (e == NULL) return ...;: depends on the runtime result of readdir(), not invariant.\n- if (0 >= res) and if (max < (size_t) res): both depend on the runtime value res produced by snprintf and on max, not invariant.\n- The (void) pos; statement simply suppresses an unused-parameter warning and is not a controlling expression.\n\nThe allowed exceptions in MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (infinite loops via invariant control or the special do-while constant-false case) do not apply here, and no loop condition is a compile-time or otherwise invariant expression. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
