According to Rule 8.13 it should be declared as 'const struct dirent *e' since the pointed-to object is not modified via 'e'. Therefore the fragment 'e = readdir(dir);' with a non-const 'e' violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the fragment 'e' is only used for read-only access (e->d_name is passed to snprintf) and so, per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type, e.g. 'const struct dirent *e'. Assigning the result of readdir (which returns 'struct dirent *') to a 'const struct dirent *' is an allowed qualification-preserving conversion, so the current declaration 'struct dirent *e' violates the guidance of Rule 8.13. (Note: changing 'e' to const is the straightforward fix; be mindful of any downstream uses that may expect a non-const pointer.)"
