  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could/should point to a const-qualified type: the checks on 'max' and the early returns, the (void) pos ignore, the do/while loop skipping dot entries, the integer 'res' variable, the comparisons of 'res' and size checks, and the final cast/return are unrelated to pointer-target const-qualification. The buffer 'buf' is written to via snprintf, so it must be a modifiable char * (not const). The DIR object is passed to library function readdir which may modify DIR state (so callers must provide a modifiable DIR), but the exact DIR usage is included above for investigation. The snprintf format and use of e->d_name (string data) are captured in the suspicious fragments list for review with respect to const qualification."
