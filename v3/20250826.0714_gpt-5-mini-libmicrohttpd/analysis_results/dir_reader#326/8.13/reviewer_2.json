It could be declared as 'const struct dirent *e;' (assignment from readdir() returning 'struct dirent *' is compatible with a 'const struct dirent *' target). Therefore Rule 8.13 is violated because the pointer is not const-qualified when it could be.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown code the variable e is only used for read-only access (e->d_name) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible; therefore e should be declared as const struct dirent *e. Assigning the result of readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to a const struct dirent * is allowed in C (no cast required). There are no uses in the snippet that require e to be a pointer to non-const, so the code as shown violates Rule 8.13. (One caveat: if elsewhere in the wider module e were passed to functions that require struct dirent * or used to modify the object, const would not be possible \u2014 but based solely on the provided code the report is correct.)"
