  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 the call itself does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Passing &buf_ptr and &da to queue_auth_required_response3_inner is not by itself a bounds violation: buf_ptr is initialized to NULL (so the callee must allocate before writing), digest_setup_zero(&da) initializes the struct, and any use of string.h functions would occur inside the callee. A violation would occur only if the callee performs string operations that access beyond the bounds of the objects passed. Example violation scenarios inside the callee: it calls strcpy(buf_ptr, realm) while buf_ptr is NULL or points to insufficiently allocated memory; or it uses strcpy/memcpy/strcat/etc. to copy into a fixed-size member of da without checking the source length (e.g. copying a longer realm into a char array member of da). Those callee behaviors would breach Rule 21.17, but the shown call site does not itself violate the rule."
