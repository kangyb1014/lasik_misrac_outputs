  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is 'if (NULL != buf_ptr)' which depends on the runtime value of buf_ptr and therefore is not a constant/invariant expression. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant controlling expressions, and no infinite-loop patterns or do-while with an integer constant expression present. Hence there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
