  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they are not function calls that could cause direct or indirect recursion. Specifically: - Declarations (struct DigestAlgorithm da; char *buf_ptr; enum MHD_Result ret;) and the function signature do not invoke any functions. - The assignment buf_ptr = NULL; is a plain value assignment and cannot trigger a call. - The return ret; statement simply returns the result and does not call any function. - There are no other function calls in the snippet besides the four listed above. Therefore only the explicit function calls (queue_auth_required_response3_inner, digest_setup_zero, digest_deinit, and the call to free guarded by the NULL check) need investigation to determine whether any of them (directly or indirectly) call back into MHD_queue_auth_required_response3; everything else cannot introduce recursion and can be excluded from further inspection."
