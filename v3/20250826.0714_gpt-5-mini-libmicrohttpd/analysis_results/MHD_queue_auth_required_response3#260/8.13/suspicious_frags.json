  "explanation": "Other pointer-bearing fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: realm, opaque, and domain are already const-qualified (const char *), so they conform; the DigestAlgorithm variable is passed by address to digest_setup_zero(&da) and digest_deinit(&da) which must modify it, so a non-const pointee type is appropriate; the call-site arguments that are non-pointer types (enums, ints) are not relevant to this rule; return value and local enum/primitive variables are not pointer types and need not be considered. Freeing buf_ptr and the use of &da are consistent with modification semantics and therefore not candidates for changing the pointee to const."
