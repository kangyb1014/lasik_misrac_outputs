  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (the conditions of if/while/for/do-while). The fragments listed above are all controlling expressions in this function and therefore should be investigated for possible invariance. Other parts of the function are not controlling expressions (declarations: const uint64_t timeout = c->connection_timeout_ms; uint64_t now; uint64_t since_actv; the assignments now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter(); since_actv = now - c->last_activity; return true/false statements; preprocessor blocks and calls to MHD_DLOG) and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3 \u2014 they cannot themselves be invariant controlling expressions and do not need separate investigation under this rule."
