  "explanation": "The function mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_ has no parameters (prototype uses void), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable. All assignments in the function target local variables (ret and value) rather than parameters. Calls to sysconf() store their return into the local variable value; the pointer-related caveat in the rule is also irrelevant because no pointer parameters are present. Conditional compilation and casts operate on local variables and constants only. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
