  "explanation": "I marked all conditional-compilation regions and the runtime checks inside them as suspicious because unreachable-code concerns most commonly arise from preprocessor exclusions or logic that makes subsequent statements never executed. The outer #if..#endif block may be entirely omitted depending on macro definitions, so that whole region needs review. Each inner #ifdef block is only present under specific macro configurations and thus should be inspected for possible unconditional exclusion or unintended dead paths. The two return paths inside the conditional region (the check for non-positive value and the overflow check) are potential early exits that could be unreachable under some configurations or logic flows and therefore warrant inspection. Other fragments were not reported because they are simple, clearly reachable statements irrespective of the preprocessor/macros: the function prologue/epilogue (the initial \"int ret = -1;\" and the final \"return ret;\") are straightforward and not candidates for being unreachable, and there are no other independent statements outside the conditional region that could be dead code."
