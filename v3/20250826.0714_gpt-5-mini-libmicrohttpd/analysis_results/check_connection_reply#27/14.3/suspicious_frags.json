  "explanation": "No other controlling expressions exist in the function body that could be invariant. The remaining statements are declarations, preprocessor directives (#ifdef/#else/#endif), and explicit casts to void to suppress warnings; none introduce if/while/do-while/switch controlling expressions. The two if-statements flagged read structure members (c->rp.props.use_reply_body_headers, r->total_size, r->flags_auto) which are not compile-time constants in the source shown, so other conditional expressions in the file are not candidates for MISRA Rule 14.3. The mhd_assert call is flagged because its macro expansion may introduce a controlling expression; other macro usages in this snippet do not introduce additional visible controlling expressions to investigate."
