  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is a call to the translation macro/function _() with a string literal. There is no call to check_connection_reply (neither direct nor indirect) in this fragment, so it does not introduce recursion. (Only if _ were somehow defined to call check_connection_reply would recursion occur, but that is not the typical meaning of _ and not evident from the fragment.)"
