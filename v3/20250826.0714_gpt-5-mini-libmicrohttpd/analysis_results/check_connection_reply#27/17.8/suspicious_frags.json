  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the function parameter itself (connection). The function only: - copies the parameter value into a local const pointer (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;) which does not change the parameter variable; - creates a local const pointer to a response (struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;) and only reads fields via c and r; - uses (void) c and (void) r to silence warnings; - calls/macros (mhd_assert, MHD_DLOG) that only read fields (e.g. c->rp.props.set, r->total_size, r->flags_auto, c->daemon, c->rp.responseCode). There are no assignments to connection (no rebinds like connection = ...), no increments/decrements of the parameter, and no operations that modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
