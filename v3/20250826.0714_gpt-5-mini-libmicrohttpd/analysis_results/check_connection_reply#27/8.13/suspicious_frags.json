  "explanation": "Only these fragments introduce pointer types that could reasonably be const-qualified. The function parameter and the two local pointer aliases are the only pointer declarations in the function; the rest of the code consists of assertions, conditional checks, logging calls, and (void) casts to silence unused-variable warnings \u2014 none of which declare additional pointers or demonstrate modifications that would prevent adding const to the pointed-to types. Therefore other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
