  "scenario": "The function parameter 'connection' is declared as struct MHD_Connection *connection but the function only reads fields and does not modify the pointed object. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be const-qualified when possible. A corrected signature would be: static void check_connection_reply(const struct MHD_Connection *connection) and the local alias: const struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; (the existing r assignment can remain as struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response)."
