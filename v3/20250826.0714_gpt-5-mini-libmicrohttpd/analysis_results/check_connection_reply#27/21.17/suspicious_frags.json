  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code fragment. The function only performs pointer dereferences (c->rp.response, c->rp.props.*, r->total_size, r->flags_auto), integer/flag checks, logging via MHD_DLOG and uses the localization macro _(...). The casts to (void) are only to mute compiler warnings. None of these operations invoke the string-handling functions governed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so there are no direct string.h usages in this snippet to investigate. (If the logging or localization macros expand elsewhere to calls into string.h, that expansion is outside the provided code and would need separate inspection \u2014 but within this snippet there are no string.h function calls.)"
