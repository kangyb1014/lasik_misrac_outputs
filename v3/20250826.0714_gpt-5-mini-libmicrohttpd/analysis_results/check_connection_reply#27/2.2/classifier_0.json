Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_connection_reply:\n```c\nstatic void\ncheck_connection_reply (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;  /**< a short alias */\n\n  mhd_assert (c->rp.props.set);\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if ( (! c->rp.props.use_reply_body_headers) &&\n       (0 != r->total_size) )\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n              _ (\"This reply with response code %u cannot use reply body. \"\n                 \"Non-empty response body is ignored and not used.\\n\"),\n              (unsigned) (c->rp.responseCode));\n  }\n  if ( (! c->rp.props.use_reply_body_headers) &&\n       (0 != (r->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH)) )\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n              _ (\"This reply with response code %u cannot use reply body. \"\n                 \"Application defined \\\"Content-Length\\\" header violates\"\n                 \"HTTP specification.\\n\"),\n              (unsigned) (c->rp.responseCode));\n  }\n#else\n  (void) c; /* Mute compiler warning */\n  (void) r; /* Mute compiler warning */\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void) r; /* Mute compiler warning */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement '(void) r;' is a no-op used solely to silence an unused-variable compiler warning. It has no effect on program semantics or timing; removing it does not change program behaviour, therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
