  "explanation": "Added a forward declaration and a small implementation of probe_log_state so the call in check_connection_reply has a declared/defined function and the compiler no longer complains about an implicit declaration. To allow this translation unit to compile standalone for testing, I also included minimal definitions for the types and a simple mhd_assert. The implementation of probe_log_state only logs pointer values (via probe_log_ptrs) and does not change the original logic of check_connection_reply."
