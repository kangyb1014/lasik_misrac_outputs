  "explanation": "Other fragments do not appear to present unreachable-code concerns and therefore need not be investigated: - The local alias declarations (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; and struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;) are simple initializations and do not introduce unreachable code. - There are no return statements, unconditional gotos, infinite loops, or code following an unconditional abort/exit within this function except for the mhd_assert macro (which is listed above because its expansion could change control flow). - The conditional compilation boundary (the #ifdef/#else/#endif) itself is normal and only controls whether logging or the (void) casts are compiled; the (void) casts are legitimate to suppress unused-variable warnings when logging is omitted and are included above for inspection. - There are no constant boolean expressions in plain code (e.g., if (0) or if (1)) that would make blocks unconditionally unreachable. Therefore, apart from the listed fragments (assert, the two logging branches and the no-logging (void) casts), no other parts of this function warrant investigation for potential unreachable code."
