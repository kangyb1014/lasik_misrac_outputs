  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in normal builds. The fragment is inside #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES and contains runtime conditions (c->rp.props.use_reply_body_headers and r->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH) so it can be executed when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined and the runtime tests evaluate true. It is therefore not inherently unreachable. A violation would occur only in a specific build/configuration where the code is compiled but provably never executed \u2014 e.g. if HAVE_MESSAGES is defined but both test operands are compile-time constants that make the whole if condition always false (or preceding code guarantees the condition can never be true), resulting in dead (unreachable) compiled code."
