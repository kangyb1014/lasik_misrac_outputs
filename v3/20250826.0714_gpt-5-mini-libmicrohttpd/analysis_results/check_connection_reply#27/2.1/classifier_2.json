  "scenario": "The statement mhd_assert(c->rp.props.set); by itself is not unreachable and therefore does not violate Rule 2.1. It is a runtime check (typically a macro that tests the expression and aborts only on failure), so control can reach and execute it. A concrete violation scenario would exist only if mhd_assert were defined such that it unconditionally does not return (for example, it expands to an unconditional call to a non-returning function like abort() or a noreturn assertion handler regardless of the expression). In that case, any code following the call would be unreachable, which would violate Rule 2.1."
