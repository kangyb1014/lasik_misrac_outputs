  "explanation": "Only calls to string-handling functions from <string.h> are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code contains multiple strcmp calls (listed above) and these should be investigated to ensure argv[i] is a valid, non-NULL, null-terminated object and that strcmp will not read beyond its bounds. Other fragments do not require investigation for Rule 21.17: the loop index bounds (i < (unsigned int) argc) restrict accesses to argv[0..argc-1]; sscanf, fprintf and printf are I/O functions from <stdio.h>, not <string.h>, and so are outside the scope of this rule; there are no uses of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn in the function. Therefore only the strcmp call sites need further review for this specific MISRA requirement."
