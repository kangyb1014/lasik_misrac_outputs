  "explanation": "No code fragments that call check_params (directly or indirectly) were found in the provided function. I inspected all function calls and constructs inside check_params: strcmp, sscanf, fprintf, and printf are standard library calls and do not (and cannot in normal usage) call back into check_params. There are no function-pointer invocations, callbacks, macro expansions, or assignments to function pointers in this fragment that could enable indirect recursion. The function is self-contained: it iterates over argv, updates global flags, and returns; it does not call any other user-defined functions from the same translation unit that might in turn call check_params. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 in this code."
