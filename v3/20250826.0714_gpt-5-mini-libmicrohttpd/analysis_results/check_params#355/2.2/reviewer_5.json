In that situation the write is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour (i.e. true dead code). The agent points to the assignment allow_rfc2069 = !0 in check_params and claims it is dead. That claim is speculative: whether that write is dead depends on the whole project (is allow_rfc2069 ever read, or is it always overwritten before any read?). From the single function shown you cannot demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation. To prove the rule is violated you must show, across the entire project, that the write is executed and that removing it would not change behaviour (for example, that allow_rfc2069 is never read or is unconditionally reset before any read). If such a whole-project analysis finds no reads (or guaranteed overwrite), then the agent\u2019s scenario would indeed indicate a Rule 2.2 violation. But as presented, the report does not provide that proof, so it is not correct to claim a definite violation based solely on this code snippet."
