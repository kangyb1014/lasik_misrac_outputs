Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count:\n```c\nint\nmhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count (void)\n{\n  int res;\n\n  /* Try specialised APIs first */\n  res = mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ ();\n  if (0 < res)\n    return res;\n\n  /* Try sysctl*().

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call assigns to 'res' and the value is subsequently tested in the platform-specific conditionals that follow (both the !(__linux__ || __GLIBC__) and the __linux__/__GLIBC__ branches), influencing return decisions and further calls. Removing the assignment (or the call) would change program behaviour, so this is not dead code."
