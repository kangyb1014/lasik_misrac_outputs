  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect self-calls. The listed fragments are all call sites from mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count to other helper functions; any of those helpers could (directly or indirectly) call back into mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count, creating indirect recursion \u2014 so each call site must be examined. Other parts of the function (variable declarations, integer comparisons like `if (0 < res)`, return statements returning a primitive value, comments, and preprocessor conditionals) do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves introduce direct or indirect recursion; they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 in this context."
