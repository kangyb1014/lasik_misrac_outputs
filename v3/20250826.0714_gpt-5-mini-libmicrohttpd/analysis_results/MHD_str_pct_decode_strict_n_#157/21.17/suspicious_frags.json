  "explanation": "No calls to <string.h> string-handling functions are present in this function, so Rule 21.17 (which concerns use of those standard library functions) does not directly apply. Furthermore, all direct indexed accesses into the input buffer pct_encoded are guarded by the loop condition (while (r < pct_encoded_len)) and by explicit checks before consuming percent-encoded hex pairs (if (2 > pct_encoded_len - r) return 0). Writes into decoded are protected either by the initial conservative check (if (buf_size >= pct_encoded_len) \u2014 decoded length cannot exceed encoded length) or by the per-iteration check (if (w >= buf_size) return 0) in the other branch. The increments of r and w are consistent with the parsing logic (the inner ++r usages advance over the two hex digits and the loop-end ++r advances past the third character), so there are no apparent indexed accesses that can run beyond the provided buffer bounds. For these reasons, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.17 in this function."
