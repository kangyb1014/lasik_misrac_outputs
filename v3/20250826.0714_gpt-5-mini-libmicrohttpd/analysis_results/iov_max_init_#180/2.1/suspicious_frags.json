  "explanation": "The remaining code (the sysconf call, the if (res >= 0) branch and the direct assignment mhd_iov_max_ = (unsigned long) res;) should not be investigated for unreachable-code under MISRA Rule 2.1 because they are conditioned on the runtime result of sysconf and contain no control flow that statically makes them unreachable (no returns, breaks, gotos or other constructs that render subsequent statements dead). The only potential unreachable-code concerns arise from the compile-time conditional alternatives and the enclosing else block (listed above), so those are the fragments flagged for investigation."
