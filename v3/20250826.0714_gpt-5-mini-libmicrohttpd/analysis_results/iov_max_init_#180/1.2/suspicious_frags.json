  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in this snippet. The code uses only standard C constructs (static function, long, cast to unsigned long, preprocessor #if/#else/#endif, and comments). There are no compiler-specific tokens or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions, GCC/Clang pragmas, or other vendor-specific keywords. The use of sysconf() and _SC_IOV_MAX and the IOV_MAX macro are POSIX/implementation-provided API/macros, not language/compiler extensions per se; if POSIX dependency is a concern that is a separate portability issue, but it does not constitute a compiler language extension under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Therefore there are no fragments to flag for Rule 1.2."
