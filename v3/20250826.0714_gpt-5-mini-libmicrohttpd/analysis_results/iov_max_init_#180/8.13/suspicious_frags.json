  "explanation": "No pointer usage is present in the provided code fragment. All variables are scalar types (long, unsigned long); sysconf returns a long (scalar), IOV_MAX is a macro integer constant, and mhd_iov_max_ is assigned scalar values. There are no pointer declarations, no pointer parameters, no address-of (&) or dereference (*) operations, and no casts to or from pointer types. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to const-qualified type when possible) is not applicable and there are no code fragments to investigate for this rule."
