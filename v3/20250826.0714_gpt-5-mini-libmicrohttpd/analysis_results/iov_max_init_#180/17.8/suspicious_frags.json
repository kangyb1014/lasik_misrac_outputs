  "explanation": "The function iov_max_init_ has no parameters (signature: static void iov_max_init_ (void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not applicable. The only assignments are to a local variable (res) and to a global/static object (mhd_iov_max_), neither of which are function parameters. There are no pointer parameters in this function, so the pointer-specific part of the rule is also irrelevant. Preprocessor conditional assignments (IOV_MAX or literal 8) likewise do not involve modifying parameters. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
