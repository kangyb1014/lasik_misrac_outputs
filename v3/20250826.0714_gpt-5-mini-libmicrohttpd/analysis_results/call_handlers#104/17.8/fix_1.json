  "explanation": "Replaced direct uses of con->tls_read_ready (which may not exist in the struct) with a local tls_read_ready variable. The local variable is false by default and, when HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined, it is populated from con->tls_read_ready inside the HTTPS_SUPPORT guarded code (so compilation will succeed whether the member exists in the real build or not). Also added minimal type and function declarations and necessary headers so this translation unit compiles. No mock function bodies were added and the original logic and flow of call_handlers were preserved."
