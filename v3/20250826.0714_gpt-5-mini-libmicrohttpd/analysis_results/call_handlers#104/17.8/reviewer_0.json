  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters (the pointer exception only applies to objects pointed to by pointer parameters). In the code, under #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT the statement\n  if (con->tls_read_ready)\n    read_ready = true;\nassigns to the by-value parameter read_ready, which modifies the parameter object and therefore violates Rule 17.8. A typical fix is to introduce a local variable (e.g. bool local_read_ready = read_ready;) and modify that instead, or otherwise avoid assigning to the parameter."
