True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert call contains a function call MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_valid_ID_(con->tid) which is used only for diagnostic checking. If mhd_assert is a macro that is compiled out in production (e.g. defined to ((void)0)) or if the checked function has no side effects, then the call is an operation that can be removed without changing program behaviour (except diagnostics). In builds where the assertion is evaluated the function call is executed but its removal would not affect normal program behaviour, so this constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct as stated. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether these mhd_assert lines constitute dead code depends on the project build and the semantics of the asserted expression, so you cannot conclude a violation from the snippet alone:\n\n- If mhd_assert is compiled out (so the expression is not evaluated), then the function call is not executed at all. Dead code under Rule 2.2 must be executed; code that is removed by conditional compilation is not \"dead code\" under the rule because it is not executed in that build.\n- If mhd_assert is active, the assertion and its operand do affect program behaviour (diagnostics, possible abort on failure, and potentially timing or logging). Removing the call could therefore change behaviour (diagnostic behaviour, error detection, or timing), so the operation would not meet the definition of dead code.\n- The asserted function may also have side effects (logging, instrumentation) that change behaviour if removed. Without project-wide knowledge you cannot assume it has no side effects.\n\nMISRA 2.2 must be judged at project level with knowledge of build configurations and the actual definition/semantics of mhd_assert and the called function. Given the available information, Agent A's claim that these calls violate Rule 2.2 is not justified."
