  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. The function definition, enum declarations, if/else chain, macro invocations (MHD_PANIC, _MHD_EXTERN, _(...)), and the return statement all use standard C constructs. There is no inline assembly, no GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __declspec syntax, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({: ... :}), no nested functions, no variable-length arrays, no designated initializer extensions, and no other vendor-specific keywords visible in this snippet. \n\nNotes on potentially suspicious tokens that do not indicate language extensions here:\n- _MHD_EXTERN is a macro identifier; the source here does not show any compiler-specific extension syntax. Whether it expands to a compiler-specific attribute cannot be determined from this fragment, so it should not be flagged as a language-extension usage based only on its name.\n- The use of identifiers beginning with an underscore (for example _MHD_EXTERN or the _(...) gettext-like macro) is permitted in C source code (though some forms are reserved by the implementation). Reservation of identifiers is a separate concern from Rule 1.2 (language extensions) and is not evidence of a compiler extension in this fragment.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments in this snippet explicitly use language extensions that are documented as compiler extensions and need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
