  "explanation": "I have flagged the mapping from 'algo' to 'algo3' (including the else branch) and the final call that consumes 'algo3'. Other parts of the function do not appear to contain dead code: the function signature and parameters are required for the wrapper behavior; the variable 'algo3' is assigned in the conditional branches and subsequently used in the return call (so those assignments are not removable without changing behavior); the return statement forwards values to the next API and thus cannot be removed without changing program behavior. There is no unreachable code in the snippet (no code after a guaranteed non-return), and no obvious redundant assignments or initializations elsewhere in the function. Therefore only the listed fragments warrant further investigation for potential dead-code issues."
