True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes a non-const pointer 'connection' to has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer. If that function only inspects fields of the connection (does not modify it), its parameter should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *' (or equivalent const-qualified pointer). In that case the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer points to a non-const-qualified type when a const qualification is possible. If, however, has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer intentionally modifies the connection, then no violation occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not provably correct from the snippet alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointee is not modified. That requirement is expressed in the declaration/definition of the function that takes the pointer (the prototype/parameter type), not in the caller code shown here.\n\nAgent A's scenario is plausible: if has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer only reads fields of the connection and does not modify it, then that function\u2019s parameter should be declared as const struct MHD_Connection * and the codebase would be violating Rule 8.13 (the violation would be in the function declaration/definition, not the call site). However, the snippet provided does not include the prototype or implementation of has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, so we cannot determine whether its parameter could be const.\n\nConclusion: the claim may be correct if has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer does not modify connection (in which case its parameter should be const). But based solely on the shown MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info code, there is no demonstrated violation. To decide definitively you must inspect the declaration/definition of has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer (and any other functions taking struct MHD_Connection *): if they do not modify the object, change their parameter types to const struct MHD_Connection * to comply with Rule 8.13."
