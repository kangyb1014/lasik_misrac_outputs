  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_panic_func:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN void\nMHD_set_panic_func (MHD_PanicCallback cb,\n                    void *cls)\n{\n  if ((MHD_PanicCallback) NULL != cb)\n    mhd_panic = cb;\n  else\n    mhd_panic = &mhd_panic_std;\n\n  mhd_panic_cls = cls;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_panic = &mhd_panic_std;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment mhd_panic = &mhd_panic_std; executes when cb is NULL to install the default panic handler. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour because subsequent calls through mhd_panic would use whatever prior value it had (or remain uninitialized). Thus the operation is not dead code."
