  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The code only performs function-pointer and void*-pointer assignments and a null check: setting mhd_panic to cb or to &mhd_panic_std and storing mhd_panic_cls = cls. There are no buffer or array accesses, no pointer arithmetic, and no use of string handling APIs that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. The cast to (MHD_PanicCallback) NULL is only used for comparison and does not invoke any string operation. Indirect uses of the stored callback (e.g., if that callback later manipulates strings) are outside the scope of this function and must be checked at their call sites, not here."
