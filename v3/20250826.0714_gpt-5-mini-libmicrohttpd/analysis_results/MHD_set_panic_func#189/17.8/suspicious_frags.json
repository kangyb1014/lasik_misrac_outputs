  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are `cb` and `cls` and neither is assigned to or otherwise modified in the body. The code only reads `cb` (compares it to NULL) and assigns its value to the global `mhd_panic`, and assigns `cls` to the global `mhd_panic_cls`. Assigning a pointer parameter\u2019s value to a global does not modify the parameter itself; modifying the object pointed to would be permitted, but no such modification occurs here. The cast of NULL for the comparison and assigning `&mhd_panic_std` to the global are also reads/assignments that do not modify the parameters. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
