  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of resume_suspended_connections:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nresume_suspended_connections (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev = NULL;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  const bool used_thr_p_c = (0 != (daemon->options\n                                   & MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION));\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "scenario": "The fragment is a macro/function call (DLL_insert(daemon->cleanup_head, daemon->cleanup_tail, pos)); as shown it does not contain a for statement, so it cannot by itself violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2. Caveat: if DLL_insert is a macro that expands to a for statement, the expansion must be inspected. A violation would occur if the expanded for loop has more than one loop counter, modifies the loop counter in the loop body, uses objects in the second/third clause that are also modified in the body, or otherwise fails the three clause requirements of Rule 14.2 (e.g. non-empty first clause that does not initialize the single loop counter, persistent side effects in the second clause, or the third clause modifying objects other than the loop counter)."
