  "explanation": "I found no syntactically unreachable code in the submitted function. Reasoning by inspection:\n- There are no return, goto, longjmp, abort, or similar transfer statements that would make any subsequent statements unreachable.\n- There are no conditional constructs (if/else with constant-false condition, #if 0, or switch with unreachable case labels) that would render code unreachable.\n- The four sequential for-loops (i = 0..15, i = 16..79, i = 0..19, i = 20..39, i = 40..59, i = 60..79) are all standard bounded loops with well-defined ranges; none is infinite, and each loop body is reachable when the loop executes.\n- Declarations and assignments (K[], W[], A..E, temp) are all used later in the function; there are no dead assignments followed by an unconditional return that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n- The final updates to context->intermediate_hash[] and message_block_index = 0 are reachable at the end of the function.\n\nNote: I did not flag any fragments because there is no clear unreachable code within this function as presented. If external definitions (for example, SHA1CircularShift implemented via a macro that expands to an unconditional jump/return, or conditional compilation around parts of the function) exist elsewhere, those could introduce unreachable code; such cases require inspecting those external definitions or build configuration."
