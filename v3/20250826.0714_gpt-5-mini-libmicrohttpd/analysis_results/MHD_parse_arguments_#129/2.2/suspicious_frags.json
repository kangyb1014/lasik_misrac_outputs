  "explanation": "I focused on all executed operations that (a) mutate the parsed input buffer (strchr assignments, writes of '\\0', pointer increments, args = amper), (b) perform unescaping (MHD_unescape_plus calls), (c) invoke the unescape callback (key_len/value_len = daemon->unescape_callback...), and (d) invoke the provided iterator callback (if (MHD_NO == cb (...)) return MHD_NO). These are the statements whose removal or no-op-ification could plausibly not change observable behaviour (and therefore deserve investigation for possible dead code). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: variable declarations (e.g. size_t key_len/value_len; struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = ...;) are not executable operations and so cannot be \"dead code\" per the rule; the while-loop condition and return MHD_YES are control-flow constructs required for function semantics; comments and whitespace are non-executable; and simple checks like the top-level loop guard (NULL != args && args[0] != '\\0') are necessary to avoid dereferencing NULL or empty strings. I have therefore listed all executed assignments, buffer mutations, unescape operations, callback invocations and control-flow statements (break/continue) that should be investigated for potential dead code. No other executable fragments in this function appear removable without affecting behavior."
