  "explanation": "I examined the entire function for compiler-specific language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang attributes like __attribute__((...)), statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, inline asm, builtin/__builtin_*, designated initializers with compiler-specific forms, zero-length arrays, anonymous structs/unions as extensions, token-pasting quirks, or other non-standard tokens such as __extension__ or compiler-specific keywords). The code only uses standard C constructs and standard library functions (enum, struct pointers, char*, size_t, NULL, strchr, plain function-pointer callback invocation, standard control flow and pointer operations). There are no uses of compiler-specific keywords, builtins, attributes, or other explicit language extensions documented by compilers. Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
