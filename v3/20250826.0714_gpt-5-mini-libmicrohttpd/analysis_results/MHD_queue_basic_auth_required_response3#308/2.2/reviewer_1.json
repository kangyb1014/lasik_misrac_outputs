True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert call is a pure runtime check with no side-effects (common when assert-like macros only evaluate a condition and call abort/report on failure). If mhd_assert is implemented so that the test has no observable side-effects (and in normal operation the condition is always true), then the assertion statement is an operation that can be removed without changing program behaviour \u2014 i.e. it is dead code. For example, if mhd_assert expands to a no-op in some build configurations or only evaluates a side-effect-free condition, removing this statement will not affect program behaviour, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The mhd_assert calls are not provably dead code. Rule 2.2 forbids code that is executed but can be removed without changing program behaviour; to show a violation you must demonstrate that the operation can be removed in all project builds and in all executions without changing behaviour. The agent's argument depends on an assumption that mhd_assert is a side\u2011effect\u2011free, always\u2011true check (or that it is compiled out everywhere). Neither is established by the snippet:\n\n- mhd_assert is typically an assertion macro that can have observable side effects (logging, diagnostics, abort) when the condition fails. Removing such checks would change behaviour in fault cases, so they are not dead. \n- If mhd_assert is compiled out (expands to nothing) in some build, then there is no executed operation in that build to be classified as dead; absence in a build does not prove the project contains executed, removable operations.\n- Whether an operation is dead is a whole\u2011program property; you cannot conclude deadness from a local view unless the condition and macro semantics are provably inert in all builds and runs (which is not shown).\n\nTherefore the presence of mhd_assert calls in this function does not by itself violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2."
