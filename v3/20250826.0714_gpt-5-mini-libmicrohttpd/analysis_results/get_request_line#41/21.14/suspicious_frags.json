  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other raw byte-comparison of C strings) appears in this function. The fragment contains only pointer/length checks, pointer comparisons, calls to helper functions, and assertions. Specifically:\n- There are no calls to memcmp in the provided code.\n- There are no other standard-library string-comparison calls (strcmp, strncmp, etc.) in this snippet.\n- All comparisons involving strings/buffers are pointer/length arithmetic or NULL checks (e.g. checks of c->rq.version, c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos, c->rq.url_len), not byte-wise comparisons.\n\nIf code in the externally-called functions (transmit_error_response_static, send_redirect_fixed_rq_target, process_request_target, or get_request_line_inner) should be reviewed, those implementations are not part of this fragment and must be inspected separately for memcmp usage. Based solely on the provided get_request_line implementation, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
