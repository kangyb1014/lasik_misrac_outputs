If struct members are declared like\n  char *version;\n  char *read_buffer;\nthen Rule 8.13 is violated because these pointers should be const-qualified (e.g. const char *version; const char *read_buffer;) since the object is not modified here. Change the member types to point to const-qualified types to comply.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim cannot be proven from the supplied fragment. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, but whether the rule is violated depends on the declarations and all uses of those members (in particular whether any code ever writes through or needs a non-const pointer). The snippet only reads via c->rq.version and c->read_buffer, but other translation-unit code may modify data via those pointers or pass them to APIs that expect non-const char*. Without the struct member declarations and a scan of all uses, you cannot conclude a violation. \n\nRecommendation: inspect the declarations of c->rq.version and c->read_buffer and search the codebase for any writes (dereferences used as lvalues) or non-const API calls that require char*. If neither writes nor non-const APIs exist, change the members to const char * (and adjust prototypes) to satisfy Rule 8.13. Otherwise no change is safe. Also watch for casts that deliberately drop const qualification \u2014 those can hide violations."
