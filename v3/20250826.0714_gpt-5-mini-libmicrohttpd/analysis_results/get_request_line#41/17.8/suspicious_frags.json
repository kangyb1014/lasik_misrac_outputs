  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is the pointer variable c; there are no assignments to or modifications of the pointer itself (no occurrences of \"c = ...\", \"c++\", \"c += ...\", or similar). All uses modify the object pointed to (e.g. c->rq.http_ver = ..., c->state = ..., checks and assignments to c->rq.* and c->read_buffer), which is permitted by Rule 17.8. Pointer arithmetic in the expression (c->rq.version - c->read_buffer) only computes an offset and does not modify the parameter. Function calls that receive c may modify the pointed-to object but do not modify the pointer parameter within this function. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
