Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_request_line:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_request_line (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const int discp_lvl = c->daemon->client_discipline;\n  /* Parse whitespace in URI, special parsing of the request line */\n  const bool wsp_in_uri = (0 >= discp_lvl);\n  /* Keep whitespace in URI, give app URI with whitespace instead of\n     automatic redirect to fixed URI */\n  const bool wsp_in_uri_keep = (-2 >= discp_lvl);\n\n  if (! get_request_line_inner (c))\n  {\n    /* End of the request line has not been found yet */\n    mhd_assert ((! wsp_in_uri) || NULL == c->rq.version);\n    if ((NULL != c->rq.version) &&\n        (HTTP_VER_LEN <\n         (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos\n          - (size_t) (c->rq.version - c->read_buffer))))\n    {\n      c->rq.http_ver = MHD_HTTP_VER_INVALID;\n      transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                      MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST,\n                                      REQUEST_MALFORMED);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n  if (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING < c->state)\n    return true; /* Error in the request */\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == c->rq.url);\n  mhd_assert (0 == c->rq.url_len);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n  if (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri)\n  {\n    if (! wsp_in_uri)\n    {\n      transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                      MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST,\n                                      RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n    if (! wsp_in_uri_keep)\n    {\n      send_redirect_fixed_rq_target (c);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n  }\n  if (! process_request_target (c))\n    return true; /* Error in processing */\n\n  c->state = MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVED;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING < c->state)\n    return true; /* Error in the request */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-statement is a runtime guard that returns an error when c->state has already progressed past MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING. This affects program behaviour if such a state occurs (for example due to prior processing or concurrent state changes), so removal would change behaviour. Unreachable code is not the same as dead code; here the check cannot be assumed never-to-execute, therefore it is not dead code."
