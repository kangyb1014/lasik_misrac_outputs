  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_request_line:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_request_line (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const int discp_lvl = c->daemon->client_discipline;\n  /* Parse whitespace in URI, special parsing of the request line */\n  const bool wsp_in_uri = (0 >= discp_lvl);\n  /* Keep whitespace in URI, give app URI with whitespace instead of\n     automatic redirect to fixed URI */\n  const bool wsp_in_uri_keep = (-2 >= discp_lvl);\n\n  if (! get_request_line_inner (c))\n  {\n    /* End of the request line has not been found yet */\n    mhd_assert ((! wsp_in_uri) || NULL == c->rq.version);\n    if ((NULL != c->rq.version) &&\n        (HTTP_VER_LEN <\n         (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos\n          - (size_t) (c->rq.version - c->read_buffer))))\n    {\n      c->rq.http_ver = MHD_HTTP_VER_INVALID;\n      transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                      MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST,\n                                      REQUEST_MALFORMED);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n  if (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING < c->state)\n    return true; /* Error in the request */\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == c->rq.url);\n  mhd_assert (0 == c->rq.url_len);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n  if (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri)\n  {\n    if (! wsp_in_uri)\n    {\n      transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                      MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST,\n                                      RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n    if (! wsp_in_uri_keep)\n    {\n      send_redirect_fixed_rq_target (c);\n      return true; /* Error in the request */\n    }\n  }\n  if (! process_request_target (c))\n    return true; /* Error in processing */\n\n  c->state = MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVED;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == c->rq.url);\n  mhd_assert (0 == c->rq.url_len);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The lines are mhd_assert checks of internal invariants. Typically mhd_assert is a diagnostic macro that either expands to a runtime check (which alters behaviour on failure) or to a no-op in production builds. In the former case removal would change behaviour when an invariant is violated; in the latter case the statements are not executed at all. Therefore these assertions do not constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
