  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: static function scope, const and int types, Boolean usage (bool/true/false \u2014 part of standard C99 via <stdbool.h>), pointer arithmetic and casts, standard control flow (if/return), and macro-like identifiers (MHD_*, mhd_assert) that are ordinary identifiers in user code. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang attributes (__attribute__), typeof, statement expressions ({...}), nested functions, inline assembler, labels-as-values, variadic-macros beyond standard, extended integer types, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
