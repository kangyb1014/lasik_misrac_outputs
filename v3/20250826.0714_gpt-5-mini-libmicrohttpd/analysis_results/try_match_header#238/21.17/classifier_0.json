  "scenario": "If MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ compares up to prefix_len characters from its pointer arguments, calling it with prefix_len larger than the number of characters remaining in line can cause reads beyond the end of the object pointed to by line. For example, if line contains a shorter (null-terminated) string than prefix_len, the call may access bytes past the terminating null (out-of-bounds) \u2014 violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 unless MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ itself guards against such reads."
