  "scenario": "As written this call is not inherently in violation because strdup(&line[prefix_len]) is executed only after MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ returned true, which implies the prefix_len bytes starting at 'line' exist and the remainder of the string is NUL-terminated so strdup will not read past the object. A violation scenario would occur if prefix_len is greater than the remaining length of 'line' (or if MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is faulty and returns true despite line being shorter); in that case &line[prefix_len] would point outside the bounds (or not to a NUL-terminated string) and strdup would read beyond the object bounds."
