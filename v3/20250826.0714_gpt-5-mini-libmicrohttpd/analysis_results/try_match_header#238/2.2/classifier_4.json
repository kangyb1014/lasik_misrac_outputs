  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of try_match_header:\n```c\nstatic int\ntry_match_header (const char *prefix,\n                  size_t prefix_len,\n                  char *line,\n                  char **suffix)\n{\n  if (NULL != *suffix)\n    return MHD_NO;\n  while (0 != *line)\n  {\n    if (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (prefix,\n                                   line,\n                                   prefix_len))\n    {\n      *suffix = strdup (&line[prefix_len]);\n      return MHD_YES;\n    }\n    ++line;\n  }\n  return MHD_NO;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_NO;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The final \"return MHD_NO;\" is executed when *suffix is NULL and the loop finishes without finding the prefix (i.e. no match). Removing it would alter program behaviour (and lead to undefined behaviour by falling off a non-void function), so it is not dead code."
