The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not appear to be candidates for dead code and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the function header and parameter declarations define the interface and are not executable code that could be dead; the loop condition (while (0 != *line)) and the increment (++line) are required to iterate through the input string and affect control flow (not removable without changing behaviour); the call expression MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_(prefix, line, prefix_len) is an observable operation that influences whether the function returns early and thus is not dead; the block/brace structure is part of normal control flow. No initializations are present that would be mistaken for dead assignments. The listed fragments are the only parts that could plausibly be unnecessary at runtime and therefore warrant further inspection."
