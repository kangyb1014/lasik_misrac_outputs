  "explanation": "No direct call to try_match_header is present in this function. The only places in this function that could lead to indirect recursion are the function-call expressions; those are included above and should be investigated to determine whether they (directly or indirectly) call try_match_header. All other code fragments in the function are simple control-flow or expression operations (parameter list and function header, the initial NULL check on *suffix, the while loop, the character test 0 != *line, the ++line increment, and the return statements). These do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves cause direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
