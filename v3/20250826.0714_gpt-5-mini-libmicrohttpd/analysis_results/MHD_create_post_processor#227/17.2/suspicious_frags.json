  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 17.2 concern is indirect or direct self-calls. The fragments selected are points where external callbacks, connection lookup routines, or allocation/panic handlers could result in an indirect call path back into MHD_create_post_processor (or into other functions that re-enter this function):\n- the function declaration shows a function-pointer parameter (MHD_PostDataIterator iter) that is stored (ret->ikvi = iter) and could be invoked elsewhere and recursively call this function; storing connection/cls/encoding could also enable later callbacks via those objects.\n- calls to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n and MHD_PANIC involve library/API entry points that might invoke user callbacks or handlers which could indirectly re-enter this function.\n- MHD_calloc_ is included because allocator wrappers or hooks (if present in the environment) might call back into the library.\n\nWhy other fragments are not reported:\n- The string comparison calls (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_), static-length macros (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_), boundary parsing, strlen(), strstr(), and other local/localized computations perform pure data processing and standard library operations that do not invoke user-supplied callbacks or re-entrant library entry points; they cannot directly cause an indirect call back into MHD_create_post_processor.\n- The comment and simple arithmetic/buffer-size adjustments are local computations without function call risk.\n- mhd_assert is typically a local assertion macro (and usually resolves to an abort/trace) and, in common implementations, does not invoke user callbacks that would re-enter the function; therefore it was not included as suspicious. If in your build mhd_assert/MHD_PANIC/MHD_calloc_ are implemented as user-overridable handlers, ensure those implementations are reviewed \u2014 MHD_PANIC and MHD_calloc_ were already included as suspicious for that reason.\n\nIf you want, I can expand the investigation to include other macros/utility functions (mhd_assert, MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) depending on how they are implemented in your build environment."
