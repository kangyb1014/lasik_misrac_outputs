  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions within the provided source fragment. Specifically:\n\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens present in the code such as __attribute__, __declspec, __inline__, typeof, __asm__, statement-expressions ({ ...; }) (GCC extension), nested functions (GCC extension), zero-length arrays, or other known non\u2011standard constructs that compilers explicitly document as extensions.\n\n- Standard library calls and types (strstr, strlen, size_t, NULL) are used and are not extensions.\n\n- Common idioms that sometimes attract MISRA checks (assignment in an if expression, use of macros, pointer arithmetic, leading-underscore identifiers) are present but are not language extensions themselves. For example, the identifier _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name that could expand to a compiler-specific attribute in its definition; however, that expansion is not visible in the provided code. The rule requires reporting explicit uses of language extensions as they appear in source (or documented extension tokens); since no such tokens appear here, there is nothing in this fragment that can be definitively identified as a compiler extension.\n\nIf you want a deeper check for possible hidden extensions, provide the macro definitions (e.g., _MHD_EXTERN, MHD_calloc_, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_PANIC, mhd_assert, etc.). Their expansions could contain compiler-specific extension tokens and should be inspected if available."
