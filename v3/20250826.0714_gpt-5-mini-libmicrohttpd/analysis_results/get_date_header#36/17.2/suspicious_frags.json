  "explanation": "The only function call in this fragment is get_date_str(header + 6); that call should be investigated to ensure it does not call get_date_header (directly or indirectly). The remaining lines are simple assignments and returns (no other function calls, no function-pointer invocations, and no self-call in this function), so they cannot violate Rule 17.2. Also, the function has internal linkage (static) and contains no other calls, so only the implementation of get_date_str (and any functions it calls) needs investigation for possible indirect recursion. No other code fragments in this function are relevant to Rule 17.2."
