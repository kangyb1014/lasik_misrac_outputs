Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_date_header:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_date_header (char *header)\n{\n  if (! get_date_str (header + 6))\n  {\n    header[0] = 0;\n    return false;\n  }\n  header[0] = 'D';\n  header[1] = 'a';\n  header[2] = 't';\n  header[3] = 'e';\n  header[4] = ':';\n  header[5] = ' ';\n  header[35] = '\\r';\n  header[36] = '\\n';\n  header[37] = 0;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nheader[37] = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown context: header[37] = 0 is used to NUL-terminate the constructed header (after writing 'Date: ' at indices 0..5 and CRLF at 35..36). Removing that assignment would change program behaviour (strings not properly terminated), so it is not dead code. It would only be dead (rule violated) if, and only if, get_date_str(header + 6) already always wrote the same NUL at header[37] (or some later code deterministically overwrote it with the same value), making this assignment redundant. Absent evidence that get_date_str always produces that exact termination, the assignment is not dead."
