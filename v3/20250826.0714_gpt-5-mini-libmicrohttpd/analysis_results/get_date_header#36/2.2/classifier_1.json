  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_date_header:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_date_header (char *header)\n{\n  if (! get_date_str (header + 6))\n  {\n    header[0] = 0;\n    return false;\n  }\n  header[0] = 'D';\n  header[1] = 'a';\n  header[2] = 't';\n  header[3] = 'e';\n  header[4] = ':';\n  header[5] = ' ';\n  header[35] = '\\r';\n  header[36] = '\\n';\n  header[37] = 0;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nheader[36] = '\\n';\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment header[36] = '\\n'; is executed when get_date_str(header + 6) returns true and writes the LF character to form the CRLF sequence (header[35]='\\r'; header[36]='\\n'; header[37]=0). Removing this assignment would change the produced header (no LF character), altering program behaviour (output format), so the operation is not dead code."
