  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no call to memcmp (nor any other string-comparison function):\n- The only function call is get_date_str(header + 6), which produces or fills a string but does not compare it.\n- All other operations are direct character assignments to the header buffer (header[0]..header[37]).\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that can violate Rule 21.14, so nothing needs to be escalated for investigation under that rule. (Note: although buffer indexing and termination are present, they are unrelated to the memcmp prohibition and thus are not flagged here.)"
