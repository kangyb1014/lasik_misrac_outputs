  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function writes into the buffer pointed to by header (e.g. header[36] = '\\n';), so header must be a pointer to a modifiable char. Rule 8.13 requires using const-qualified pointer types when possible; here modification is intended, so making header a const char * would be incorrect. A violation would occur if the pointer were declared non-modifiable (const) and the code attempted to write through it, or if a pointer that could be const-qualified (i.e. never used to modify data) was left non-const."
