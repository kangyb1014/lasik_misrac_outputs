  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions or are clearly runtime-dependent: - Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #if defined(...)) are compile-time directives, not C controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. - Function calls and statement expressions (e.g. MHD_destroy_response(...); DLL_remove(...); DLL_insert(...); MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(...); MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(...); assignments like connection->in_cleanup = true;) are not control statements and therefore not relevant to the rule. - The else keywords and block bodies are not controlling expressions themselves. - Assertions and logging macros (mhd_assert(...), MHD_DLOG(...)) are not controlling statements in the code flow (they are macro-expanded checks/logs) and thus are outside the scope of Rule 14.3 as controlling expressions. The listed suspicious fragments include every if-based control expression in the function; those are the points that could be invariant and should be investigated further."
