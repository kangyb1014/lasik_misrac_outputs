  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided cleanup_connection function. The code performs pointer checks (NULL comparisons), boolean flag checks, and calls to internal functions/macros (e.g. DLL_remove, XDLL_remove, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_DLOG) but contains no memcmp calls or explicit character-array / null-terminated string comparisons. The only string literal appears as a logging message passed to MHD_DLOG/_(), not compared with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
