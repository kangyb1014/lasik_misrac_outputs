  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. In particular, the code does not contain any of the common compiler extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions: no __attribute__ or __declspec, no inline assembly (__asm__), no GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), no typeof, no nested functions, no labels-as-values (&&label), no compiler-specific keywords, no compiler pragma constructs, and no use of nonstandard token pasting or trigraphs. The backslash used to continue the string literal across source lines is standard C line-continuation/adjacent-string behavior, not a compiler extension. The boolean literals true/false are standard when using stdbool.h (not a compiler extension). Preprocessor conditionals and macro calls (e.g. MHD_USE_THREADS, DLL_remove, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_) are ordinary C preprocessor/macros and are not, by themselves, compiler extensions \u2014 any extension-like behavior would be in their definitions which are not present in this fragment. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that, by themselves, require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
