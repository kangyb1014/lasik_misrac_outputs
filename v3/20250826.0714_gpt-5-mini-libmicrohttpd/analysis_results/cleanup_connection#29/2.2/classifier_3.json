  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment executes a runtime check and a call to MHD_itc_activate_ (which has observable side\u2011effects: signalling the inter\u2011thread channel). The inner MHD_DLOG call (under HAVE_MESSAGES) produces observable output and/or timing differences, so it is not \u201cdead\u201d (and if HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined the logging code isn\u2019t compiled at all). Therefore there is no operation in this fragment that is executed yet removable without affecting program behaviour."
