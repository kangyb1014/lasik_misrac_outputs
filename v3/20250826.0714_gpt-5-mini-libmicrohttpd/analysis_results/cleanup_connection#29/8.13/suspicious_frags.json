  "explanation": "All other pointer uses in this function are clearly used to modify the pointee or to perform operations that require a non-const pointee, so they do not need investigation under Rule 8.13. Examples: the connection parameter is written to (connection->in_cleanup = true; connection->suspended = false; connection->resuming = false; connection->in_idle = false; connection->rp.response is cleared), list head/tail fields in the daemon are modified by remove/insert operations, the response object is destroyed and reset to NULL, and the mutex is locked/unlocked (addresses of daemon mutex members are passed). Those uses imply the pointers must refer to modifiable objects, so adding const qualification would be inappropriate. The two fragments reported involve passing string/message data (string literal or translated string) to functions \u2014 these call sites should be checked to ensure the callee prototypes take pointers to const-qualified character data (so that passing string literals or const strings conforms to Rule 8.13)."
