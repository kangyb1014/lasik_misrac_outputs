  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided function. The code performs pointer checks (NULL comparisons), a linked-list traversal via pos->next, increments a counter, and calls a user-supplied iterator function. None of these operations invoke memcmp or otherwise perform raw memory comparisons of null-terminated strings. Passing pos->header and pos->value to the iterator does not itself constitute use of memcmp in this code fragment; any memcmp usage inside the iterator is outside the scope of this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
