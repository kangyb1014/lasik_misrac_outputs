  "explanation": "No usages of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The function only: iterates a linked list via pos = response->first_header / pos = pos->next, checks for NULL, increments a counter, and calls an iterator callback passing pos->header and pos->value. There are no buffer copies, concatenations, comparisons or length calculations performed here that could cause accesses beyond object bounds. The only places that deal with string-like data are the pos->header and pos->value arguments passed to the user-supplied iterator; any use of string.h functions on those would occur inside the iterator (outside this function) and must be inspected there, but that is beyond the scope of this function. Therefore, no code fragments in this function need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
