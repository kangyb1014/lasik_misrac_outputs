  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The only loop controlling expression is in the for-loop: \"NULL != pos\" \u2014 pos is updated each iteration by \"pos = pos->next\", so the condition can change and is not invariant. The conditional inside the loop uses the iterator pointer and the result of the function call \"iterator(iterator_cls, ...)\"; that result can vary and thus the if controlling expression is not invariant. There are no do-while or while loops with constant controlling expressions, nor any deliberate infinite loops using invariant expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
