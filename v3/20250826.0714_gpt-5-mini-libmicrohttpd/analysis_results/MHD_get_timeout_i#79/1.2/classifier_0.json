  "scenario": "No explicit language extension is present in the fragment itself. The token _MHD_EXTERN is a macro name and not intrinsically a compiler extension; if its definition expands to plain C (e.g. extern or empty) then there is no Rule 1.2 violation. However, if _MHD_EXTERN is defined elsewhere to a compiler-specific extension (for example __declspec(dllexport), __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) or other compiler-specific keywords documented as extensions), that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. The provided fragment does not contain enough information to prove such an expansion, so based on the fragment alone no violation is evident."
