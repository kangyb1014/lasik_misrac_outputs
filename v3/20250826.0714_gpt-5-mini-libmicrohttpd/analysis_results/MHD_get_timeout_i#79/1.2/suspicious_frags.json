  "explanation": "Only the function declaration that begins with the identifier _MHD_EXTERN is reported for investigation. No other code fragments appear to use compiler-specific language extensions: the preprocessor conditionals (#if / #else / #endif) are standard C preprocessing; SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_INT64_T are build-time macros (not language extensions) and are used in a standard #if expression; int64_t and INT_MAX are standard typedef/macros from <stdint.h> and <limits.h>; the cast (int) to64, return statements, and comments are standard C. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension constructs (for example __attribute__, __declspec, inline assembly, typeof, or vendor-specific keywords) elsewhere in the function."
