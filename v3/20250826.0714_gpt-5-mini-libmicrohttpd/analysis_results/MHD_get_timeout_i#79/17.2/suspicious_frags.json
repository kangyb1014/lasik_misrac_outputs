  "explanation": "The only potential risk for violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect recursion) in this snippet is any call from MHD_get_timeout_i to another function that might (directly or indirectly) call MHD_get_timeout_i. The two listed lines are the only function-call sites present in the function and therefore must be investigated to determine whether MHD_get_timeout64s leads back to MHD_get_timeout_i. All other code in the snippet is non-call logic (preprocessor guards, variable declaration, integer comparison, cast, and return of INT_MAX) and cannot by itself create a recursive call chain, so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
