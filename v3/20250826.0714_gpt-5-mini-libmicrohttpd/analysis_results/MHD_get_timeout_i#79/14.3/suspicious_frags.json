  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are statically invariant. The only runtime controlling expression is:\n  if (INT_MAX >= to64)\nwhich depends on to64 (assigned from the runtime call MHD_get_timeout64s(daemon)) and therefore is not an invariant compile\u2011time constant. The preprocessor conditional (#if SIZEOF_INT >= SIZEOF_INT64_T) is evaluated at translation/compile time and is not a C controlling expression subject to MISRA Rule 14.3. There are no loops (while, for, do-while) with invariant controlling expressions, and no do-while with an essentially Boolean false constant. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
