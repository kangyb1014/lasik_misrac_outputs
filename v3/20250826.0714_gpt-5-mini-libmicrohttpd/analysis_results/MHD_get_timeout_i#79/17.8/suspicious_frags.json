  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the parameter 'daemon' itself. The only use of 'daemon' is as an argument in the call MHD_get_timeout64s(daemon) \u2014 passing a pointer parameter to another function does not modify the pointer variable here. There are no assignments to 'daemon' (no daemon = ...), no pointer arithmetic on 'daemon', and no increments/decrements of the parameter. All other operations assign to local variables (to64), perform a comparison with INT_MAX, cast to int, and return values; these do not violate Rule 17.8. Note: even if MHD_get_timeout64s were to modify the object pointed to by 'daemon', that is permitted by the rule; only changing the pointer parameter itself would be a violation. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
