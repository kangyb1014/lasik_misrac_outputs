Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be const-qualified when possible. Here, 'daemon' can (and should) be declared as 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' and MHD_get_timeout64s should accept a const-qualified pointer if it does not modify the pointed object; as written this constitutes a violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 states that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever doing so is possible (i.e. the object is not modified through that pointer and all uses, including callees, accept const). In the snippet shown MHD_get_timeout_i does not itself modify *daemon, but we do not have the prototype of MHD_get_timeout64s. If MHD_get_timeout64s expects a non-const pointer (or other call sites require a non-const parameter), then MHD_get_timeout_i cannot simply change its parameter to const without changing the callee/API. Thus there is insufficient evidence to conclude a violation. If, however, MHD_get_timeout64s is declared to take a const struct MHD_Daemon * and no other use requires non-const, then making daemon const would be appropriate \u2014 but that information is not provided. Therefore the agent A's claim as stated is not proven and is incorrect."
