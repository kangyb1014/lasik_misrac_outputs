  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_timeout_i:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_timeout_i (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n#if SIZEOF_INT >= SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  return MHD_get_timeout64s (daemon);\n#else  /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n  const int64_t to64 = MHD_get_timeout64s (daemon);\n  if (INT_MAX >= to64)\n    return (int) to64;\n  return INT_MAX;\n#endif /* SIZEOF_INT < SIZEOF_INT64_T */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn MHD_get_timeout64s (daemon);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement returns the value from MHD_get_timeout64s when SIZEOF_INT >= SIZEOF_INT64_T. Removing it would change the function's return behaviour, so the operation affects program behaviour and is not dead code. The fact that the fragment is conditionally compiled out on other configurations does not make it dead (dead code must be executed but removable without effect)."
