In that build/configuration the controlling expression is invariant, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In some translation-unit configurations the controlling expression becomes invariant. ret is initialized to -1 and the only assignments that could change it are inside the preprocessor-protected sysctl/sysctlbyname blocks. If those blocks are excluded (for example when __linux__ is defined, or when the relevant HAVE_SYSCTL/HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME macros are not set) there is no intervening assignment and the final if (0 >= ret) always evaluates true (0 >= -1). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions except for the two listed exceptions (infinite loops and the specific do-while case), neither of which applies here. Because the invariance can occur in valid translation units, this is a violation of Rule 14.3."
