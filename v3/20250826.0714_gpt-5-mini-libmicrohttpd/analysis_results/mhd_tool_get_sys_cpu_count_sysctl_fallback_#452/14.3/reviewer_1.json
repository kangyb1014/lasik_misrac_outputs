  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. If the sysctl blocks are excluded (for example when __linux__ is defined, or neither HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME nor HAVE_SYSCTL are defined) the function body reduces to initializing ret to -1 and immediately testing if (0 >= ret). In that translation unit ret is never modified between initialization and the if, so the controlling expression is invariant (always true). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions (the allowed exceptions do not apply here), so the code as compiled in that configuration would violate the rule. A simple remediation is to avoid leaving the redundant check when the preceding platform-specific code is removed (e.g. conditionally compile the final test only when the sysctl attempts are present, or restructure to return ret directly and handle the fallback at the call site)."
