  "explanation": "I selected the platform-guarded blocks (#ifndef __linux__ ... #endif) and the final return test because these are the places most likely to produce code that is compiled-out or rendered unreachable depending on preprocessor symbols or constant conditions. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: - The initialization (int ret = -1;) is executed and not dead. - The repeated runtime checks if (0 >= ret) are dependent on the variable ret and are not compile-time constant expressions; they are legitimate flow-control for attempting multiple platform-specific probes. - There are no statements following an unconditional return within the same block (no obvious lexical dead code). - Comments and simple declarations (size_t value_size, int mib[2]) are not unreachable code by themselves. - The code inside the guarded blocks is intentionally conditional on feature macros; presence or absence due to preprocessing is expected for portability and should be reviewed in the context of build configuration rather than treated as accidental unreachable code."
