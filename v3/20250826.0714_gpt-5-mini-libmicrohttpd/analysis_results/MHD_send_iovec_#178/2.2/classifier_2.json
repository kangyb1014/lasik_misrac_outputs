  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_iovec_:\n```c\nssize_t\nMHD_send_iovec_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                 struct MHD_iovec_track_ *const r_iov,\n                 bool push_data)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_VECT_SEND\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n  bool use_iov_send = true;\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n#endif /* MHD_VECT_SEND */\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->rp.resp_iov.iov);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->rp.response->data_iov);\n  mhd_assert (connection->rp.resp_iov.cnt > connection->rp.resp_iov.sent);\n#ifdef MHD_VECT_SEND\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send &&\n                 (0 == (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send && (connection->daemon->sigpipe_blocked ||\n                                  connection->sk_spipe_suppress);\n#endif /* _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  if (use_iov_send)\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  return send_iov_nontls (connection, r_iov, push_data);\n#endif /* MHD_VECT_SEND */\n\n#if ! defined(MHD_VECT_SEND) || defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n  return send_iov_emu (connection, r_iov, push_data);\n#endif /* !MHD_VECT_SEND || HTTPS_SUPPORT\n          || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\n#ifdef MHD_VECT_SEND\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send &&\n                 (0 == (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send && (connection->daemon->sigpipe_blocked ||\n                                  connection->sk_spipe_suppress);\n#endif /* _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  if (use_iov_send)\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  return send_iov_nontls (connection, r_iov, push_data);\n#endif /* MHD_VECT_SEND */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code uses preprocessor conditionals to ensure that each executed operation affects control flow: use_iov_send is only declared when needed and the subsequent assignments are only compiled when the runtime-tested TLS/sigpipe conditions are relevant. The \u2018if (use_iov_send)\u2019 is present only when those macros are defined; otherwise the return is unconditional. There is no executed statement whose removal would leave program behaviour unchanged, so this fragment does not introduce dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
