  "explanation": "The fragments selected relate to the conditional use_iov_send declaration/assignments and the two alternative return paths (send_iov_nontls vs send_iov_emu). Depending on which preprocessor symbols are defined, the declaration/initialization of use_iov_send or the conditional assignments to it may be compiled but never used, or one of the return paths may be compiled such that the other path is never reachable in that build \u2014 all situations that can produce executed operations whose removal might not change behaviour in some configurations and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code.\n\nOther parts of the function were not selected because they are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2:\n- The mhd_assert(...) statements are runtime checks; removing them would change error-detection behaviour. They are not dead code.\n- The function signature, parameters and closing braces are structural and required.\n- Any code that is entirely excluded by the preprocessor in a given build is not \"dead code\" in that build (it simply does not exist in the compiled unit). The selected fragments are those that can be present and either unused or make alternate code paths unreachable depending on macro combinations, so they deserve inspection."
