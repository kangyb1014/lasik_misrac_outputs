These fragments are directly relevant to Rule 21.17 because they determine whether the string functions may access beyond the referenced objects.\n\nAll other parts of the function (function signature, local control-flow, return statements, comments, and the #ifdef/#endif wrapper) do not call or affect the parameters to the standard string handling functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation under that rule."
