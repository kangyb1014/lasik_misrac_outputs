  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the sense prohibited by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Details:\n- addr (const struct sockaddr_storage *): only inspected (ss_family) and cast for memcpy source; no assignment to addr, no increment/decrement, no storing through addr. The casts and use in sizeof do not modify the parameter.\n- addrlen (socklen_t): only used in comparisons (no assignment or modification).\n- key (struct MHD_IPCount *): the object pointed-to by key is written (memset, field assignments, memcpy). MISRA Rule 17.8 allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; the prohibition is against modifying the pointer parameter itself. There is no assignment to the pointer variable key (no rebind of key), so this is permitted.\n- Other expressions (sizeof(((const struct sockaddr_in *) NULL)->sin_addr), casting to struct sockaddr_in6) are compile-time/evaluation-safe and do not modify parameters.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing that requires further investigation for this rule."
