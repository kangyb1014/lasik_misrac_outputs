  "explanation": "The provided function contains no use of memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp or other string-comparison functions). It only uses memset and memcpy to manipulate binary socket address structures (in_addr / in6_addr) \u2014 these are fixed-size binary blobs, not null-terminated C strings. The sizeof expressions using a NULL-cast are compile-time size computations, not runtime dereferences. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
