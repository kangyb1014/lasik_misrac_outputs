  "explanation": "No recursive or potentially-recursive calls found in this function. Analysis details:\n- There are only two function calls: memset(...) and memcpy(...). These are standard library memory functions and do not call back into MHD_ip_addr_to_key; they present no risk of direct or indirect recursion.\n- The function makes no calls to MHD_ip_addr_to_key and does not call any other project-defined functions that could indirectly call back into it.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences, no callbacks, and no invocation of function-like macros that would expand to function calls within this function body.\n- The conditional compilation symbol HAVE_INET6 only controls inclusion of code; it does not introduce recursion.\n- The return identifiers MHD_YES and MHD_NO are used as enum/constant return values (not function calls) in the shown code.\n- Uses of sizeof with expressions like ((const struct sockaddr_in *) NULL)->sin_addr are evaluated at compile time and do not perform any runtime dereference or function call.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls)."
