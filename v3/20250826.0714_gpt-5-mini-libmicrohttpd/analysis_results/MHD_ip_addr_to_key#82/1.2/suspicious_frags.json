  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically:\n\n- The casts and sizeof expressions such as sizeof(((const struct sockaddr_in *) NULL)->sin_addr) are standard C (the operand of sizeof is unevaluated, so the NULL dereference is not executed). This is not a compiler extension.\n- The explicit cast (size_t) addrlen is standard C casting, not an extension.\n- The use of types and macros like struct sockaddr_storage, struct sockaddr_in(_6), socklen_t, AF_INET, AF_INET6 and the conditional compilation #ifdef HAVE_INET6 are platform/OS API features and preprocessor usage, not compiler language extensions.\n- Standard library functions and idioms used (memset, memcpy, return of an enum value) are standard C and not extensions.\n- There are no occurrences of well-known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* intrinsics, binary/octal literal extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
