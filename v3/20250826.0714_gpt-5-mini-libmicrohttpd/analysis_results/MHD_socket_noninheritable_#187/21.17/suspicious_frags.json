  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code. The function uses fcntl and SetHandleInformation which are not string.h functions and do not take pointer parameters for character buffers subject to this rule. There are no char* buffers or string/byte-buffer operations in this fragment, so there are no places where accesses beyond object bounds via the string handling functions could occur. Therefore no code fragments need investigation under Rule 21.17."
