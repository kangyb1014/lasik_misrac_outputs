  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_socket_noninheritable_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_socket_noninheritable_ (MHD_socket sock)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (sock,\n                 F_GETFD);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    return 0;\n\n  if ( ((flags | FD_CLOEXEC) != flags) &&\n       (0 != fcntl (sock,\n                    F_SETFD,\n                    flags | FD_CLOEXEC)) )\n    return 0;\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  if (!

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call to SetHandleInformation has observable side\u2011effects (it changes the handle inheritance flag in the OS) and the surrounding conditional affects the function return value, so removing it would change program behaviour. (Hypothetical violation: if SetHandleInformation were a no\u2011op/stub that always succeeds and has no side\u2011effects in the built project, then the call and the conditional could be dead code.)"
