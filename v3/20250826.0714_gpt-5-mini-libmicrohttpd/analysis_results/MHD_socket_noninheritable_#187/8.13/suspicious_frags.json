  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and their const-qualification. The listed fragments involve the function parameter MHD_socket sock and its uses (passed to fcntl and cast to HANDLE for SetHandleInformation) \u2014 these are the places to inspect to determine whether the parameter is a pointer type and, if so, whether it could/should be const-qualified. Other parts of the function (local int flags, bitwise checks, return expressions, preprocessor conditionals) do not declare or manipulate pointer types and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated."
