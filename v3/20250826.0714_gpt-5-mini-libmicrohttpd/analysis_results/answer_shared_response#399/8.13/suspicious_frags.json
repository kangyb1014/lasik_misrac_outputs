  "explanation": "I did not mark fragments that already use const (e.g. the parameters declared as const char *: url, method, version, upload_data) because they already satisfy the rule. The connection parameter (struct MHD_Connection *connection) and the resps/respective API objects are likely part of the external libmicrohttpd API and typically require non-const pointers for the library calls, so changing them to point-to-const may be incompatible with the API; therefore they are not flagged here except where the code shows a direct non-const use that could be const (see listed fragments). Other local variables and arithmetic (resp_index, last_index, num_resps) are not pointer declarations or uses and so are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
