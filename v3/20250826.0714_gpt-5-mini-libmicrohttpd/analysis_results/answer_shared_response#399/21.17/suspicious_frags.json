  "explanation": "No other calls to functions from <string.h> appear in the provided code. The (void) casts for unused parameters, the early req_cls NULL check, the arithmetic on last_index/resp_index, and the call to MHD_queue_response do not invoke string handling functions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Thus only the shown strcmp usage requires investigation under this rule."
