  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. In particular, the code does not use any of the common compiler extensions that are typically documented as extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __asm__ tokens, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, asm volatile, __builtin_* intrinsics, or any vendor-specific keywords). The constructs used are standard C: function-local static variables, volatile, pointer casts (void *) and standard library types (size_t), enum return type, string comparisons, and the modulus/post-increment operations. The MHD_* identifiers are library macros/types (from libmicrohttpd) and not language extensions themselves. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
