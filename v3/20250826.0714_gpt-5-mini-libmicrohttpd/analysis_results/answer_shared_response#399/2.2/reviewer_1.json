Their removal would not affect program behaviour, so they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The two lines \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d and \u201c(void) upload_data_size;\u201d are the common idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to avoid compiler warnings. MISRA's concern in Rule 2.2 is about dead code that affects program behaviour at runtime; these casts are an explicit, intentional \"use\" of the parameters (they convey intent and suppress warnings) and are therefore not treated as dead code in practice. If you prefer to avoid even these expressions, the alternative is to change the function signature (remove unused parameters) or use a documented UNUSED macro/annotation, but the presence of these (void) casts does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation in this context."
