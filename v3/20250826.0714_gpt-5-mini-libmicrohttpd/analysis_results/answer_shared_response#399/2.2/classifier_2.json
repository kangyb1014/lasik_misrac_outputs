Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of answer_shared_response:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nanswer_shared_response (void *cls,\n                        struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                        const char *url,\n                        const char *method,\n                        const char *version,\n                        const char *upload_data,\n                        size_t *upload_data_size,\n                        void **req_cls)\n{\n  static int marker = 0;\n  unsigned int resp_index;\n  static volatile unsigned int last_index = 0;\n  (void) cls;  /* Unused */\n  (void) url; (void) version; /* Unused */\n  (void) upload_data; (void) upload_data_size; /* Unused */\n\n  if (NULL == *req_cls)\n  {\n    /* The fist call */\n    *req_cls = (void *) &marker;\n    /* Do not send reply yet.
