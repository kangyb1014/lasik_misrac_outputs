  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Rule 2.2 forbids any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The statements (void) url; and (void) version; are expression-statements that have no side-effects for non-volatile pointer parameters; removing them would not change the program behaviour, so they meet the provided definition of dead code. (Of course such cast-to-void idioms are commonly used to silence unused-parameter warnings, but that does not change that they are dead code under the text of Rule 2.2 unless the expression evaluation had observable effects \u2014 e.g. the objects were volatile or evaluation could trap, which is not the case here.)"
