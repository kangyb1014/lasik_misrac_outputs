  "explanation": "No syntactically or statically unreachable code fragments were identified. Reasoning:\n- All return statements occur within conditional branches (if blocks) whose conditions depend on runtime values (req_cls, method strings). These branches can be taken or not taken at runtime, so none of the subsequent statements are provably unreachable at compile time.\n- There are no unconditional returns that make following statements in the same function unreachable (each return is guarded by a condition).\n- There are no constant expressions (e.g., #if 0, if (0) ...) that would render code unreachable at compile time.\n- There are no labels/gotos or switch/case constructs that leave any case unreachable by language rules.\n\nNotes (not flagged as unreachable but relevant to review by other rules): dereferencing *req_cls without checking req_cls for NULL and the modulo by num_resps (which must not be zero) are potential runtime issues, but they do not constitute unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1."
