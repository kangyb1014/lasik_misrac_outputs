  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs a pointer check/assignment and returns; it does not call answer_shared_response (directly or indirectly). A violation would occur if the function invoked itself (e.g. return answer_shared_response(...);) or called another function that in turn called answer_shared_response, creating recursion."
