  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or the pointed-to objects are intentionally mutable: - The function parameter 'const struct sockaddr_storage *addr' is already const-qualified. - The 'daemon' parameter (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon) and the code that uses it call lock/unlock and modify daemon state (per_ip_connection_count, etc.), so the pointed-to type cannot be made const. - 'newkeyp' and 'keyp' are used to initialize and update the IP-count structure (MHD_ip_addr_to_key writes into newkeyp; keyp->count is incremented), so their pointees are intentionally mutable and should not be const-qualified. - Calls to free() and uses of malloc() are standard and do not indicate that the allocated/object types should be const. The selected fragments involve casting and pointer-to-pointer usage (tsearch return cast and nodep/keyp handling) and the malloc cast; these may hide or discard const-qualification or otherwise affect whether the pointer types could or should be const-qualified and therefore warrant investigation."
