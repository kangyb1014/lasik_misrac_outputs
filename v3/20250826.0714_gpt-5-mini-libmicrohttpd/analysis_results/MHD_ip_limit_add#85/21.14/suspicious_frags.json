  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp appears in this function, and no null\u2011terminated string comparisons are performed here. Most other fragments are memory management, pointer handling, numeric comparison, or locking operations and thus are not relevant to Rule 21.14. The only places that could hide a memcmp-based string comparison are the called/ referenced routines (MHD_ip_addr_to_key and the comparator referenced by &MHD_ip_addr_compare); those implementations should be inspected separately. All other lines in this function do not perform string comparisons and therefore do not need investigation for this rule."
