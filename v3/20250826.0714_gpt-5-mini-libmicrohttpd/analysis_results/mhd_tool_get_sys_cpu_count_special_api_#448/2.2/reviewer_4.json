The WinAPI GetNativeSystemInfo fills the SYSTEM_INFO structure itself, so the prior memset has no effect on program behaviour; removing it would not change the behaviour. Therefore this executed operation is redundant dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the ptrGetNativeSystemInfo branch the code zeroes sysInfo with memset immediately before calling ptrGetNativeSystemInfo(&sysInfo). The Windows API GetNativeSystemInfo is documented to fill the SYSTEM_INFO structure; the code only reads sysInfo.dwNumberOfProcessors afterwards (and compares it against the cast result). Given a conforming implementation of GetNativeSystemInfo, the prior memset does not affect any observable behaviour and therefore is a redundant executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 i.e. dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If one were to defend the memset as defensive against a non\u2011conforming or buggy external implementation, that is a maintenance decision; strictly speaking the operation is redundant with a correct WinAPI.)"
