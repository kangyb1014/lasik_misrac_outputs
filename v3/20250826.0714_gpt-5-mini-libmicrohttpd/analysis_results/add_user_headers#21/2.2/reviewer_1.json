True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nOne of the two assignments is redundant (dead) in every execution of that block. Given the earlier mhd_assert and the surrounding logic, add_close and add_keep_alive cannot both be true when entering the if (add_close || add_keep_alive) block; exactly one of them is true. Therefore, after adding the token, setting the already-false flag to false again (either add_keep_alive = false when add_close was the true flag, or add_close = false when add_keep_alive was the true flag) is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour. This constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The two assignments \"add_close = false; add_keep_alive = false;\" are not provably dead in all executions. The agent\u2019s argument depends on the mhd_assert and surrounding logic guaranteeing that exactly one of the two flags is true when entering the (add_close || add_keep_alive) block, so one of the two assignments would always write the same value and could be removed. That reasoning is flawed for two reasons:\n\n1) mhd_assert is a diagnostic/assertion macro (usually removed in non\u2011debug builds). It does not constitute a runtime guarantee for all builds. Code that relies on an assert for functional correctness is not a safe basis for proving an operation is dead. If both flags were true at runtime (possible when asserts are disabled or if callers pass both true), then both assignments are needed: clearing the second flag prevents subsequent headers from also receiving the token.\n\n2) Even ignoring the assert, there are code paths that could leave both flags true (they are function parameters), so the unconditional clearing of both flags ensures the token is only added once across future loop iterations. Removing one of the assignments would change behavior in such scenarios.\n\nBecause there exist executions in which each assignment can affect later behaviour, they are not dead code as defined by MISRA Rule 2.2. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
