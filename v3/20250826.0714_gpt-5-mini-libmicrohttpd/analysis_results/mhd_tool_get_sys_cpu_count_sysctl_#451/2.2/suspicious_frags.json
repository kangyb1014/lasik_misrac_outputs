  "explanation": "I selected the repeated failure-handling assignments that set ret = -1 after sysctl/sysctlbyname calls. These assignments are executed in many branches and may be redundant (assigning the same value multiple times) depending on runtime outcomes; they should be inspected to determine whether any of those assignments are truly necessary or constitute dead code per Rule 2.2.\n\nWhy other fragments do NOT need investigation for Rule 2.2:\n- The #ifndef __linux__ and the other conditional compilation directives (#ifdef HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME, #if defined(HAVE_SYSCTL) && ...) are compile-time platform guards. Code excluded by these macros is not part of the compiled program and therefore not subject to runtime dead-code detection.\n- The initial initialization int ret = -1; is meaningful: it establishes a sentinel/failure value used by subsequent checks and the final return. It is referenced by control flow (if (0 >= ret)) and thus not dead.\n- The repeated if (0 >= ret) checks are control-flow logic to attempt multiple platform-specific queries in sequence; they are reachable and affect whether later blocks execute, so they are not dead.\n- Declarations like size_t value_size = sizeof (ret); and the mib arrays are used as in/out parameters to the sysctl/sysctlbyname APIs; their initialization and use are meaningful (value_size may be modified by the API), so they are not dead.\n- The sysctlbyname/sysctl calls themselves are observable operations (they query the system) and their results affect ret and program behavior; they are not dead.\n\nThe fragments I reported are the points most likely to contain operations that are executed yet redundant (reassigning ret = -1 when ret already has that value). Those should be investigated to determine whether removing them would change behavior (and thus whether they violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2)."
