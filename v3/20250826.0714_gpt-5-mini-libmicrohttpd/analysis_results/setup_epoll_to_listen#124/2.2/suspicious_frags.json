  "explanation": "I focused on conditional blocks, assignments inside assertions, API setup calls and adding FDs to epoll because these are the places most likely to contain executed operations that might be redundant (dead) or have side-effects only in some build/configurations. I did NOT include simple declarations (\"struct epoll_event event; MHD_socket ls;\"), the final \"return MHD_YES;\", or the assignments to event.events alone because: - Declarations are not executable operations that could be removed without effect (initialization differs from assignment per the rule notes). - The final return is the required function result. - Setting event.events is required before epoll_ctl to define the interest mask; removing it would change behaviour. I also did not mark the epoll_ctl calls themselves as non-suspicious, because they are observable system calls that clearly affect behaviour and thus are not dead code. The listed fragments should be investigated to determine whether any of those executed operations can be removed without affecting program behaviour (e.g. assignments inside asserts that may be compiled out, setup_epoll_fd calls or conditional setup paths that are never used in some configurations, or duplicated/ineffective assignments)."
