  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_param__thread_per_conn:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_param__thread_per_conn (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    return ! 0;\n\n  if (tool_params.epoll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"'Thread-per-connection' mode cannot be used together \"\n             \"with 'epoll'.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  num_threads = 1;\n\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (tool_params.epoll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"'Thread-per-connection' mode cannot be used together \"\n             \"with 'epoll'.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if block is executed when tool_params.epoll is true: it prints an error message and returns 0. Removing these statements would change program behaviour (loss of diagnostic output and different return/control flow), so the operations are not dead code."
