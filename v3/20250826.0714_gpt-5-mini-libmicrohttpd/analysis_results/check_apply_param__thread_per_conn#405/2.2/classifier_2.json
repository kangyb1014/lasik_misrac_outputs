  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_param__thread_per_conn:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_param__thread_per_conn (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    return ! 0;\n\n  if (tool_params.epoll)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"'Thread-per-connection' mode cannot be used together \"\n             \"with 'epoll'.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  num_threads = 1;\n\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! tool_params.thread_per_conn)\n    return ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment 'return ! 0;' evaluates the constant expression '!0' (which is 1) and returns it; this operation affects control flow and the function's return value. Removing that return (or the computation) would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (A contrived violation would be an executed statement whose result is never used and has no side effects \u2014 e.g. calling a pure function and discarding its result \u2014 but that is not the case here.)"
