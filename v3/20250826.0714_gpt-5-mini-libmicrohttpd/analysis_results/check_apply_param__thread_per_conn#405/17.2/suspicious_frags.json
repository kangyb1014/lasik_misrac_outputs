  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function body exhibit direct or indirect calls to check_apply_param__thread_per_conn. The only function call present is fprintf(), which is a standard library I/O function and does not call this function. Other operations are boolean tests, member accesses (tool_params.thread_per_conn, tool_params.epoll), an assignment (num_threads = 1) and simple return expressions (return !0; return 0;). None of these are function calls that could produce recursion.\n\nNotes for reviewers: the only potential area outside this fragment that could hide a call is if identifiers used here (e.g. fprintf, tool_params, num_threads) are macros that expand to code invoking this function \u2014 that is not visible in the provided fragment. Based on the given code only, there is no recursion to investigate."
