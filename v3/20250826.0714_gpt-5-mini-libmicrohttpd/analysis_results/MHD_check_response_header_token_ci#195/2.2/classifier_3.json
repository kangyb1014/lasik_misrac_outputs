  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_check_response_header_token_ci:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_check_response_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                    const char *key,\n                                    size_t key_len,\n                                    const char *token,\n                                    size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) ||\n       ('\\0' == key[0]) ||\n       (NULL == token) ||\n       ('\\0' == token[0]) )\n    return false;\n\n  /* Token must not contain binary zero! */\n  mhd_assert (strlen (token) == token_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ( (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) &&\n         (key_len == pos->header_size) &&\n         MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header,\n                                        key,\n                                        key_len) &&\n         MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value,\n                                      token,\n                                      token_len) )\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (strlen (token) == token_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The mhd_assert call evaluates strlen(token) and compares to token_len purely as an invariant check. The assert macro typically either expands to nothing in production or only aborts on failure; the strlen() call has no side effects. Therefore the operation is executed only to perform a check whose removal would not change normal program behaviour (except for abort-on-failure), so it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. Example: when mhd_assert is disabled (e.g. NDEBUG-like build), the assertion (and strlen call) is removed \u2014 its removal does not alter the program\u2019s observable behaviour in correct runs \u2014 hence this is a violation."
