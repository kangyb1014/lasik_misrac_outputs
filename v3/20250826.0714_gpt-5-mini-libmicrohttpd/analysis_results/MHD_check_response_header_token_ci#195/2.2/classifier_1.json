  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_check_response_header_token_ci:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_check_response_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                    const char *key,\n                                    size_t key_len,\n                                    const char *token,\n                                    size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) ||\n       ('\\0' == key[0]) ||\n       (NULL == token) ||\n       ('\\0' == token[0]) )\n    return false;\n\n  /* Token must not contain binary zero! */\n  mhd_assert (strlen (token) == token_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ( (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) &&\n         (key_len == pos->header_size) &&\n         MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header,\n                                        key,\n                                        key_len) &&\n         MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value,\n                                      token,\n                                      token_len) )\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif ( (NULL == key) ||\n       ('\\0' == key[0]) ||\n       (NULL == token) ||\n       ('\\0' == token[0]) )\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The conditional checks for (NULL == key), key[0]=='\\0', (NULL == token) and token[0]=='\\0' are active runtime guards that prevent undefined behaviour (e.g. dereferencing a NULL pointer or calling strlen(NULL)) and change the function's control flow by returning false early. Removing them would alter program behaviour (possible crashes or different results), so these statements are not dead code."
