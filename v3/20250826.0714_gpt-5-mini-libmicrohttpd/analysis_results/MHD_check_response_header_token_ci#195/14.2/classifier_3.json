  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_check_response_header_token_ci:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_check_response_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                    const char *key,\n                                    size_t key_len,\n                                    const char *token,\n                                    size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) ||\n       ('\\0' == key[0]) ||\n       (NULL == token) ||\n       ('\\0' == token[0]) )\n    return false;\n\n  /* Token must not contain binary zero! */\n  mhd_assert (strlen (token) == token_len);\n\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ( (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) &&\n         (key_len == pos->header_size) &&\n         MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header,\n                                        key,\n                                        key_len) &&\n         MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value,\n                                      token,\n                                      token_len) )\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value,\n                                      token,\n                                      token_len)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the for loop\u2019s clauses are pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next. The fragment MHD_str_has_token_caseless_(pos->value, token, token_len) appears in the loop body and only reads pos->value (and token parameters). Rule 14.2 requires the second clause to use only the loop counter (NULL != pos) and the third clause to modify only the loop counter (pos = pos->next) \u2014 both satisfied. This is compliant provided MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ has no persistent side effects (i.e. it does not modify pos, pos->next or any object used by the loop clauses). If that function does modify the loop counter or objects used in the clauses, then the code would violate Rule 14.2."
