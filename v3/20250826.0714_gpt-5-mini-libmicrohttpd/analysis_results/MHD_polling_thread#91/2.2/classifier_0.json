  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_polling_thread:\n```c\nstatic MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_ MHD_THRD_CALL_SPEC_\nMHD_polling_thread (void *cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = cls;\n#ifdef HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK\n  sigset_t s_mask;\n  int err;\n#endif /* HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK */\n\n  MHD_thread_handle_ID_set_current_thread_ID_ (&(daemon->tid));\n#ifdef HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK\n  if ((0 == sigemptyset (&s_mask)) &&\n      (0 == sigaddset (&s_mask, SIGPIPE)))\n  {\n    err = pthread_sigmask (SIG_BLOCK, &s_mask, NULL);\n  }\n  else\n    err = errno;\n  if (0 == err)\n    daemon->sigpipe_blocked = true;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  else\n    MHD_DLOG (daemon,\n              _ (\"Failed to block SIGPIPE on daemon thread: %s\\n\"),\n              MHD_strerror_ (errno));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n#endif /* HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK */\n  while (! daemon->shutdown)\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_POLL\n    if (MHD_D_IS_USING_POLL_ (daemon))\n      MHD_poll (daemon, MHD_YES);\n    else\n#endif /* HAVE_POLL */\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n    if (MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_ (daemon))\n      MHD_epoll (daemon, -1);\n    else\n#endif\n    MHD_select (daemon, -1);\n    MHD_cleanup_connections (daemon);\n  }\n\n  /* Resume any pending for resume connections, join\n   * all connection's threads (if any) and finally cleanup\n   * everything. */\n  if (0 != (MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME & daemon->options))\n    resume_suspended_connections (daemon);\n  close_all_connections (daemon);\n\n  return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nclose_all_connections (daemon);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No \u2014 based on the shown code alone this is not a violation. The call to close_all_connections(daemon) is an executed operation that plausibly has observable side\u2011effects (closing sockets, freeing resources), so its removal would likely change program behaviour. There is no evidence here that the call is redundant or a no\u2011op.\n\nSpecific violation scenario (when it WOULD violate Rule 2.2): if, for the given build configuration, close_all_connections is in fact a no\u2011op (for example it is defined as an empty function or macro: static inline void close_all_connections(struct MHD_Daemon *d) { (void)d; } or #define close_all_connections(x) ((void)0)), or if earlier cleanup already guarantees that nothing remains to do and the function has no observable side\u2011effects, then the call is dead code because removing it would not affect program behaviour."
