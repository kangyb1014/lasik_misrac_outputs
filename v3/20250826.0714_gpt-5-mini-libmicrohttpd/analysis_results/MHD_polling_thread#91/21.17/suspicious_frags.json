  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function. The only call site in this function that could involve the C string-handling library (directly or via a wrapper) is the MHD_strerror_() usage passed to MHD_DLOG, which is why that fragment is reported. All other statements and calls in this function do not invoke any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and therefore do not need investigation for this rule. Specifically, the other code uses thread and signal APIs (MHD_thread_handle_ID_set_current_thread_ID_, sigemptyset, sigaddset, pthread_sigmask), control flow and polling/selection helpers (MHD_poll, MHD_epoll, MHD_select), and connection-management helpers (MHD_cleanup_connections, resume_suspended_connections, close_all_connections) \u2014 none of which are uses of the standard string.h functions in this translation unit."
