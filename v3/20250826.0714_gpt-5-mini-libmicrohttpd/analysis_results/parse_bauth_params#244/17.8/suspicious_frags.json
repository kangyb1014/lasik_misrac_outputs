  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying function parameter variables (the pointer itself), but allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter. In this function there are no assignments to the parameter variables 'str' or 'pbauth' (no occurrences like 'str = ...' or 'pbauth = ...'). The only writes are to members of the object pointed to by pbauth (pbauth->token68.str and pbauth->token68.len), which is permitted by the rule. The 'str' parameter is declared const and is only read (str[i]), so it is not modified. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
