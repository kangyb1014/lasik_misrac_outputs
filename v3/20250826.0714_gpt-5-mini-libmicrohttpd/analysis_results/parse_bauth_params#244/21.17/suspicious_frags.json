  "explanation": "This function does not call any <string.h> routines directly. Many statements in the function are simple declarations, assignments, guarded index checks and returns that do not invoke Standard Library string functions; such lines (variable declarations, initial i = 0, the final return true/false paths, assertions, and comments) are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and therefore do not require investigation. The fragments listed above are reported for further inspection by other agents."
