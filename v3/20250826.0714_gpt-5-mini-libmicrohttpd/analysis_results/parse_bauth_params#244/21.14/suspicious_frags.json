  "explanation": "No usage of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code performs direct character-by-character comparisons (e.g. ' ' == str[i], ',' == str[i], 0 == str[i]) and pointer/length arithmetic using the provided str_len; it does not call memcmp or any wrapper that would compare null-terminated strings. All string handling is length-aware (uses str_len and token68_len) rather than relying on null-termination, so there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this snippet."
