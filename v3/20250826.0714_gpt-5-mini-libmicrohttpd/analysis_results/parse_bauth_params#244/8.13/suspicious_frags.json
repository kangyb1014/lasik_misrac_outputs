  "explanation": "Only fragments involving pointer-to-non-const that might violate Rule 8.13 are reported. The input buffer pointer is correctly declared as const char *str and is only read via str[i] (no modification), so those usages are compliant. The function parameter pbauth is written to inside the function (its fields are assigned), so making pbauth itself a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate. No other pointer declarations or pointer assignments occur in the function. The key point to verify is the type of pbauth->token68.str in struct MHD_RqBAuth: if it is a non-const char * then assigning str (const char *) to it would violate the requirement that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. If pbauth->token68.str is already const char *, then the assignment is fine and no violation is present."
