Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

Similarly, simple control-flow structure (the function header/return) and variable declarations are required. The listed fragments were selected because they are conditional checks, an assertion, or assignments whose presence or removal might not affect observable behaviour in some builds (e.g. assertions compiled out) and therefore deserve investigation for potential dead code. No other lines appear to be redundant or removable without altering the function's behavior."
