  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_bauth_params:\n```c\nstatic bool\nparse_bauth_params (const char *str,\n                    size_t str_len,\n                    struct MHD_RqBAuth *pbauth)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  i = 0;\n\n  /* Skip all whitespaces at start */\n  while (i < str_len && (' ' == str[i] || '\\t' == str[i]))\n    i++;\n\n  if (str_len > i)\n  {\n    size_t token68_start;\n    size_t token68_len;\n\n    /* 'i' points to the first non-whitespace char after scheme token */\n    token68_start = i;\n    /* Find end of the token.

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The assertion mhd_assert(0 != token68_len); is redundant: token68_len is computed as i - token68_start where token68_start is set to the first non-whitespace character and the subsequent loop that advances i over the token executes at least once, so token68_len is guaranteed > 0. Thus the assert has no effect on program behaviour (its removal would not change behaviour), so it is executed but constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
