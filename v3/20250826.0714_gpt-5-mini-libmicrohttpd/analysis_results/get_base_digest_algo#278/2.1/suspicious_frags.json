  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the supplied function. Rationale:\n- The function contains a single straight-line sequence: variable declaration, assignment, and return. There are no conditional branches (if/switch), loops, or labels/goto statements that could create unreachable code paths.\n- There is no code after the return statement, so there are no statements that are never executed.\n- The bitwise expression uses duplicated macro symbols (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION appears twice), which is redundant but does not create unreachable code; it may be a logic/typo concern but is not a Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) violation.\n- All statements in the function are reachable on every call: the assignment is always executed and the cast/return is always executed.\nTherefore, no fragments in this function need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want investigation for other rules (e.g., logical errors or duplicate constants), indicate that and I will flag relevant fragments."
