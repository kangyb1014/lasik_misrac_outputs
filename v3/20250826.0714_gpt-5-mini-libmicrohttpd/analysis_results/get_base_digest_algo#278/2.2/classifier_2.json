  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_base_digest_algo:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline enum MHD_DigestBaseAlgo\nget_base_digest_algo (enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 algo3)\n{\n  unsigned int base_algo;\n\n  base_algo =\n    ((unsigned int) algo3)\n    & ~((unsigned int)\n        (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION\n         | MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION));\n  return (enum MHD_DigestBaseAlgo) base_algo;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION | MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The fragment performs a bitwise OR of the same macro with itself: (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION | MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION). This is redundant because X | X == X, so the duplicate operand (and the redundant OR) can be removed without changing program behaviour. Therefore this constitutes dead (redundant) code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
