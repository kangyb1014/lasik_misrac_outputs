  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The code contains only standard C constructs (preprocessor conditionals, function calls, casts, bitwise/logical operators, and local variable declarations). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as inline assembly, compiler-specific keywords or builtins (for example __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, or nonstandard pragma usage), nor any nonstandard token pasting or other vendor-specific language features. Platform-specific APIs (fcntl, ioctlsocket, FIONBIO, F_GETFL, O_NONBLOCK) are library/OS interfaces, not language extensions, so they do not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Therefore no fragments require investigation under this rule."
