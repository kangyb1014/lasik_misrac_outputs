  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter 'sock'. The code only uses 'sock' as an argument to fcntl/ioctlsocket (passed by value), and there are no assignments to 'sock' or operations that change the pointer itself. The variable 'flags' (and its address &flags) is a local variable and may be modified \u2014 that is allowed. The bitwise operations operate on the local 'flags' copy. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
