  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is inside an #elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS) block so it is compiled and reachable when MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS is defined. The control flow inside the fragment is reachable: ioctlsocket(...) either returns non\u2011zero (causing the if to execute return 0) or returns zero and execution continues to the function's final return. There are no statements that can never be executed. (A violation would occur only if code were present in the compiled translation unit that can never be executed at run time, e.g. code placed after an unconditional return within the same compilation branch or a branch that is never compiled in any build configuration \u2014 neither is the case here.)"
