  "explanation": "The preprocessor-alternatives (#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS) / #elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)) create mutually exclusive compilation paths; each of the two guarded blocks should be investigated because, depending on which macros are (mis)defined, one block may never be compiled/executed (i.e. effectively unreachable in that build). No other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1: there is no code textually after an unconditional return within the same compilation branch (no trivially dead statements), and the final \"return ! 0;\" is reachable from both guarded branches when their conditional returns are not taken. The preprocessor directive lines and the end-comment (/* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */) are not executable code and do not constitute unreachable code in the compiled output."
