  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function MHD_socket_nonblocking_ does not call itself directly; there are no calls to function pointers, no local or global variables that are invoked as functions, and no other function calls in this snippet that could obviously resolve to MHD_socket_nonblocking_. The only function calls present are fcntl and ioctlsocket (platform/OS API calls), and the identifiers F_GETFL, F_SETFL, FIONBIO are macros/constants, not function calls. Conditional compilation branches only select between these OS calls and do not introduce any indirect or recursive calls. Therefore no code in the provided snippet appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
