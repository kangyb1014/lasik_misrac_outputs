  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the input string parameter is declared as const (const char *str), there are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed local variables in the function, and uses of str are by indexing (str[i]) rather than passing pointer-typed objects. Casts and integer operations (e.g. (unsigned char) str[i], (uint64_t) digit) are not pointer-type issues. Therefore only the listed fragments involve a pointer type that should be reviewed with respect to Rule 8.13."
