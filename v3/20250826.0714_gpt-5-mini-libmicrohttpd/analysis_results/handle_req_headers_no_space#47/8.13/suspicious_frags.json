  "explanation": "Only non-const pointer usages are relevant to Rule 8.13. add_header is already const-qualified (const char *), add_header_size and err_code are non-pointer scalar types, and string/macro tokens (ERR_MSG_REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_BIG, MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS) are not pointer declarations here. No other pointer declarations or uses appear in this function. The flagged fragments cover the non-const pointer parameter and its usages that should be reviewed to determine whether the pointer could safely be const-qualified given the called functions' expectations."
