  "explanation": "No language extensions are present in the provided fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function definition, standard storage-class specifier (static), pointer parameters, the const qualifier, the standard type size_t, and ordinary function calls. There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, pragma directives, GCC statement-expressions, inline assembly, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore no fragments need to be investigated for Rule 1.2."
