Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_req_headers_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_req_headers_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                             const char *add_header,\n                             size_t add_header_size)\n{\n  unsigned int err_code;\n\n  err_code = get_no_space_err_status_code (c,\n                                           MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS,\n                                           add_header,\n                                           add_header_size);\n  transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                  err_code,\n                                  ERR_MSG_REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_BIG);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nerr_code = get_no_space_err_status_code (c,\n                                           MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS,\n                                           add_header,\n                                           add_header_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment stores the return value of get_no_space_err_status_code into err_code which is then passed to transmit_error_response_static on the next line. Removing the assignment (or the call) would change the value passed to transmit_error_response_static and thus change program behaviour, so this operation is not dead code."
