  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function only reads its parameters and assigns a value to a local variable (err_code). There are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like c = ..., add_header = ..., add_header_size = ...), no pointer arithmetic, no increments/decrements of parameters, and no casts that would modify the pointer parameters. Passing the pointers to other functions is allowed; although those callees might modify the objects pointed to, Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the parameter variables themselves, which does not occur here."
