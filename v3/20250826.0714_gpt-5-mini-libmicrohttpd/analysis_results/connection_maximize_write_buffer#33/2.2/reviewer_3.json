True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf mhd_assert is an ordinary diagnostic/assertion macro that produces no observable side-effects (for example it expands to ((void)0) in production or only checks the condition and aborts/logs on failure), then the statement is a purely diagnostic operation whose removal would not change the normal program behaviour. In that case the assertion represents dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. If, however, mhd_assert has observable side-effects in the deployed build (e.g. it logs, increments counters, changes state, or otherwise affects program behaviour), then this line would not be dead code and would not violate Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the mhd_assert call is dead code depends on what the macro expands to in the project configuration, which the agent A did not establish. Two important points: (1) If mhd_assert expands to ((void)0) (i.e. it is compiled away), the assertion is not executed at runtime and therefore does not meet the rule's definition of dead code (dead code must be executed). (2) If mhd_assert expands to a diagnostic action (logging/abort/counters) then it has observable behaviour and is not dead. Only in the very narrow case where mhd_assert expands to code that is executed but has truly no observable effect in any build could it be considered dead \u2014 but that is a factual question about the macro definition and build configuration, not something that can be concluded from the snippet alone. Therefore the blanket claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not justified without inspecting the definition/behaviour of mhd_assert in the project."
