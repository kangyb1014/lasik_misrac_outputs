  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement is an invariant check (mhd_assert (c->write_buffer_size >= c->write_buffer_append_offset)); it is not dead code. The assertion documents and enforces a runtime invariant and its handler may produce diagnostics or abort the program on failure; removing the assertion could change behaviour in fault cases (it could allow execution to continue and trigger undefined behaviour later). Therefore this operation is not an instance of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 dead code. (Note: if mhd_assert is defined as a compile-time no-op in release builds, the line will not be executed in those builds; Rule 2.2 applies only to executed operations.)"
