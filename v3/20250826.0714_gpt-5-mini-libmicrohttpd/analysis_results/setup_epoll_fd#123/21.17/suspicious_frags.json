  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. The code only calls epoll_create/epoll_create1, MHD logging macros, and helper functions (MHD_socket_last_strerr_, MHD_socket_noninheritable_) and performs no manual buffer or string manipulation that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
