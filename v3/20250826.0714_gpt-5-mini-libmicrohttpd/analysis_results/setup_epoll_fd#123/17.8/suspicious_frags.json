  "explanation": "No code in the provided function modifies the parameter itself. The parameter is a pointer (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon) and it is only: (a) explicitly cast to void to silence a compiler warning, (b) passed as an argument to logging macros/functions, or (c) otherwise read. There are no assignments to daemon (no expressions like daemon = ..., ++daemon, daemon += ..., or taking its address to overwrite it), and there are no dereference assignments (no *daemon = ...). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 the only prohibition relevant here is modifying the parameter object (the pointer variable) \u2014 which does not occur. Passing the pointer to functions/macros that may modify the object pointed-to is permitted by the rule and is present only as allowed uses (e.g. MHD_DLOG(daemon,...)). Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate in this code."
