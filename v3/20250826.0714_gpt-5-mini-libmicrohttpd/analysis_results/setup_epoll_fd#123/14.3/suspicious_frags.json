  "explanation": "No runtime controlling expression in this function is invariant. The code contains no iteration statements (for/while/do-while) and the only selection (controlling) expressions are:\n- if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET == fd)\n- if (! MHD_socket_noninheritable_ (fd))\nBoth depend on the runtime value of fd (returned by epoll_create/epoll_create1) or on a function call result, so they are not compile-time invariant. The preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #ifndef / #if) are compile-time directives, not C controlling expressions covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3. There are no do-while loops, no intentional infinite-loop invariants, and no other constant controlling expressions present; therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
