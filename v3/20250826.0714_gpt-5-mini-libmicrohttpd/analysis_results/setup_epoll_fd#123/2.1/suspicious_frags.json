  "explanation": "The remaining code in the function consists of normal runtime control flow (declaration of fd, the if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET == fd) runtime check and its return, and the final return fd;). Those constructs are not compile-time constant and therefore are potentially reachable at runtime and do not, by themselves, indicate unreachable code. There are no other returns, unconditional jumps, or code after unconditional returns that would create unreachable statements. The fragments reported above are preprocessor-conditional blocks (and logging stubs) that vary between translation units/build configurations and therefore deserve inspection to ensure no configuration produces unreachable code. Other code in the function is straightforward runtime logic and does not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
