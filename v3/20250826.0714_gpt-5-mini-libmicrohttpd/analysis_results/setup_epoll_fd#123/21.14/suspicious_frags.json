  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code fragment. The function only calls system functions (epoll_create1/epoll_create), integer comparisons (fd == MHD_INVALID_SOCKET), logging macros (MHD_DLOG, _()), and MHD_socket_noninheritable_. None of these expand to or invoke memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
