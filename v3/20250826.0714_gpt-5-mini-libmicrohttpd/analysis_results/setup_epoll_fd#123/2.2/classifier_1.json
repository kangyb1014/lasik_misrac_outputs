  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of setup_epoll_fd:\n```c\nstatic int\nsetup_epoll_fd (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  int fd;\n\n#ifndef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  (void) daemon; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n#endif /* !

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The only statements in the fragment that have effect are the evaluation of MHD_socket_noninheritable_(fd) and, conditionally, the diagnostic call MHD_DLOG when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined. If HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined the compound statement is empty, but the condition (and the function call) is still evaluated \u2014 removing the if would remove that side-effecting call, changing behaviour. If the function never returns false then the body is merely unreachable; per Note 2 unreachable code is not classified as dead code. Therefore this fragment does not constitute MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 dead code."
