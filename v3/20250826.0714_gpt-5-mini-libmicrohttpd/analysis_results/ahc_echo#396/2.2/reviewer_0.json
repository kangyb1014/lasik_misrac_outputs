True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe statement '(void) url;' is a self-contained no-op used to silence an unused-parameter warning. It is executed but has no effect; removing it would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. This is not unreachable code or an initialization, therefore the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statements like (void) url; are deliberate cast-to-void idioms used to document an unused parameter and suppress compiler warnings. MISRA Rule 2.2 is aimed at runtime \"dead code\" \u2014 operations executed at run time whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The void-cast has no runtime side\u2011effects, but its purpose is to affect compile-time diagnostics and to document intent; removing it can change the build (warnings) even if it does not change observable runtime behaviour. In MISRA practice the explicit (void) parameter cast is the accepted, documented way to mark unused parameters and is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation. Therefore agent A's claim that this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
