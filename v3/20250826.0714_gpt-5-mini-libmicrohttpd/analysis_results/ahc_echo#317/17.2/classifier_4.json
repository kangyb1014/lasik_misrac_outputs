  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in typical usage: the call to MHD_destroy_response(response) simply destroys/frees the response object and does not call ahc_echo. Thus, as written there is no direct or indirect self-call. A violation would occur only if the implementation of MHD_destroy_response (or any function it calls) were to invoke ahc_echo (for example, by synchronously triggering the connection handler or event loop that calls ahc_echo again), which would create an indirect recursive call chain. There is no evidence of that in the provided code."
