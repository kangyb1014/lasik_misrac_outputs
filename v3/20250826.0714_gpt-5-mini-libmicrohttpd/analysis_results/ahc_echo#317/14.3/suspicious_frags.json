  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two if-statements above contain controlling expressions and should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant in the intended execution context. Other code fragments do not present controlling expressions that could be invariant: declarations (static int aptr), parameter casts, the unused-variable (void) casts, the assignment *req_cls = NULL, the calls to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, and the return ret; are not selection/iteration controlling expressions and therefore are not subject to Rule 14.3. There are no loop constructs in the function (no for/while/do-while) that would require checking for permitted invariant infinite-loop exceptions."
