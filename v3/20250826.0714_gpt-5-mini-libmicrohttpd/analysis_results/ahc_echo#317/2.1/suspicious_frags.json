  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function is provably unreachable: all return statements are conditional (dependent on runtime values such as method and *req_cls), so the subsequent statements can be reached for some inputs. The (void) casts are intentionally used to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not create unreachable code. The comparison &aptr != *req_cls reads the stored pointer value and does not dereference it; the branch that sets *req_cls = &aptr and returns can be taken or not depending on the caller-provided state, so the code that follows (resetting *req_cls, creating/queuing/destroying the response and returning ret) is reachable in other executions. Therefore there are no fragments that are statically unreachable and needing investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
