True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code passes param->response_page (a non-const char* member) as a read-only buffer to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static. Since the buffer is used only for reading (created from strlen and queued as response) the pointer should be const-qualified (e.g. const char *response_page) to avoid allowing modification. Thus this use violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A fix is to declare param->response_page as const char * (or ensure the API takes const void *), so the pointer is const-qualified whenever possible.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s finding is plausible but cannot be confirmed from the code shown. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified when they are used only for reading. In the snippet the member param->response_page is only read (strlen and passed to the response-creation function), so if that struct member is declared as char * (non-const) then it would be a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. However the definition of struct handler_param is not provided, nor is the prototype of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static shown. If response_page is already declared as const char * (or the MHD API already accepts a const void *), then there is no violation. Conversely, if response_page is non-const and the MHD API requires a non-const pointer, the code may still be forced to use non-const (or to cast away const), which is a separate API-compatibility issue but would still indicate the struct member could/should be made const if it is immutable.\n\nConclusion: the report may be correct in principle, but cannot be verified from the provided excerpt. To confirm, inspect the declaration of struct handler_param and the MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static prototype. If handler_param::response_page is non-const and never modified, change it to const char * (or use an API that accepts const) to satisfy Rule 8.13."
