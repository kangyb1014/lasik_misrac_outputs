  "explanation": "Only the two fragments above invoke string handling functions from <string.h> (strcmp and strlen) and therefore potentially can read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. No other calls to <string.h> functions appear in the function. The remaining statements are pointer comparisons, assignments, casts to void to suppress warnings, calls to libmicrohttpd API functions, and control-flow/return statements; none invoke string.h routines and so do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for this specific rule."
