  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The if (1) tests in the reported branches are constant-true runtime operations that serve only to introduce a block; evaluating that condition and branching is executed but has no effect on program behaviour. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour is dead code, so these if (1) constructs violate the rule. The intended purpose (muting an \"unused variable\" warning) should be achieved without an executed redundant test \u2014 e.g. remove the if (1) and just use a scoped block ({}), or better cast the unused variable to void ((void)res) after assignment, or otherwise use a non-executed mechanism to suppress the warning."
