  "explanation": "No function parameter itself is modified in this code. The pointer parameter 'connection' is never reassigned, incremented, or passed by address to allow modification of the pointer variable (no occurrences of 'connection =', 'connection +=', 'connection++', '&connection', or similar). The enum parameter 'info_type' is only used in the switch and not altered. All assignments target members of the object pointed to by 'connection' (for example connection->connection_info_dummy.*, memcpy into connection->connection_info_dummy.client_addr, and assigning connection->connection_info_dummy.tls_session = connection->tls_session). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted; only modifying the pointer parameter itself is forbidden. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and no fragments require further investigation under this rule."
