  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The two lines \u201c(void) url; (void) version;\u201d are the common, intentional idiom to mark parameters as used to suppress \"unused parameter\" diagnostics. MISRA Rule 2.2 aims at truly dead code \u2014 operations that are executed and whose removal would not affect program behaviour in a way that indicates a latent fault or unnecessary code path. In practice the (void)-casts are a deliberate source-level annotation (and in some contexts affect diagnostics or maintainability) and are an accepted way to document intentionally unused parameters. They are not the kind of dead code that Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid, so agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
