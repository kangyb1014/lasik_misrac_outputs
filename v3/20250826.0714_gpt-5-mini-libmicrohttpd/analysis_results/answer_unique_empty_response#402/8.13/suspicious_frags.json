  "explanation": "I did not include the const-qualified pointer parameters (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) because they are already const and therefore not relevant to Rule 8.13. I also did not include non-pointer declarations or uses (e.g. the static int marker, enum MHD_Result ret) because Rule 8.13 applies to pointer target const-qualification; those items are not pointer types. Some pointers in this function are part of the external MHD callback API (for example the connection and req_cls parameters) and may be required by the API signature; they are nevertheless listed above for investigation to determine whether a const qualification could be applied without breaking the API. Other calls that manipulate or pass response objects (MHD_create_response_*, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) were not listed because the API likely requires non-const pointers for those operations, but the local declaration of the response pointer (struct MHD_Response *r;) is included for review in case a const qualification is appropriate."
