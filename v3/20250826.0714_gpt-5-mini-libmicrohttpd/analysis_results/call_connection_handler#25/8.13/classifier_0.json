  "scenario": "The local pointer 'daemon' is declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;' but is only used for reading fields (accessing daemon->default_handler and daemon->default_handler_cls) and not to modify the pointed object. It could be declared 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;' to indicate immutability. Therefore the code does not qualify the pointer-to-object as const when possible."
