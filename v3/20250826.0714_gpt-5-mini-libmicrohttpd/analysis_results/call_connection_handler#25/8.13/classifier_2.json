  "scenario": "Not violated based on the shown fragment: the code only reads connection->rp.response and does not attempt to modify the pointed-to object. Rule 8.13 applies to pointer declarations, which are not shown here. Therefore you cannot conclude a violation from this usage alone. A concrete violation scenario would be if the member is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. \"char *response\") even though the pointed data is never modified anywhere \u2014 it should instead be declared as a const-qualified pointer (e.g. \"const char *response\")."
