  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter 'connection' is not reassigned or otherwise modified as a pointer anywhere in the function (no statements like 'connection = ...', pointer arithmetic on 'connection', or passing 'connection' to functions that change the pointer itself). The code does write to members of *connection (e.g. connection->rq.client_aware, connection->in_access_handler, connection->rq.client_context via &connection->rq.client_context), but MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 explicitly permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. The local variable 'daemon' is initialized from connection->daemon (a read), and 'processed' is a local variable \u2014 neither alters the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under Rule 17.8."
