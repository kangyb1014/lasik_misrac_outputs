  "explanation": "No direct calls to any functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) appear in this function, so there are no immediate violations within this fragment itself. The lines that are not flagged are simple checks and assignments (NULL != connection->rp.response, processed = 0, connection->rq.client_aware = true, connection->in_access_handler = true/false) and the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR macro invocation (which uses string literals, not <string.h> functions). The only code that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by string functions is the call to the application callback (daemon->default_handler) because it receives pointers to string/byte objects from the connection (connection->rq.url, connection->rq.method, connection->rq.version). Those arguments \u2014 and the callback invocation as a whole \u2014 must be investigated to ensure any subsequent use of <string.h> functions does not access beyond the objects\u2019 bounds. No other fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 21.17."
