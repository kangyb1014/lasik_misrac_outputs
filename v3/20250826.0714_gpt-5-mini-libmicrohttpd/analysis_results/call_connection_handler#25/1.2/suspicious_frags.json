  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The backslash used in the string literal is a standard C source line-splicing/adjacent-string usage (standard translation phases), not a compiler extension.\n- Use of true is the standard C boolean literal when stdbool.h is used; nothing in this fragment shows a compiler-only boolean keyword or extension.\n- All constructs (static function, struct pointer/member access, function-pointer call via daemon->default_handler, macros invoked like CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR and _()) are valid standard C usages and not inherently compiler extensions.\n\nGiven the fragment, there are no explicit compiler-documented language extensions to report for investigation."
