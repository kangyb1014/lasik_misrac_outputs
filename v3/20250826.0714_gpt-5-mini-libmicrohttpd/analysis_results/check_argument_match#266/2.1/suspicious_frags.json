  "explanation": "The fragments selected cover control-flow points that can lead to code being effectively unreachable (the function as a whole if the static function is never referenced, conditional early return after the external call, the loop/body that depends on runtime data, the post-loop conditional return, and the final return). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: simple declarations (struct/enum/local variables) and the two straightforward initializations of param are not themselves unreachable code; the call expression assigning ret is an external function call whose possible return paths are already represented by the checked conditional (and so investigation should focus on the conditional outcome rather than the call statement itself); there are no hidden goto/label constructs or subsequent statements after unconditional returns outside the listed fragments that would create additional unreachable code. Therefore only the listed control-flow fragments warrant further investigation for potential unreachable code."
