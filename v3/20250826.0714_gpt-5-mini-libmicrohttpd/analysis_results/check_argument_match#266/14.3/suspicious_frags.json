  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are syntactically invariant constants. The conditionals and loop depend on runtime values: - if (MHD_NO == ret) depends on the variable ret returned by MHD_parse_arguments_. - for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next) uses the pointer pos and its next field, both runtime values. - if (MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND != pos->kind) depends on pos->kind. - if (0 != param.num_headers) depends on param.num_headers, which is modified by MHD_parse_arguments_ and in the preceding loop. None of these controlling expressions is a compile-time constant or otherwise invariant, so there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
