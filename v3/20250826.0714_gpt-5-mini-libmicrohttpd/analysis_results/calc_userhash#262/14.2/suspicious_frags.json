  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loop constructs are present in the provided code fragment. Rule 14.2 specifically applies to for statements and their three clauses (initialization, test, and iteration expressions) and to loop counters/flags used therein. The function contains only: a function header, assertions (mhd_assert), and calls to digest_update, digest_update_with_colon, and digest_calc_hash \u2014 none of which are for statements or contain loop clauses in this fragment.\n\nNote: If any of the called functions or macros (e.g. mhd_assert, digest_update, digest_update_with_colon, digest_calc_hash) themselves contain for statements, those for loops must be inspected in their own definitions. However, those definitions are not part of the given code fragment, so there are no for-loop occurrences here to investigate for Rule 14.2."
