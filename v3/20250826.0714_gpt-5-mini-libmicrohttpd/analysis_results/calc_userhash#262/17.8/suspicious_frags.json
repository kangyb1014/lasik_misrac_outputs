  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function, so there is no direct violation of Rule 17.8. Details:\n- 'da' is only dereferenced (da->hashing) and passed to helper functions; the pointer 'da' itself is not reassigned.\n- 'username' and 'realm' are declared as const char * and are only passed to digest_update; the pointers are not modified.\n- 'username_len' and 'realm_len' are passed by value and not changed.\n- 'digest_bin' (uint8_t *) is passed to digest_calc_hash; the object it points to may be modified by that call, which is allowed by the rule, but the pointer 'digest_bin' itself is not altered in this function.\nTherefore, no fragments in this function need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
