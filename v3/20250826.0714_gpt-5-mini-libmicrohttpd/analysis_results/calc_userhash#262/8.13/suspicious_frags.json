  ],
  "explanation": "I did not mark any other fragments because they do not present non-const pointer types that could violate Rule 8.13: username and realm are already const-qualified (const char *username, const char *realm) and thus conform to the rule; the size parameters are value types (size_t) not pointers; the body statements (mhd_assert, digest_update, digest_update_with_colon, digest_calc_hash) are usages of those parameters rather than additional pointer declarations. The only pointer parameters in the function that lack const qualification are the two listed fragments and should be investigated to determine whether they could/should be const-qualified."
