  "explanation": "I have listed every call expression present in calc_userhash. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 prohibits direct or indirect self-calls; the only places that could cause indirect recursion are function (or macro) calls. Therefore each call site in this function must be investigated to determine whether that callee (directly or through a chain) calls back to calc_userhash. The remaining fragments (function signature, parameter declarations, braces, and the surrounding non-call expressions) contain no function-call sites and thus cannot by themselves introduce direct or indirect recursion, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.2."
