  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, switch, for, while, do-while) appear in the provided function body, so there are no candidate invariant controlling expressions to inspect for Rule 14.3. The only expressions that might look like conditions are the two mhd_assert(...) calls, but each assertion uses function parameters/structure members (NULL != username and ! da->hashing) and therefore are not invariant compile-time expressions. The other statements are calls to digest_update, digest_update_with_colon and digest_calc_hash (no visible control constructs). Macro expansions are not available in this snippet; based on the source shown, there are no invariant controlling expressions to investigate."
