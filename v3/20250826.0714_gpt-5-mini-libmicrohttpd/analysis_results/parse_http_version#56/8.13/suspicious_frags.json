  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters and pointer variables are:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection *connection: this pointer is used to modify connection->rq.http_ver and is passed to transmit_error_response_static, so it must be a pointer to a non-const type and cannot be const-qualified.\n- const char *http_string: already points to a const-qualified type, satisfying the rule.\n- const char *const h = http_string: local alias is a const pointer to const char, satisfying the rule.\n\nThere are no other pointer variables in the function (no char* buffers or mutable pointer parameters) that could or should be const-qualified. Indexing into h uses a const-qualified pointer. Therefore nothing in this function violates or needs further investigation under Rule 8.13."
