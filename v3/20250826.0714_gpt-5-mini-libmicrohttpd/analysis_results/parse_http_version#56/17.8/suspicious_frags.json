  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Details:\n- The pointer parameter 'connection' is used only to modify the object it points to (connection->rq.http_ver) and to pass the pointer to other functions. Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; the pointer itself is not reassigned anywhere in the function.\n- The pointer parameter 'http_string' is aliased to a local const pointer (const char *const h = http_string). Neither 'http_string' nor the local alias 'h' is modified, and no write-through to the pointed-to characters occurs (they are treated as const).\n- The non-pointer parameter 'len' is only read (compared) and never assigned to.\n- There are no statements such as connection = ..., http_string = ..., len = ..., or pointer increments/decrements that would modify parameter variables.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be investigated further with respect to that rule."
