  "explanation": "The function contains no explicit control-flow constructs that syntactically create unreachable code (no return/goto/break/continue that would skip later statements, no infinite loops). The only potential sources of unreachable code are the external calls/macros which might not return normally (for example, if MHD_destroy_response or free were implemented as a macro that invokes longjmp/exit/return-from-caller). Therefore the calls and the statements immediately following them are flagged for investigation. Other fragments (variable declarations, the for-loop header, the conditional tests, and simple assignments) are standard reachable constructs: the for-loop body being skipped when num_resps == 0 is normal conditional execution, not unreachable code, and the assignments that set pointers/ counters to zero/NULL are reachable unless an earlier called routine does not return (which is already covered by the flagged call sites). No other lines in the function present syntactic unreachable-code patterns, so they do not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
