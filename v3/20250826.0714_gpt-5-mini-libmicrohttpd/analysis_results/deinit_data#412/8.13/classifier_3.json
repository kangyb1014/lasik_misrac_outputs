  "scenario": "The single statement body_dyn = NULL; simply stores a null pointer value into the variable. This assignment does not itself violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (which concerns whether a pointer type should be const-qualified). There is no evidence in the shown fragment of the declaration of body_dyn; if the declaration omitted a possible const qualification (i.e. body_dyn could be declared as pointer to const but is not), that would be a separate violation in the declaration, but not caused by this assignment. Inspect the declaration of body_dyn to determine if it should be a pointer to const."
