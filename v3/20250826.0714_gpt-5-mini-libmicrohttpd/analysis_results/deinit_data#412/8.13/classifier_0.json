  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment: freeing dynamically allocated memory via a non-const pointer is appropriate. The rule (8.13) concerns pointer declarations (they should be const-qualified where possible), but the shown code only calls free(body_dyn) and then NULLs it \u2014 this does not itself violate 8.13. A true violation would be if the pointer was declared non-const even though it only ever points to immutable data (it should have been declared as pointer-to-const), or conversely if body_dyn were declared const and then freed by casting away const (which would introduce other MISRA violations)."
