  "scenario": "Assigning NULL to resp_single does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A violation would occur if resp_single is declared as a pointer to a non-const type while only read-only access is required. For example, if resp_single is declared as:\n\n  struct MHD_Response *resp_single;\n\nand the code never modifies the pointed-to object through resp_single (only reads it), then it should be declared as:\n\n  const struct MHD_Response *resp_single;\n\nIn that case the current non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13. With only the fragment shown (resp_single = NULL;) there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 violation."
