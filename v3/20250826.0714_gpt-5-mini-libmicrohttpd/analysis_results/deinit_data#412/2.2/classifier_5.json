  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of deinit_data:\n```c\nstatic void\ndeinit_data (void)\n{\n  if (NULL != resp_single)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resp_single);\n  resp_single = NULL;\n  if (NULL != resps)\n  {\n    unsigned int i;\n    for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)\n      MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n    num_resps = 0;\n    free (resps);\n  }\n  resps = NULL;\n  if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    free (body_dyn);\n  body_dyn = NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nresps = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment 'resps = NULL;' is not dead code. When resps was non-NULL the function frees the memory; the subsequent assignment clears the pointer to avoid a dangling pointer. Removing that assignment could change program behaviour (leave a dangling pointer and cause later use-after-free). Even though the assignment is a no-op if resps was already NULL, its presence is required for the case where resps was freed, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
