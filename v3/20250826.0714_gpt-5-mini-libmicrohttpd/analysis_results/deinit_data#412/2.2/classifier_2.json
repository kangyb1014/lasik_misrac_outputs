  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of deinit_data:\n```c\nstatic void\ndeinit_data (void)\n{\n  if (NULL != resp_single)\n    MHD_destroy_response (resp_single);\n  resp_single = NULL;\n  if (NULL != resps)\n  {\n    unsigned int i;\n    for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)\n      MHD_destroy_response (resps[i]);\n    num_resps = 0;\n    free (resps);\n  }\n  resps = NULL;\n  if (NULL != body_dyn)\n    free (body_dyn);\n  body_dyn = NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nbody_dyn = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment body_dyn = NULL; clears a pointer after a potential free to avoid a dangling pointer and to allow later code to detect that the buffer has been released (same pattern is used for resp_single/resps). Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (subsequent checks of body_dyn would no longer reliably indicate that the memory has been freed), so the statement is not dead code. (Only if body_dyn were a local variable that is not used after deinit_data would the assignment be dead; based on the shown pattern it is clearly intended as a global/state-reset and thus is not dead.)"
