  "explanation": "I scanned the provided deinit_data function for any use of the Standard C string.h routines listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). None of these functions (or any other string.h functions) appear in the code fragment. The function only calls MHD_destroy_response and free, checks pointers against NULL, and iterates over an array with a for loop; those operations do not involve string.h routines and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for possible out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses of objects via string.h functions under Rule 21.17."
