  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the pointer parameter itself (i.e., assigning to the parameter variable c). In this function there are no assignments to c (no statements like \u201cc = \u2026\u201d), no code that takes the address of the parameter variable and writes through it, and no parameter passed by value that is reassigned. All assignments operate on the object pointed to by c (members such as c->keepalive, c->event_loop_info, c->rq, c->rp, c->write_buffer, c->read_buffer, etc.), which is explicitly permitted by the rule. The mhd_assert calls only read fields of c and do not assign to c. The call to MHD_pool_allocate stores its result into a member (c->read_buffer) rather than into c itself. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for a Rule 17.8 violation."
