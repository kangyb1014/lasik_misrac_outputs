  "explanation": "I examined the provided function MHD_connection_set_initial_state_. There are no calls to memcmp, no string comparisons, and no operations that compare or rely on null-terminated strings. The code only contains assertions, assignments, memset calls, and a pool allocation. None of these use the Standard Library function memcmp or perform string comparisons on null-terminated strings, so there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the codebase or in called functions (e.g., MHD_pool_allocate), those locations would need to be reviewed separately, but they are not present in the supplied code fragment."
