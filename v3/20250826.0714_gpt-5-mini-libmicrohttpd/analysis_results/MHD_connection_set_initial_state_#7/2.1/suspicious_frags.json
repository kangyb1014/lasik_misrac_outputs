  "explanation": "No unreachable-code patterns were found in the provided function. Specifically:\n\n- There are no early returns, goto statements, breaks, continues, infinite loops, or label-only sections preceding other statements that would render subsequent code unreachable. Execution flows straight from the function entry through each statement.\n\n- The #ifdef/#endif block only conditionally includes assertions; conditional compilation itself does not create unreachable code in the compiled translation unit (it either includes the assertions or omits them). There is no else or #if 0 region that would leave code after an unconditional jump unreachable.\n\n- The mhd_assert calls are not followed by control-flow-affecting constructs within this function. Typical assert-like macros either compile to a no-op or to a runtime check that may abort, but they do not introduce unreachable statements in the source form shown here. Even if an assertion aborts at runtime in some builds, that does not make the subsequent code syntactically unreachable in the compiled unit for other builds.\n\n- All assignments, memset calls, and the allocation call are sequential and reachable when the function executes. There is no dead code (statements that can never be executed under any build configuration represented in this snippet).\n\n- The line continuation (backslash) in the mhd_assert is a preprocessor continuation and does not produce unreachable code.\n\nTherefore, within this function snippet there are no fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 for unreachable code."
