  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains two if statements and a conditional (?:) operator, all of which depend on runtime values:\n- if (tool_params.all_cpus) \u2014 depends on the runtime state of tool_params.all_cpus, not an invariant.\n- if (0 != tool_params.threads) \u2014 depends on the runtime state of tool_params.threads, not an invariant.\n- return '-' == param_name[1] ? ... \u2014 the ternary controlling expression depends on the function parameter param_name[1], not an invariant.\nThere are no loops in this function; therefore the provided exceptions for infinite loops or do-while constant expressions are not applicable. The assignment tool_params.thread_per_conn = ! 0; sets a constant value but is not a controlling expression and so is outside the scope of Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
