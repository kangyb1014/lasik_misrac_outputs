  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains only the declaration/closing braces and the fprintf calls embedded in the shown conditional blocks; there is no other code after an unconditional return that would be unreachable. The only locations where unreachable code could arise (for this routine) are the conditional early returns and the final assignment/return sequence \u2014 these fragments are therefore reported for investigation to determine whether any of the conditions can be statically true for all inputs (making later statements unreachable) or otherwise produce dead code. No other fragments in the function present evidence of unreachable code (there are no unreachable statements following unconditional jumps, no duplicate/never-taken branches outside the reported fragments)."
