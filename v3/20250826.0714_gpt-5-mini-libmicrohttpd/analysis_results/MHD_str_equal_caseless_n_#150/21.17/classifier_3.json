  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Violation: if str1 points to a buffer smaller than maxlen (for example a 2-byte buffer containing {'A','B'} with no further storage) and str2 is at least maxlen bytes long with matching leading bytes, the loop will reach i==2 and execute str1[2] which is beyond the bounds of the object. Because the code reads str1[i] unconditionally before any check on str2 or bounds, this can produce an out-of-bounds access, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
