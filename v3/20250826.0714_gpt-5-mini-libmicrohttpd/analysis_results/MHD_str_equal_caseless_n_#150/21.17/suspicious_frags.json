  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not perform pointer dereferences or indexed accesses that could read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by the pointer parameters, nor do they call any of the <string.h> functions listed in Rule 21.17. Specifically: the function signature and the variable declaration (size_t i) merely declare parameters and local storage; the call to charsequalcaseless operates on already-copied char values (c1 and c2) and does not perform further pointer indexing; the conditional and return statements that follow only use these local char values; and the final return statement returns a boolean constant. Therefore those parts need not be investigated for out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17."
