  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The fragment uses only standard C constructs: a normal function definition, pointer types with const qualifiers (const char *const), the standard size_t type, a standard for loop, local char variables, array indexing, a plain function call (charsequalcaseless), comparisons against integer constant 0, and return statements (including the idiomatic but standard expression return ! 0). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembler, compiler-specific keywords, builtins, or pragmas. Therefore no code fragments need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
