  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible. In this function: \n- The function parameters are declared as const char *const str1 and const char *const str2 \u2014 the pointed-to type is const-qualified (const char), so the requirement is met. The extra const on the pointer itself makes the pointer value immutable, but that is not a violation.\n- There are no other pointer variables, no pointer casts, and no pointer-to-non-const conversions in the body. Indexing (str1[i], str2[i]) performs read-only access through const-qualified pointers.\n- Local variables c1 and c2 are plain char copies of the characters read; they are not pointers and thus outside the scope of Rule 8.13.\n- The call to charsequalcaseless passes char values, not pointers.\n\nBecause all pointers in this code already point to const-qualified types and no pointer-related operations violate the rule, there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
