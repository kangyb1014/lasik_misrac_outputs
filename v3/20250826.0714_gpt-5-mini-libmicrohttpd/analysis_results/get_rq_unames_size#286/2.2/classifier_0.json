  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_rq_unames_size:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline size_t\nget_rq_unames_size (const struct MHD_RqDAuth *params,\n                    enum MHD_DigestAuthUsernameType uname_type)\n{\n  size_t s;\n\n  mhd_assert (get_rq_uname_type (params) == uname_type);\n  s = 0;\n  if ((MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD == uname_type) ||\n      (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == uname_type) )\n  {\n    s += params->username.value.len + 1; /* Add one byte for zero-termination */\n    if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == uname_type)\n      s += (params->username.value.len + 1) / 2;\n  }\n  else if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_EXTENDED == uname_type)\n    s += params->username_ext.value.len\n         - MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN + 1; /* Add one byte for zero-termination */\n  return s;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ns = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment s = 0; is required to initialise s for the case where none of the subsequent branches execute (i.e. uname_type is not STANDARD, USERHASH or EXTENDED). Removing it would leave s indeterminate and could change program behaviour (undefined behaviour) or return a garbage value. The assertion does not guarantee that one of those branches will execute. Therefore the assignment is not dead code."
