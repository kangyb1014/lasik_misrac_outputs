  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C: - function with a storage class specifier (static) and enum return type; - const char * parameter; - if statements and fprintf calls; - adjacent string literal concatenation across lines (standard C); - logical negation of an integer literal (! 0) which is standard C and yields 1; - assignment to a struct/member (tool_params.tiny = ! 0) using standard member access; - array indexing and character literal comparison (param_name[1] == '-') and the conditional (?:) operator. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({:}), inline asm, nested functions, or compiler builtins. The identifier containing a double underscore (process_param__tiny) is reserved for the implementation by the C standard but is not a compiler language extension per se; Rule 1.2 per your instruction applies only to documented compiler language extensions, so this does not trigger reporting. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
