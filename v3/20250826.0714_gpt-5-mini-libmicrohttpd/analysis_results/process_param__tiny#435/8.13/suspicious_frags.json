  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n\n- The only pointer declared in this function is the parameter: const char *param_name. It already points to a const-qualified type, complying with Rule 8.13.\n- The use param_name[1] reads through the const-qualified pointer and does not attempt to modify the pointed-to object.\n- The calls to fprintf use param_name as a string argument; the standard library expects a pointer to const char for %s, and these are uses of library interfaces rather than declarations in this translation unit \u2014 there is no locally declared non-const pointer to investigate.\n- There are no other pointer declarations, pointer assignments, casts, or returns of pointer types in the provided code fragment (tool_params members are accessed as scalars and not shown as pointers here).\n\nBecause every pointer occurrence in the provided code either is already const-qualified or is a standard library object/usage outside the scope of this function, there are no fragments requiring further investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
