  "explanation": "I found no use of memcmp or any wrapper around memcmp in the provided function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 specifically prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In this code: (1) there are only boolean flag checks (tool_params.empty/medium/large) and assignments (tool_params.tiny = ! 0); (2) string handling is limited to passing param_name to fprintf (formatting), which is not a memcmp-based comparison; and (3) the only character comparison is ' '-' == param_name[1]' \u2014 an indexed char comparison, not a call to memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
