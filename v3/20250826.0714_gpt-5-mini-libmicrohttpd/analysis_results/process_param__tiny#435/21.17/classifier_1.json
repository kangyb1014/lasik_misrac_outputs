  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code fragment uses fprintf with the \"%s\" format specifier (a stdio function), not any of the <string.h> functions listed by Rule 21.17. Therefore Rule 21.17 does not apply. (Note: if param_name were not NUL-terminated, printing it would cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read / undefined behavior, but that concern is not covered by Rule 21.17.)"
