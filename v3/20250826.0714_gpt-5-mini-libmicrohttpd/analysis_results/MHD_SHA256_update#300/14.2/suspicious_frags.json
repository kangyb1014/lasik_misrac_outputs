  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No 'for' statements are present in the provided function implementation \u2014 only conditionals (if) and a while loop. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 specifically constrains the form of for statements, so there are no in-function code fragments subject to that rule to investigate here. \n\nNotes to reviewers: \n- The while loop and the if/else constructs are not relevant to Rule 14.2 (they are not for statements). \n- There are no macros or code tokens in this function that expand to a for statement (no 'for' token appears in the function text shown), so there is no hidden for-loop to inspect in this snippet. \n- Functions called from this routine (sha256_transform, memcpy) could themselves contain for loops; those would be in separate translation units and need to be inspected independently if Rule 14.2 compliance of those loops is required."
