  "explanation": "The only pointer in the provided code is the parameter 'const uint8_t *data', which is already const-qualified and is only read (data[0], data[i]) \u2014 this satisfies MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointers (no pointer returns, no pointer assignments, no casts of pointers, and no calls shown that accept 'data' as a non-const pointer) in the fragment that would require investigation. The rotate macro/function _MHD_ROTL32 is used with integer types and not shown to operate on pointers in the given code, so there is no evidence here of a pointer that should be const-qualified. Therefore no code fragments in this snippet need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
