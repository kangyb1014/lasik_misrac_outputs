  "explanation": "Other fragments of the function (the signature and linkage specifier, the local declaration `uint32_t hash;`, and the final `return hash;`) are straightforward, reachable in normal control flow, and do not by themselves indicate unreachable code. The only control-flow constructs that can produce unreachable code are the conditional and the loop; those constructs (the if/else and the for loop and the assignment of the first element) are included above for investigation. There are no other branches, labels, or statements in this function that could be statically identified as unreachable without additional context (for example, callers or macro expansion of _MHD_ROTL32), so no other fragments require investigation for Rule 2.1."
