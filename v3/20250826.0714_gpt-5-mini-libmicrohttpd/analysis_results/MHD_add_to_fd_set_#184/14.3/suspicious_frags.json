  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (if, switch, for, while, do-while). The three if-statements above are the only controlling statements in this function and therefore are the only fragments that could be invariant and require investigation. Other parts of the code are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3: the preprocessor #ifndef/#endif is compile-time conditional (not a C controlling expression), the assignments and macro invocations (including MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_) are ordinary expressions/statements, and the final return expression is not a control-flow governing expression. There are no loops in this function (so the allowed infinite-loop/do-while exception does not apply here). Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
