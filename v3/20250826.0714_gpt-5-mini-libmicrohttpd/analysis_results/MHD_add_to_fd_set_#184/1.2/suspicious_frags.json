  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The source contains only standard C constructs: function definition and parameters, standard preprocessor conditional (#ifndef/#endif), casts ((int) FD_SETSIZE), use of fd_set and FD_SETSIZE (standard/POSIX macros), simple macro calls (MHD_SCKT_FD_FITS_FDSET_SETSIZE_, MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_), and ordinary operators (including the unusual but standard expression `! 0`).\n\nThere are no visible occurrences of recognized compiler-specific extensions that must be reported for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, such as: __attribute__, __asm / asm, __builtin_... tokens, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, computed gotos or label-as-value extensions, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n\nNote: the MHD_... macros and the types/constants (MHD_socket, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, MHD_SCKT_...) are user-defined; if their definitions (not provided here) expand to compiler-specific extensions, those definitions should be inspected. However, based solely on the presented code fragment, there are no explicit language extensions to report."
