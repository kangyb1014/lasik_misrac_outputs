First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements appear anywhere in the provided function body \u2014 only if statements, assignments, macro invocations, and returns. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 targets for loops specifically, so there are no explicit for-loop fragments here to inspect. The only possible locations where a for loop could be present are inside the two invoked macros (MHD_SCKT_FD_FITS_FDSET_SETSIZE_ and MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_), which are not expanded in this snippet; therefore those macro invocations are flagged for investigation. All other code lines (parameter checks, #ifndef block, assignments, comparison/update of max_fd, and return statements) do not contain for statements or related loop-counter usage and so do not need to be investigated for Rule 14.2."
