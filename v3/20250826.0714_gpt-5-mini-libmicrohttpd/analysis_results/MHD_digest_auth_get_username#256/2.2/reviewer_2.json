  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \"(void) used;\" is an executed expression statement with no side effects; removing it does not change the run\u2011time behaviour of the program. Under the Rule 2.2 definition \u2014 \"Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\" \u2014 this is dead code. The presence of mhd_assert earlier explains the situation: when asserts are compiled out, \"used\" becomes otherwise unused and the only remaining reference is the void cast, which is a no\u2011op at run time. (Note: this is a common idiom to suppress compiler warnings and can be addressed by a documented deviation or by alternative approaches, but strictly speaking it violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
