  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the function do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the variable 'params' is already a pointer to a const-qualified type, so it satisfies the rule; 'uname_strct' is a local structure whose address is passed for output and therefore must be a modifiable object (cannot be const); the code uses dynamically allocated writable storage (via MHD_calloc_) which, when intended to be returned to the caller for modification or freeing, appropriately uses a non-const pointer; temporary variables, assertions, and the use of 'used' to mute warnings are not pointer-type issues relevant to Rule 8.13. These parts therefore do not require further investigation for const-qualification concerns."
