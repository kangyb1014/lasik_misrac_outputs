  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that require investigation for Rule 17.2. Reasons:\n- The function post_iterator does not call itself anywhere (no direct recursive call).\n- There are no calls via function pointers or indirect call sites in this snippet (no function-pointer dereference or invocation, no callbacks invoked). The only functions called are standard library/runtime calls (strcmp, fprintf, memcpy) which do not call user-defined post_iterator, so no indirect recursion is possible from them in this context.\n- No global or static structures in this snippet hold function pointers that are invoked here; the cls parameter is only used as data (cast to struct Request*) and is not called.\n- MHD_YES is an enum/constant return value, not a function call.\n\nGiven the above, there is no evidence of direct or indirect recursion in the provided code fragment, so no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 17.2."
