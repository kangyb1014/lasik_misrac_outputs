  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for uses of memcmp (the target of MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14). No occurrence of memcmp is present. The code compares null-terminated strings using strcmp (e.g. 0 == strcmp(\"DONE\", key), 0 == strcmp(\"v1\", key), 0 == strcmp(\"v2\", key)), which is the correct string-comparison API for null-terminated strings and is not disallowed by Rule 21.14. There are uses of memcpy and manual NUL-termination when copying form data, but these do not involve memcmp or compare null-terminated strings and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.14. Consequently, there are no code fragments to flag for investigation under this specific rule."
