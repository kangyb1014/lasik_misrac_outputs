  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code as code whose removal would not affect the program behaviour at run time. The statements like (void) content_type; are the established idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused; they do not change runtime behaviour but they do convey intent and suppress compiler diagnostics. MISRA's concern in Rule 2.2 is with code that is redundant in the executed program (and which could hide logic errors), not with source-level annotations used to document intent or suppress warnings. If you prefer to avoid these no-op casts you can (a) omit the parameter name in the function signature, (b) use a project-wide UNUSED/ATTRIBUTE macro, or (c) use a compiler-specific attribute, but the presence of (void) content_type; itself should not be treated as a Rule 2.2 violation."
