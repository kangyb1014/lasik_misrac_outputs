  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. The statements like (void) transfer_encoding; are the standard, intentional no-op idiom to silence \"unused parameter\" warnings \u2014 they are present solely to document/acknowledge that the parameter is intentionally unused. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets truly dead code (redundant computations, unreachable leftovers, or operations whose removal would constitute latent faults or change behaviour). In practice and in MISRA usage this explicit cast-to-void is the accepted way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter; static analysers and MISRA guidance treat that pattern as a benign annotation rather than a defect to be removed. If a project toolchain enforces 2.2 strictly, alternatives are to use a dedicated UNUSED(x) macro or a compiler/annotation mechanism, or refactor the API so the parameter is not present \u2014 but the presence of the (void) expression itself is not a correct violation report for Rule 2.2."
