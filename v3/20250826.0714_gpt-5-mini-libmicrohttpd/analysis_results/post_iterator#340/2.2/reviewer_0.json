  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements like \u201c(void) filename;\u201d are executed no\u2011ops with no side effects; removing them does not change program behaviour (they only silence compiler warnings). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 any executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code, so these cast\u2011to\u2011void statements meet the definition of dead code. (Note: in extremely timing\u2011sensitive embedded code one could argue removal might change timing, but the intent and usual effect of these lines is a pure no\u2011op \u2014 therefore they violate Rule 2.2. Use alternatives such as omitting the parameter name, compiler-specific unused attributes, or other approved suppression mechanisms to avoid the warning without introducing executed no\u2011ops.)"
