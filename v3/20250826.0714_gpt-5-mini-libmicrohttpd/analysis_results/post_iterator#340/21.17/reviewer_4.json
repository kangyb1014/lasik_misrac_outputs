  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is correct as a potential MISRA 21.17 violation. The code calls strcmp(\"...\", key) without checking that key is non-NULL and NUL-terminated. strcmp (and other <string.h> routines) require valid pointers to NUL-terminated strings; passing a NULL pointer or a non-terminated buffer can lead to dereferencing NULL or reading beyond the bounds of the object, which would violate Rule 21.17. If, however, the surrounding API (the MHD callback contract) formally guarantees that key is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, then the calls are safe and there is no violation \u2014 but the posted code itself contains no such check, so the reported potential violation is valid under MISRA\u2019s requirements to avoid out-of-bounds accesses."
