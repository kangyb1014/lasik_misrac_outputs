  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments detected. Each conditional branch (strcmp against \"DONE\", \"v1\", and \"v2\") can be taken depending on the runtime value of key, and each contains an explicit return; the final fprintf/return is the fallback executed when none of those comparisons match. The (void) casts for unused parameters are executed statements (used to suppress unused-parameter warnings) and are not dead. There are no constant false or constant true conditions, no code following an unconditional jump that would be impossible to reach, and no duplicated or never-invoked blocks. Therefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code), there are no fragments in this function that require further investigation."
