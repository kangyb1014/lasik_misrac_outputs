  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is \"if (NULL == content)\" which depends on the parameter content and therefore is not an invariant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements whose controlling expressions are constant. The conditional operator used in the return statement (?:) is an ordinary expression and not a controlling expression for iteration/selection under MISRA Rule 14.3, so it does not trigger the rule. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
