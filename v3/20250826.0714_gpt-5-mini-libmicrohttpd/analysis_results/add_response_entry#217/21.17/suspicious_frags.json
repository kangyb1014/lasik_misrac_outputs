  "explanation": "The only operations that can perform out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via <string.h> in this function are the uses of the string-handling facilities. All other lines are not string operations and thus do not need investigation for Rule 21.17: - The function signature and local variable declarations simply declare types and do not access object bytes. - The NULL check (if (NULL == content) return MHD_NO;) is a defensive check that prevents a NULL content pointer from being used further in the function. - The final result expression only returns the outcome of add_response_entry_n; it is not itself a string operation (though the call passes pointers/lengths that need to be checked \u2014 those pointer/length uses are included in the suspicious fragments). No other calls to string.h functions appear in this snippet, so there are no additional places in this function to investigate for accesses beyond object bounds."
