  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in this function. The code uses only standard C constructs: enum return type, pointer parameters, size_t, NULL, strlen, the ternary operator, and a call to another function. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_..., typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, labels-as-values, Microsoft-specific keywords, vendor pragmas, or other non-standard keywords or operators. Therefore no fragments in this snippet require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
