  "explanation": "The only potential recursion risk in this function is the call to add_response_entry_n; investigators must check whether add_response_entry_n calls back to add_response_entry (directly or indirectly). There is no direct call to add_response_entry within this function body, so no direct recursion here. Other lines (NULL check for content, strlen calls, local size_t declarations, and the function signature itself) do not constitute function calls that could produce recursion and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2. Inspect add_response_entry_n and any functions it calls to determine if an indirect recursive cycle exists."
