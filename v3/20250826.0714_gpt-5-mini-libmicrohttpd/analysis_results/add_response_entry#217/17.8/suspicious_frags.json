  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The code only: (1) checks content for NULL, (2) computes header_len and content_len into local variables, and (3) passes the parameters to add_response_entry_n. There are no assignments, increments, or rebindings of response, kind, header, or content. Passing response (a pointer) to another function may allow modification of the pointed-to object, which is permitted by Rule 17.8; the pointer variable itself is not altered. header and content are const-qualified and are not modified. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
