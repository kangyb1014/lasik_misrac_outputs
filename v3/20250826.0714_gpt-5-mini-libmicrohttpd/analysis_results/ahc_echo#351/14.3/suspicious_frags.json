  "explanation": "Only conditional/controlling expressions can violate MISRA C Rule 14.3. In this function the only control expressions are the three if-statements and the ternary expression listed above; those are therefore the fragments that need investigation for invariance. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) in the function that could be invariant, and the remaining statements are either declarations, function calls, assignments, (void) casts to suppress unused warnings, or constant data \u2014 none of which are controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. Thus no other fragments require investigation for this rule."
