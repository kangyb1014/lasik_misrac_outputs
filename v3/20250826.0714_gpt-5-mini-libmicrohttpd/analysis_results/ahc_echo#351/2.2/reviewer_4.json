  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) param; statements are the common idiom to explicitly discard unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings. Although they are no-op expression statements, MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code (\u201cany operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour\u201d) is applied in the context of observable behaviour of the system (including timing per Note 1). More importantly, these casts serve an explicit purpose (documentation/suppressing diagnostics) and are intentional, so they are not considered illegal dead code in the sense intended by MISRA. If a project wanted to avoid such statements entirely, there are alternative, MISRA-compliant techniques (e.g. omit the parameter name in function definition where allowed, or use an approved macro/annotation), but that does not mean the current idiom violates Rule 2.2. Therefore the agent A report is incorrect."
