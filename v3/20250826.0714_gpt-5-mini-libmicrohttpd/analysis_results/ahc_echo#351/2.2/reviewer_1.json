  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The statement\n  (void) upload_data_size;\nis an expression statement that performs no observable action at runtime; removing it does not change program behaviour (only compiler diagnostics/warnings). Because it is reachable and executed but has no effect, it meets the rule's definition of dead code. The same reasoning applies to the other (void) parameter lines in the function. Recommendation: either remove the unused parameter names from the function signature (omit the identifier for unused parameters), or use a single, project\u2011approved mechanism for indicating intentionally unused parameters that is allowed by your project/MISRA deviation procedure."
