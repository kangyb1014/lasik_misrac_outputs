  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can lead to unreachable code and therefore warrant investigation: the function definition is declared static (a static function that is never referenced elsewhere in the translation unit yields unreachable code), the static sentinel already_called_marker together with the subsequent early-return if-block implement a call-state check that \u2014 depending on how req_cls is initialized/used by callers \u2014 can make the remainder of the function permanently unreachable, and the immediate return when response == NULL causes the subsequent authentication-response path to be skipped when response allocation fails. Other code fragments in the function were not selected because they are either: simple parameter void-casts to suppress warnings (these do not create unreachable code), local static const string declarations that are actually used later, normal conditional branches that are reachable depending on runtime state (e.g. the authentication-success path and the authentication-failure path are mutually exclusive but both reachable in different runs), or straightforward calls and cleanups (MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, returns at end of function) that do not constitute dead/unreachable code by themselves. If additional translation-unit context is provided (for example, whether ahc_echo is referenced/called anywhere), the static function suspicion can be confirmed or ruled out."
