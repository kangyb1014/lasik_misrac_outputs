If a caller supplies a non-terminated buffer (or an invalid pointer), strlen can read past the end of the object and thus violate Rule 21.17. 2) memcpy(nonce, nonce2, NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size)) copies a number of bytes derived from digest_size into the destination 'nonce' but the function signature provides no size for 'nonce'. If the caller supplies a buffer smaller than NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size), memcpy will write beyond the bounds of 'nonce' and violate Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A points to two uses of string.h functions: strlen(realm) and memcpy(nonce, nonce2, ...). Both are potential sources of out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses if their pointer arguments do not meet the function preconditions (realm must be a valid NUL\u2011terminated string, nonce must point to a buffer at least NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size) bytes long). However, from the code fragment alone there is no proof that these preconditions are violated; the function signature and surrounding code imply a contract that realm is a valid C string and that the caller supplies a nonce buffer of adequate size. MISRA C Rule 21.17 requires that uses of string.h functions shall not result in accesses beyond object bounds \u2014 this is a semantic requirement that can be satisfied by a documented/coded precondition or by checks inside the function. The fragment does not show internal checks, but that does not prove a rule violation unless the API contract (or callers) fail to guarantee those preconditions. Therefore the report is not correct as a definite MISRA 21.17 violation based solely on this fragment. It is, however, a valid caution: to be MISRA\u2011compliant the code must ensure (by contract, assertions, or explicit size parameters) that realm is NUL\u2011terminated and that nonce points to a sufficiently large buffer. Typical remedies are: add a nonce length parameter (or an assert/check), validate realm (or document/verify its origin), or use bounded APIs and checks so the rule can be statically/dynamically justified."
