  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. The call passes realm (declared const char *realm) and nonce2 (a mutable char array used as output). Pointer use here is appropriate: realm is const-qualified and immutable, nonce2 is non-const because it is written by the callee. Note: a violation would occur if calculate_add_nonce were declared to take a non-const pointer for realm (i.e., char *realm) even though it does not modify the pointed-to data, but nothing in the shown code indicates that."
