  "explanation": "The original source was truncated inside an fprintf call, causing a parse/compile failure. I closed and completed the fprintf format using the portable PRIu64 macro and finished the mhd_probe_log_fmt_u64 function. I also provided a sensible implementation of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry that preserves the intended retry-and-log behavior: it tries candidate nonces, logs attempts/candidates, checks for overflow, and returns a fallback if needed. No main() or macros were added, and the code now compiles."
