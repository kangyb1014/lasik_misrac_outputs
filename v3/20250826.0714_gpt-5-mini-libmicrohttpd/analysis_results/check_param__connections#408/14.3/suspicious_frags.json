  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (if/while/for/do-while). The only controlling constructs in this function are the two if statements listed above, so they must be examined for possible invariance. Other fragments in the function (the return statements, the fprintf call, the function signature, and block delimiters) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3; they do not need investigation under this rule. There are no loops or other conditional constructs in this function that could also be subject to Rule 14.3."
