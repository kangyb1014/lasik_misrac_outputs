  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__connections:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__connections (void)\n{\n  if (0 == tool_params.connections)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (get_num_threads () > tool_params.connections)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"The connections number limit (%u) is less than number \"\n             \"of threads used (%u).

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "When tool_params.connections == 0 the if-condition is true and the function returns 1 (because !0 == 1). That return affects control flow and program behaviour; removing the entire if would change behavior. Although the use of '! 0' is stylistically odd (it could be written as 'return 1;'), it is not dead code."
