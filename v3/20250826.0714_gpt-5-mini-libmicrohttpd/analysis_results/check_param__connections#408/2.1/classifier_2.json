  "scenario": "The fragment 'if (0 == tool_params.connections) return !0;' is an ordinary conditional return and is reachable whenever tool_params.connections can be zero at runtime. It only becomes unreachable if tool_params.connections is provably non\u2011zero (for example a compile\u2011time constant or guaranteed by prior logic/invariants), but no such guarantee is shown here. Based on the provided code alone, this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
