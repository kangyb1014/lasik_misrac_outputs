  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer declarations are present in this function that could be made to point to const-qualified types. Specific checks performed:\n- Function signature: static int check_param__connections(void) \u2014 no pointer parameters.\n- tool_params.connections is used as a scalar member (not a pointer).\n- get_num_threads() is used as a value-returning call (no pointer returned/assigned here).\n- The only other uses that involve pointer types are standard-library usage: the format string is a string literal passed to fprintf (fprintf\u2019s prototype takes a const char * for the format), and stderr is the standard FILE* stream provided by the library. Neither of these are user-declared pointer objects in this code that could be const-qualified here (stderr/FILE* is dictated by the standard library API and the format string is a literal). \nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
