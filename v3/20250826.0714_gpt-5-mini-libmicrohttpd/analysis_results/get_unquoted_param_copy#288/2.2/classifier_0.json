  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_unquoted_param_copy:\n```c\nstatic enum _MHD_GetUnqResult\nget_unquoted_param_copy (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                         char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                         char **ptmp2,\n                         size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                         struct _MHD_mstr_w_len *unquoted)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n\n  /* The value is present and is quoted, needs to be copied and unquoted */\n  /* Allocate buffer with one more additional byte for zero-termination */\n  unquoted->str =\n    get_buffer_for_size (tmp1, ptmp2, ptmp2_size, param->value.len + 1);\n\n  if (NULL == unquoted->str)\n    return (param->value.len + 1 > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE) ?\n           _MHD_UNQ_TOO_LARGE : _MHD_UNQ_OUT_OF_MEM;\n\n  if (! param->quoted)\n  {\n    memcpy (unquoted->str, param->value.str, param->value.len);\n    unquoted->len = param->value.len;\n    return _MHD_UNQ_OK;\n  }\n\n  unquoted->len =\n    MHD_str_unquote (param->value.str, param->value.len, unquoted->str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != unquoted->len);\n  mhd_assert (unquoted->len < param->value.len);\n  return _MHD_UNQ_OK;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! param->quoted)\n  {\n    memcpy (unquoted->str, param->value.str, param->value.len);\n    unquoted->len = param->value.len;\n    return _MHD_UNQ_OK;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. This branch handles the case when param->quoted is false: it copies the unquoted value, sets unquoted->len and returns. Removing it would change program behaviour (unquoted parameters would be handled incorrectly), so it is not dead code. (If in the whole project param->quoted were provably always true then the branch would be unreachable; note 2 of the rule treats unreachable code as not dead code.)"
