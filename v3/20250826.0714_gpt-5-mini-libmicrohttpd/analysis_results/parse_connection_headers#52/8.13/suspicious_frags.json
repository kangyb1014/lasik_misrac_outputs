  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no local pointer variables or pointer expressions in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specific reasoning:\n\n- The two local character-pointer variables are declared as const: \"const char *clen;\" and \"const char *enc;\", so they already point to const-qualified types.\n- The function parameter \"struct MHD_Connection *connection\" is a non-const pointer intentionally, because the function writes to fields of the connection (e.g., connection->rq.remaining_upload_size, connection->keepalive). Making that pointer const would not be correct.\n- All string literals used (for example, \"chunked\" and the header name macros) are inherently const and are passed where a const char * is expected; there are no assignments of string literals to non-const char * variables in this function.\n- Calls that take pointer outputs (e.g., passing &enc, &clen, &val_len) use variables with appropriate const qualifiers (enc/clen are const char *; val_len is a size_t length output) \u2014 these are consistent with the expectation of returning pointers to read-only header data.\n- No other pointer variables are declared or manipulated in a way that could be trivially strengthened to point to const data within this function.\n\nGiven the code visible here, there are no fragments that require investigation under Rule 8.13. If there are concerns about API signatures (functions such as MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, MHD_str_equal_caseless_, MHD_str_to_uint64_n_, or any macros expanding to non-const char *), those would require inspecting their declarations/definitions to ensure their pointer parameter types are const-qualified where appropriate; however, within this function itself there are no apparent violations to report."
