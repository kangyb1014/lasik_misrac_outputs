Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" analysis of OS_SymbolLookup_Static:\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t\n  - Need the struct layout (types of Name, Module, Address). This shows whether accessing StaticSym->Name/Module/Address has any side effects, and whether ++StaticSym performs pointer arithmetic over an array of these records (so the ++ does not modify unrelated objects). Also Address field type tells whether casting/reading it could affect caller loop counters (e.g. if Address is a reference into caller state).\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n  - This symbol provides the actual table or pointer initializer for StaticSym. Its definition reveals whether StaticSym is an array, pointer to shared state, or the result of a function/macro that could have side effects. That affects whether ++StaticSym or reads from the table can modify or depend on objects that might be loop counters in a for loop elsewhere.\n\n- strcmp\n  - The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside loop bodies as part of the loop body. Although strcmp is expected to be non-modifying, its declaration/implementation ensures it has no persistent side effects or hidden modifications of objects that could be loop counters. Confirming strcmp is pure (no side effects) is required to conclude the condition expressions do not violate clause 2/3 of the rule.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup (caller)\n  - This function calls OS_SymbolLookup_Static; to determine if OS_SymbolLookup_Static can violate the for-loop rule when used inside a for loop, inspect the caller to see whether it calls the static lookup inside a for loop and what argument it passes for SymbolAddress. If the caller passes the address of a loop counter (or a variable modified in the loop body), that would make OS_SymbolLookup_Static a body that modifies the loop counter (via *SymbolAddress assignment).\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup (caller)\n  - Same reason as OS_SymbolLookup: the caller must be checked to see whether it invokes OS_SymbolLookup_Static inside a for loop and whether it supplies an object that is a loop counter (or otherwise disallowed object) as SymbolAddress or via other parameters.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef)\n  - Knowing the underlying type of cpuaddr clarifies what is being written by *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address. If callers use a cpuaddr-typed variable as a loop counter, that assignment could constitute modification of the loop counter (violating clause 3/4). The typedef is needed to identify potential type-compatible loop counters.\n\n- int32 (typedef)\n  - Definition of int32 helps identify whether return_code or other ints could alias or be used as loop counters in callers (rare but necessary to rule out unexpected aliasing/type issues).\n\nNotes/analysis guidance for the next agent:\n- The target function itself contains no for-statement; the main MISRA concern is whether this function, when invoked inside a caller's for loop, modifies the caller's loop counter (directly or indirectly). To decide that, inspect the two callers (listed above) to see how they call OS_SymbolLookup_Static and what variables they pass (especially for SymbolAddress).\n- Also confirm that ++StaticSym only advances a local pointer into a static table (no shared/global modification), and that strcmp has no side effects. If callers never pass the address of a loop counter (or this function never modifies any object that can be a loop counter), then OS_SymbolLookup_Static does not introduce a MISRA for-loop violation."
