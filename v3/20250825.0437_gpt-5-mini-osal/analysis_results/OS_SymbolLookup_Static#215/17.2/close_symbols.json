  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_SymbolLookup_Static participates in direct or indirect recursion (MISRA rule: functions shall not call themselves, directly or indirectly), the analysis must inspect its callers and any functions they call that could form a call cycle back to OS_SymbolLookup_Static. The required symbols are:\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup: Direct caller of OS_SymbolLookup_Static; must be examined to see if it (or any functions it calls) leads back to OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup: Another direct caller; must be examined for potential cycles.\n- OS_printf: Callee of both callers; included to verify it does not (directly or indirectly) call back into OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl: Callee of OS_SymbolLookup; included because it could contain calls that create an indirect recursion back to OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType: Callee of the callers (test/harness stub); included because stubs/handlers can introduce callback paths that might call OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData: Same reason as above (possible callback path via test stubs/registration).\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: Same reason \u2014 executed handlers could call back into OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: Same reason \u2014 test harness stub that could contain callbacks.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup; included to check for any path back to the target.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup; included to check for any path back to the target.\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup; must be inspected for indirect calls returning to OS_SymbolLookup_Static.\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup; included to ensure it does not introduce a callback path to the target.\n\n(Only symbols necessary to explore potential call cycles involving OS_SymbolLookup_Static are listed. Symbols related purely to data or unrelated modules were omitted.)"
