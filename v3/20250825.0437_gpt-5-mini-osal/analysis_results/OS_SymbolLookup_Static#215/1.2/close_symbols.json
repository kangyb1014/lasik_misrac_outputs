  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_SymbolLookup_Static uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check) you must examine the definitions/expansions of the symbols it relies on:\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: Could be a macro or an object defined with compiler-specific attributes or pragmas (e.g. __attribute__((section(...))), __weak__, asm labels, or other extensions). Inspecting its definition is required to detect such extensions.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct/type definition may include non-standard extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-fields with non\u2011standard widths, GCC/MSC extensions, or atypical qualifiers). You must see the full type to verify standard-conforming constructs.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t::Name, OS_static_symbol_record_t::Module, OS_static_symbol_record_t::Address: Field types and any field-specific attributes (e.g. function-pointer types, attributes, or non-standard casts) can introduce language extensions; Address's type is particularly important because the code casts it to cpuaddr.\n\n- int32: This typedef may be implemented via compiler-specific keywords or attributes (e.g. using long long with attributes, or compiler typedefs). Confirm it is a standard typedef, not a macro or extension.\n\n- cpuaddr: This integer/pointer-sized typedef is used in an explicit cast (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address. Its definition could rely on implementation-specific types or attributes; verify it is a plain typedef and not a compiler extension.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: These macros/constants may be defined via enum or macros that themselves use compiler extensions (e.g. complex macro expressions, pragma-based generation). Check their definitions to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- strcmp: Although part of the standard C library, the project could remap/override it via a macro or inline wrapper that uses extensions. Verify the declaration/definition being linked to is the standard one.\n\nInspecting these symbols (the object/macro definitions, typedefs, and the struct and its field declarations) is sufficient to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are present in the target function's usage. Only these are necessary because the function body itself contains only standard C constructs (pointer arithmetic, comparisons, casts, and calls to strcmp), so any extension would originate from the referenced types/macros/objects."
