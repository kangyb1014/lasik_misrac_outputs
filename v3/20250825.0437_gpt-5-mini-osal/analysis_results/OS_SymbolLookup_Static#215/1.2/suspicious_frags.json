  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, __int128, pragma with vendor extension, or other vendor-specific annotations).\n- The typedefs (int32 as int32_t and cpuaddr as uintptr_t) use standard stdint types, which are part of standard C and not compiler extensions.\n- The macro usage (OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) and pointer iteration (++StaticSym), pointer comparisons with NULL, and calls to standard library functions (strcmp) are all standard C constructs.\n- The cast of a function pointer to cpuaddr (integer type) is implementation-defined/portable-concern behavior but is not, by itself, an explicit compiler extension documented as an extension; therefore it does not meet the criterion for reporting under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as specified in your instruction.\n\nIf you want to flag implementation-defined conversions (such as function-pointer-to-integer casts) for further safety review, indicate that and I will list those fragments separately."
