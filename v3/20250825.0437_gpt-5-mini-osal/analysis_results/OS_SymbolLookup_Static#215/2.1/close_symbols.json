  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to assess unreachable code in OS_SymbolLookup_Static:\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n  - This global/extern object is the initial value of StaticSym. To decide which while-loop iterations and branches can be reached you must know how this symbol is defined/initialized (NULL vs pointer to an array), its storage duration, and whether it can legally point to a sentinel-terminated array. If it is NULL the while body is never entered; if it points to an array without a terminating Name==NULL sentinel then the loop may not terminate (affecting reachability analysis of subsequent statements).\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t\n  - The struct layout (size, alignment) is required to reason about pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym) and whether incrementing through the array will stay within bounds until a sentinel is found. Also needed to confirm that accessing members (Name, Module, Address) is valid and not undefined behavior that could make code effectively unreachable.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t::Name\n  - The code uses StaticSym->Name as the sentinel (Name == NULL) and as an argument to strcmp. You need the semantics/type of Name (pointer type, const char * or other) and any invariants (e.g., guaranteed null-terminated sentinel) to determine whether the Name==NULL branch can be reached and therefore whether the later code paths are reachable.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t::Module\n  - Module is compared against ModuleName with strcmp when ModuleName is non-NULL. Knowing its type and validity is necessary to determine if the Module comparison branch can be reached without undefined behavior.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t::Address\n  - The code writes StaticSym->Address into *SymbolAddress (cast to cpuaddr). Knowing Address type/validity is needed to confirm that the assignment is a reachable and well-defined action when a match is found.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED\n  - Initial return_code value. To classify whether the initial value leads to an unreachable return (or whether some return paths are redundant) you should know this symbol (value/name) so you can tell whether the initial assignment plus possible early returns create unreachable statements.\n\n- OS_ERROR\n  - Assigned when a sentinel Name==NULL is encountered. Knowing this symbol clarifies which branch is taken at the end-of-list sentinel and whether that assignment and the subsequent break are reachable.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - Assigned when a matching symbol is found. Required to determine whether the success branch (assignment to *SymbolAddress and return_code=OS_SUCCESS) can be reached under normal/static conditions.\n\n- strcmp (prototype/semantics)\n  - Used to test string equality. You need its prototype/behavior to reason about whether strcmp can yield 0 (match) given the types of Name, SymbolName, Module and ModuleName, and to ensure use of strcmp does not itself invoke undefined behavior (e.g., if passed NULL pointers).\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef)\n  - The cast (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address and the SymbolAddress parameter type affect whether the assignment is well-formed; this matters when assessing whether that code path is reachable/safe.\n\n- NULL (macro)\n  - The code compares pointers to NULL (StaticSym != NULL and Name == NULL). Knowing the platform definition of NULL (and any project-specific redefinitions) is necessary to reason precisely about these pointer comparisons.\n\nNote: Callers of OS_SymbolLookup_Static are not required to determine whether internal statements are unreachable; the above symbols define the data layout, sentinels, and APIs that decide which branches/loop iterations inside this function can be reached."
