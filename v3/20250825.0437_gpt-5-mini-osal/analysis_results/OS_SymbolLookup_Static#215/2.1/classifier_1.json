  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment. The assignment OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE; is reachable when the function is called and does not itself create unreachable code. (The subsequent while (StaticSym != NULL) loop may or may not iterate at runtime depending on the macro\u2019s value, but that is not statically unreachable in the provided code.)\n\nSpecific violation scenario (hypothetical): If OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE were defined as a compile-time null pointer constant such that StaticSym is provably always NULL (for example #define OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE ((OS_static_symbol_record_t *)0) and this is visible to the compiler), then the body of while (StaticSym != NULL) would be statically unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
