  "explanation": "I inspected OS_MutSemTake_Impl and all related definitions provided. I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (for example: GCC/clang __attribute__ or __extension__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* intrinsics, compiler-specific pragmas, or nonstandard keywords). The code uses the POSIX pthread API (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_mutex_lock) which is a platform/library API, not a compiler language extension. The static inline helper, macros, typedefs (int32_t), struct definitions, and macro-based indexing are all standard C constructs. Therefore there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
