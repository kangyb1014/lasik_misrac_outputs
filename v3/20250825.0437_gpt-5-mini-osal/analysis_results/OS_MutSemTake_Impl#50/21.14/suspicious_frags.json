  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided target code (OS_MutSemTake_Impl) contains only: retrieval of a table entry via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, a call to pthread_mutex_lock, status checks, and a declaration of the OS_impl_mutex_table array. There is no use of memcmp (nor any string comparison) anywhere in the given fragments or related definitions. Therefore there are no code fragments to investigate for this rule."
