  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d we must determine whether the loop condition (i < Length) can change during loop execution. The listed symbols are required for these determinations:\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32: to know whether the parameter Length is of a plain integer type or carries qualifiers (e.g. volatile) via the typedef. If Length is volatile or has special attributes, reads of Length are not necessarily invariant.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint8: to know whether the pointed-to type has qualifiers (e.g. volatile) that affect whether stores through Byte_ptr[i] can have observable side effects that might modify other storage (aliasing considerations). Size information is trivial but qualifiers matter for semantics.\n\n- declaration/prototype/annotations of UtMemFill (parameter qualifiers: volatile, restrict, const, attributes): the function prototype or attributes can declare Memory as restrict/volatile/const or use compiler attributes that change aliasing or visibility of side effects. For example, a 'restrict' contract can rule out aliasing between Memory and other objects; absence of such qualifier leaves aliasing possible.\n\n- all call sites of UtMemFill (from the static call graph) with the actual argument expressions passed for Memory and Length: to establish whether Length is a compile-time constant/invariant at the call or whether the Memory argument could point to storage that aliases the storage that holds Length in the caller. The controlling expression is only invariant if Length cannot be modified (directly or indirectly) during loop execution.\n\n- definitions (declarations and types/qualifiers) of the objects whose addresses are passed as the Memory argument at each call site: if a caller passes the address of some object that may overlap or alias the storage used for its own Length parameter (for example, passing a pointer into its own stack frame), writes through Byte_ptr could modify Length, making the loop condition non\u2011invariant. You need the object types/qualifiers to reason about aliasing and volatile semantics.\n\n- definitions/declarations of any variables/expression used to produce the Length argument at each call site (including whether they are constants, volatile, or otherwise qualified): if Length is a compile-time constant or an immutable value, the loop condition can be invariant; if Length is volatile or can be modified by aliasing or concurrently, it is not invariant. Knowing the origin/qualification of Length at each call site is essential.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (1) whether Length is effectively invariant for the duration of the loop, (2) whether writes through Byte_ptr can alter Length (aliasing), and (3) whether language or compiler attributes force or prevent such aliasing or make reads observable (volatile)."
