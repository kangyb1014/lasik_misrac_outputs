  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies a function parameter itself. Specifically:\n- There is no assignment to Memory or Length (no statements like Memory = ..., Length = ..., or Memory++/--).\n- The line \"uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\" copies the value of the parameter into a local pointer; it does not modify the parameter object Memory.\n- The write \"Byte_ptr[i] = i;\" modifies the object pointed to by the parameter (the memory contents), which is explicitly allowed by the rule; it does not modify the pointer parameter itself.\n- The loop index i is a local variable and is not a parameter.\nTherefore there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
