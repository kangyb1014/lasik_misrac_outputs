  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs: function definition, for loop, array indexing, pointer assignment and integer types. There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, nested functions, pragmas, or other vendor-specific constructs). The identifiers uint32 and uint8 appear to be typedefs (not language extensions) \u2014 their definitions are not shown here, and nothing in this snippet proves they are compiler extensions. The implicit conversion from void* to an object pointer (uint8 *) and the array indexing Byte_ptr[i] are standard C behavior. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that clearly use language/compiler extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. If the project-wide definitions of uint32/uint8 are later found to map to nonstandard compiler-specific types, those definitions (not this snippet) should be investigated."
