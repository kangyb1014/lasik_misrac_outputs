  "explanation": "I examined the provided UtMemFill implementation and related typedef. There are no calls to memcmp or any other C standard library string-comparison functions, no use of char* pointing to null-terminated strings, and no string literals. The function writes raw bytes into a buffer via a uint8* and iterates by Length; this is a memory-fill operation, not a string comparison. Therefore there are no fragments in the given code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the project, those locations should be inspected, but nothing in the submitted code needs investigation for Rule 21.14."
