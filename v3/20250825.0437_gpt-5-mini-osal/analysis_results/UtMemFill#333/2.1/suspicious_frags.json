  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs are present in the provided function. Every statement is potentially reachable at runtime: the assignment uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; is executed on every invocation; the for loop header for (i = 0; i < Length; i++) is a runtime-controlled loop (its body is conditionally executed depending on the value of Length, which is not a compile-time constant) so the loop body is not statically unreachable. There are no constant false conditions, no code after an unconditional return, no labels/gotos that skip code, and no other constructs that would make any statement impossible to execute. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
