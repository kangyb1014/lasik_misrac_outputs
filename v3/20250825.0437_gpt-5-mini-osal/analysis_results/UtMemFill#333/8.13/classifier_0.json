  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer Byte_ptr is used to modify the memory (Byte_ptr[i] = i;), so it must not be const-qualified. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified only when the pointed-to object does not need modification; here modification is intended, so the rule is not violated. (If the memory were only read, the parameter should be declared as const void * and Byte_ptr as const uint8 *.)"
