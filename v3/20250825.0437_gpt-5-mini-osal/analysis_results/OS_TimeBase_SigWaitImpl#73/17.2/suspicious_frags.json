  "explanation": "The fragments not listed are straightforward helpers or simple operations that do not perform waits or call into the implementation layer and therefore are unlikely to participate in an indirect recursion back to OS_TimeBase_SigWaitImpl. In particular:\n- OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are pure index/validation helpers (no blocking or external callbacks).\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usages are simple table lookups, not function calls that could re-enter higher-level logic.\n- Simple assignments, checks, and return paths in the provided functions do not invoke external wait/impl-layer functionality.\n- The only calls that can plausibly cause an indirect call chain that might re-enter the timebase signal-wait routine are OS_ObjectIdGetById (which chains into transaction/convert/wait logic) and the impl-wait call OS_WaitForStateChange invoked from OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, and the sigwait call itself. Those have been included above for investigation.\nTherefore other fragments from the provided code are not flagged because they do not present a plausible path for indirect recursion to OS_TimeBase_SigWaitImpl based on the supplied code."
