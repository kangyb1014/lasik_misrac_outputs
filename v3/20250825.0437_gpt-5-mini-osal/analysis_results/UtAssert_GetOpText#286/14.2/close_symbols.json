The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n- UtAssert_Compare_t: The switch selector type must be known to confirm it is an ordinary enum/integer type and not a macro or complex type that could have hidden side-effects or expand into code containing a for loop. Knowing the typedef/definition ensures the switch expression is side-effect free and that no loop constructs are introduced via type definition.\n- UtAssert_Compare_EQ, UtAssert_Compare_NEQ, UtAssert_Compare_LT, UtAssert_Compare_GT, UtAssert_Compare_LTEQ, UtAssert_Compare_GTEQ, UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_SET, UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_UNSET: Each enumerator/constant used in the switch must be examined to ensure it is a simple constant (enum or #define) and not a macro or expression that could expand to code with side effects or a for loop. MISRA analysis requires verifying that none of these symbols introduce loop behaviour or modify objects used as loop counters.\n\nNote: The target function contains no calls (callees list empty) and no for loops in its body. The only potential risk for violating the MISRA for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness rule would be if any of the above symbols (type or enumerators) were implemented as macros or constructs that expand to for loops or modify loop counters. No other symbols (callers/callees) are required to determine whether this function itself contains or hides a for loop."
