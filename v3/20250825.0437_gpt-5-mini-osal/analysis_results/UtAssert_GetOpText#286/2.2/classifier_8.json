  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtAssert_GetOpText:\n```c\nconst char *UtAssert_GetOpText(UtAssert_Compare_t CompareType)\n{\n    const char *OpText;\n\n    switch (CompareType)\n    {\n        case UtAssert_Compare_EQ: /* actual equals reference value */\n            OpText = \"==\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_NEQ: /* actual does not non equal reference value */\n            OpText = \"!=\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_LT: /* actual less than reference (exclusive) */\n            OpText = \"<\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_GT: /* actual greater than reference (exclusive)  */\n            OpText = \">\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_LTEQ: /* actual less than or equal to reference (inclusive) */\n            OpText = \"<=\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_GTEQ: /* actual greater than reference (inclusive) */\n            OpText = \">=\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_SET: /* bit(s) in reference are set in actual */\n            OpText = \"&\";\n            break;\n        case UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_UNSET: /* bit(s) in reference are not set in actual */\n            OpText = \"&~\";\n            break;\n        default: /* should never happen */\n            OpText = \"??\";\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return OpText;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncase UtAssert_Compare_LTEQ: /* actual less than or equal to reference (inclusive) */\n            OpText = \"<=\";\n            break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: this case assigns OpText = \"<=\" which determines the function return when CompareType == UtAssert_Compare_LTEQ. Removal would change behaviour for that input, so it is not dead code. A concrete violation scenario would be if the assignment were executed but always overwritten before use (e.g. OpText is assigned again for every control path before returning) or if the same enum value were handled elsewhere such that this assignment is redundant; only in such cases would the operation be dead."
