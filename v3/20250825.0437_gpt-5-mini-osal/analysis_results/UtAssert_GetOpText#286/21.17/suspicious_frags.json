  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. The code only assigns pointers to string literals (e.g. \"==\", \"!=\", \"&~\", \"??\"), which are compile-time constant objects with an implicit null terminator; these assignments do not perform any string manipulation or buffer accesses that could run beyond object bounds. There is no pointer arithmetic, no destination buffers, and no calls to the standard string handling APIs, so Rule 21.17 is not triggered by any fragment in this function."
