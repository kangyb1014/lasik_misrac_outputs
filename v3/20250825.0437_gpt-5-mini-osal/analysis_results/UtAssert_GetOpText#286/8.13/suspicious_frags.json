  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this function is the local variable declared as `const char *OpText` and the function return type is `const char *`. All assigned values are string literals (which have type compatible with pointer-to-const-char), so there are no pointers to non-const-qualified types that would violate the rule. There are no other pointer variables or implicit pointer conversions in the code fragment that require investigation."
