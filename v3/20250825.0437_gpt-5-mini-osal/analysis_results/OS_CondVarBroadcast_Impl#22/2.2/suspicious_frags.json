  "explanation": "No executed operation in the provided function is redundant or removable without changing program behaviour. Rationale: \n- The index extraction (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)) via the macro) reads token->obj_idx and is required to locate the correct table entry; removing it would change which condvar is referenced. \n- The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is used to obtain impl->cv; removing that would prevent calling pthread_cond_broadcast on the intended condvar. \n- The call to pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cv) has observable side effects (it wakes waiting threads) and its removal would alter program behaviour. \n- The status variable stores the return value of pthread_cond_broadcast and is used to determine the function return (OS_ERROR vs OS_SUCCESS); the test and the two return statements are therefore behaviourally significant. \n- The macro definition and the OS_impl_condvar_table are necessary to compute the address passed to pthread_cond_broadcast; these are not dead. \n- There is no unreachable code in the fragment, and initialization semantics (note in the rule) are not applicable here. \nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that meet the MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition of dead code."
