  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only pointer parameters/variables are:\n- const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 already points to a const-qualified type, satisfying Rule 8.13.\n- OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl \u2014 this pointer must remain non-const because the function calls pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cv), which operates on and may modify the condition variable internal state; therefore impl cannot be const-qualified here.\n- The address-of expression &impl->cv yields a pthread_cond_t * as required by pthread_cond_broadcast and cannot be const.\nBecause every pointer in this function is either already const-qualified where possible (token) or intentionally non-const due to required modification semantics (impl and its cv), there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
