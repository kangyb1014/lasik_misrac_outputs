  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The only string comparison is performed with strcmp(MetaPtr->Name, Name) after verifying MetaPtr->Name != NULL, which uses the appropriate null-terminated string function rather than memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp for null-terminated string comparison)."
