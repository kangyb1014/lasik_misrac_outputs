  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Hook_GetArgPtr:\n```c\nconst void *UT_Hook_GetArgPtr(const UT_StubContext_t *ContextPtr, const char *Name, size_t ExpectedTypeSize)\n{\n    uint32                      i;\n    const void *                Result;\n    const UT_StubArgMetaData_t *MetaPtr;\n\n    static const union\n    {\n        unsigned long AsInt;\n        void *        AsPtr;\n        double        AsFloat;\n    } ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE = {0};\n\n    Result = NULL;\n    for (i = 0; i < ContextPtr->ArgCount; ++i)\n    {\n        MetaPtr = &ContextPtr->Meta[i];\n        if (MetaPtr->Name != NULL)\n        {\n            if (strcmp(MetaPtr->Name, Name) == 0 && (MetaPtr->Size == 0 || MetaPtr->Size == ExpectedTypeSize))\n            {\n                if (MetaPtr->Type == UT_STUBCONTEXT_ARG_TYPE_DIRECT)\n                {\n                    Result = &ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i];\n                }\n                else if (MetaPtr->Type == UT_STUBCONTEXT_ARG_TYPE_INDIRECT)\n                {\n                    Result = ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i];\n                }\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If no suitable result pointer was found, this means a mismatch\n     * between the stub and test case, such as a change in argument/parameter names.\n     * This is an error that should be corrected, so report it as a failure.\n     */\n    if (Result == NULL)\n    {\n        UtAssert_Failed(\"Requested parameter %s of size %lu which was not provided by the stub\", Name,\n                        (unsigned long)ExpectedTypeSize);\n\n        if (ExpectedTypeSize <= sizeof(ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE))\n        {\n            Result = &ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * As the caller will likely dereference the returned pointer, should\n             * never return NULL.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop is for (i = 0; i < ContextPtr->ArgCount; ++i) and meets the clauses of Rule 14.2: the first clause initializes the single loop counter i, the second clause uses only i and ContextPtr->ArgCount (which is not modified in the loop body), and the third clause modifies only i. The shown fragment only reads ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i] and assigns to Result and does not modify the loop counter or ContextPtr->ArgCount. (A violating scenario would be if the loop body or called functions modified the loop counter or ContextPtr->ArgCount, or if the second/third clause referenced objects that the body modifies.)"
