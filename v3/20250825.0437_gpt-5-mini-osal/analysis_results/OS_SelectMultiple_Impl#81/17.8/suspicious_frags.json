  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this implementation. The parameters are: ReadSet (OS_FdSet *), WriteSet (OS_FdSet *), and msecs (int32). The code does not assign to ReadSet, WriteSet, or msecs anywhere (no '=' to those identifiers, no increments/decrements, no pointer reassignments). Calls such as OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl(..., ReadSet) and OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl(..., ReadSet) may modify the object pointed to by ReadSet or WriteSet, which is permitted by Rule 17.8; passing addresses of local variables (e.g., &rd_set, &wr_set, &maxfd) only modifies local objects. Therefore there are no fragments that violate \"a function parameter should not be modified.\""
