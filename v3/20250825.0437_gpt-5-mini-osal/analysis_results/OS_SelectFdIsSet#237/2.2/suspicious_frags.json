Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have limited the selections to actual executable statements in the function that could plausibly be dead or redundant in some build/configuration scenarios. The following parts of the code do not require investigation for Rule 2.2 based on the provided snippet: the function signature and return type (they are required), the declaration and use of local_id in the index/shift expressions (local_id is used in computing the array index and bit position, so those lines are not dead), and the shift/index expressions (they directly implement the intended bit test). Comments and whitespace are not executable and therefore not relevant. The selected fragments are the statements most likely to be redundant or compiled out (e.g. assert-style macros, an error-path that may never be taken, or a masking operation that may be unnecessary given the boolean return type) and should be investigated further. No other executable statements in this snippet appear to be dead code."
