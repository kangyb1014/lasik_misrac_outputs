  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that could plausibly introduce unreachable code paths and therefore merit investigation: pointer-check macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER / BUGCHECK_VOID) which may abort or otherwise alter control flow; the call to OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex and the subsequent if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) branch in OS_SelectFdClear (the branch may or may not be reachable depending on the object-id/type/max_id logic); the parameter checks and conditional returns inside OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex (type mismatch and max_id == 0 paths); the OS_printf entry checks (GlobalState/PrintfEnabled) and the BUGCHECK_VOID on its String parameter; and the OS_FdSet array sizing expression which could affect indexing behavior. These are the places where unreachable code may be created either by macros that do not return, by compile-time/constant-driven conditions, or by invariants that make branches impossible. Other fragments in the provided code (simple declarations, typedefs, the final return return_code;, the bitwise mask expression itself beyond the included branch, and constant macro definitions like OS_SUCCESS/OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM) are not included because they are either purely declarative, do not introduce alternative control-flow paths, or are already encompassed by the suspicious fragments above and therefore do not require separate investigation for Rule 2.1."
