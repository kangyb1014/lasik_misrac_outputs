  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related symbol definitions and found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions. The code only uses standard ISO C constructs: a static function, standard integer types (uint8_t), preprocessor macros (#define), normal casts ((int)InputPri), arithmetic, if/else control flow, and an extern declaration. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords or pragmas. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If there are additional related type or global definitions (e.g. definition of POSIX_GlobalVars_t) not shown here, please provide them \u2014 only then could any hidden compiler-specific extensions in those definitions be evaluated."
