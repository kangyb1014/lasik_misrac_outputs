  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related declarations. There are no pointer types, pointer parameters, pointer return types, pointer dereferences (&/*), or address-of operations in the shown code. The function OS_PriorityRemap uses only scalar types (osal_priority_t -> uint8_t, int) and accesses a non-pointer global object POSIX_GlobalVars (declared as an extern object, not a pointer). Therefore there are no pointer instances in the provided fragments that could be qualified const per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If POSIX_GlobalVars_t (the type definition) contained pointer members, those members are not shown here and thus cannot be evaluated from the given code; based on the code shown, no pointer-related fragments require investigation."
