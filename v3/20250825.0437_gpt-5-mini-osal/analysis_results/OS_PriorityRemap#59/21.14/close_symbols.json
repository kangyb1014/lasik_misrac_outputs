  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (\"memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\"): \n\n- osal_priority_t (typedef)\n  - Needed to confirm the type of InputPri. The MISRA rule targets use of memcmp on null-terminated strings; if InputPri were a pointer or string type the function might be doing or forwarding string comparisons. Verifying it is an integer (or other non-string) type eliminates that concern.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY (macro/constant)\n  - Required to inspect compile-time value and type (integer constant) used in arithmetic. Ensures no macros expand to or alias string comparison calls (and to confirm all operations are numeric, not string-based).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (global variable)\n  - The function reads fields from this global. The symbol definition is required to confirm the types of the accessed fields and to ensure those fields are not computed via macros or accessors that could perform or wrap string comparisons.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits (type/structure)\n  - Need the structure/type definition to check the types of PriorityMax/PriorityMin (e.g., integer vs pointer) and to ensure there are no side-effecting accessors or macros that internally call memcmp.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax (field)\n  - Required to verify this field is numeric and that referencing it does not hide any memcmp usage via macros or inline functions.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin (field)\n  - Same reason as PriorityMax: confirm numeric type and absence of hidden string-compare usage when referenced.\n\n- memcmp (standard library function declaration)\n  - Include the symbol so the analyzer can check for any direct or indirect uses of memcmp in the function or in any symbols it references (macros, inline functions, accessor wrappers). The MISRA rule is specifically about memcmp on null-terminated strings, so confirming absence of memcmp calls (or that any memcmp calls do not take null-terminated strings) is necessary.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst confirm that all identifiers used by OS_PriorityRemap are numeric/integer and that there are no direct or hidden calls to memcmp (or macros expanding to memcmp) within the function or via the accessed globals."
