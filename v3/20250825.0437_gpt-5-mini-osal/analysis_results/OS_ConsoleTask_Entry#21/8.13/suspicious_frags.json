  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are not pointer targets that could reasonably be const-qualified, or they necessarily require a mutable target:  \n- The sem_wait(&local->data_sem) call takes a semaphore object that is modified by the API (the semaphore state must be mutable), so the &local->data_sem argument cannot be const.  \n- The while loop condition and GlobalState access (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState) are reads of scalar/non-pointer data and not relevant to pointer const-qualification.  \n- The return NULL; and control-flow constructs (if/while) do not involve pointer types that could be made const.  \n- Union members that are integer/id types (e.g., local_arg.id) and non-pointer local variables (e.g., token) are not candidates for const qualification.  \n- Any API-required signatures (e.g., thread entry point returning void * / accepting void *) are kept as-is because they must match the required prototype; they are noted in the suspicious list only where the value flow suggests a possible const qualification could be applied inside the implementation.  \nThese unflagged fragments therefore either must remain non-const due to API/semantic requirements or are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
