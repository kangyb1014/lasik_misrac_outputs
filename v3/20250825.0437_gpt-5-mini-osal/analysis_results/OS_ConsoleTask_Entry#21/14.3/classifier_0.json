  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the loop condition depends on the global variable OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState which is intended to be updated externally (so the controlling expression is not invariant). A violation would occur if the controlling expression were provably constant \u2014 for example if GlobalState were defined as a compile-time constant or const-qualified (or otherwise cannot change during the loop, or the compiler can prove it never changes because there are no visible writes and no synchronization/volatile), in which case the loop condition would be invariant and Rule 14.3 would be violated."
