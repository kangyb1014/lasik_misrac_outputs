  "explanation": "You need the prototypes/types for each called function and the relevant typedefs so you can determine whether any of the function parameters in UtMem2BinFile are being (or could be) modified (directly or indirectly via pointer-to-pointer parameters). Brief reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- fopen: provides the signature (const char *filename, const char *mode) and shows that Filename is passed by value as const char * (so the pointer itself is not expected to be modified by fopen). Knowing its prototype rules out fopen as a modifier of the Filename parameter.\n\n- fwrite: provides the signature (const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream). This confirms the Memory pointer is passed by value as const void * (object may be read/written but the pointer itself is not modified in the caller). You must verify the const in its prototype to confirm compliance.\n\n- fclose: signature (FILE *stream) \u2014 ensures only the local FILE* is passed; fclose cannot modify the function parameters Memory, Filename or Length.\n\n- printf: signature (const char *format, ...) \u2014 used with Filename as an argument; confirms printf receives a copy of the pointer/value and cannot modify the caller's pointer variable.\n\n- strerror: signature (int errnum) -> char * \u2014 although it returns a pointer, it is called with errno; includes it to verify it does not accept or modify Filename/Memory pointers.\n\n- errno: global/error indicator \u2014 included because strerror(errno) is used; you need to know that errno is not one of the function's parameters and cannot cause modification of the target function's parameters.\n\n- UtAssert_True: prototype for this test-helper/ASSERT function (likely takes a Boolean and a const char *message). Include to confirm it does not accept any of the target function's parameters by reference/pointer-to-pointer that could be modified.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: static call graph shows this is involved in assertions. Include its prototype to ensure none of the target's parameters are passed to it in a way that would allow modification (e.g., pointer-to-pointer).\n\n- FILE: the FILE type (from stdio.h) \u2014 included to understand what is being passed/returned and to ensure no aliasing or pointer-to-pointer semantics are hidden.\n\n- size_t: required to interpret fwrite signature relative to uint32 Length (to ensure only value conversions occur, not pointer modification).\n\n- uint32: the typedef used for Length in this code \u2014 include to confirm it is an integer-by-value type and cannot be modified via called functions unless passed by pointer.\n\n- bool: the Boolean type used in return and in UtAssert_True calls; included to ensure the types of parameters/arguments are as expected.\n\nIn short: every function/type that receives any of the parameters (Memory, Filename, Length) or participates in the error path (UtAssert_True/UtAssert_GetContext) must be known so you can check their prototypes for pointer-to-pointer or non-const pointer parameters. If all of the listed functions accept the parameters by value (or by const pointer where appropriate) and none accept a pointer-to-pointer to those parameters, then UtMem2BinFile does not violate the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
