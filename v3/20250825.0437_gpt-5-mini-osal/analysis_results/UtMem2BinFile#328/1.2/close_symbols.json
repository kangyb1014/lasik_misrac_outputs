  "explanation": "For checking whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions of all non-obvious types and identifiers used by the function: \n\n- bool: Determine whether this is the standard C99/_Bool (stdbool.h) or a project/compiler extension (macro/typedef). If bool is a nonstandard typedef or a compiler-provided extension, that would be relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- uint32: This is not a standard C type name (standard is uint32_t). You must see its typedef/definition to know whether it is a project alias or a compiler extension (e.g., built-in typedefs or compiler-provided names).\n\n- FILE: Verify this is the standard library FILE type (from <stdio.h>) and not redefined or replaced by a project/extension.\n\n- fopen / fwrite / fclose / printf / strerror: Confirm these are the standard C library functions (their standard prototypes) and not replaced by macros or compiler-specific variants that use extensions (e.g., variadic/attribute annotations, built-ins, or nonportable signatures). strerror in particular can be provided by POSIX or other libs; confirm it is standard and not an extension.\n\n- errno: errno can be a macro that expands to a thread-local function/extension (e.g., __errno_location()). Inspect its definition in the build environment to ensure it is not a compiler/library extension that would violate the rule.\n\n- size_t: Used by fwrite prototype; verify it is the standard definition (from <stddef.h>/<stdio.h>) and not shadowed by a nonstandard type.\n\n- UtAssert_True: Project-specific assertion used in the else path. Inspect whether it is a simple function or a macro that employs compiler extensions (variadic macros, statement expressions, __attribute__, inline assembly, etc.). Project macros are a common source of compiler-specific extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions (typedefs, macros, and function prototypes/implementations) allows a determinative check whether any language/compiler extension is used directly in the target function (via types/macros/functions it relies on) or indirectly through substituted definitions."
