  "explanation": "I selected all function-call sites present in UtMem2BinFile plus the UtAssert_True macro definition because indirect recursion could occur via any called function (e.g. UtAssertEx invoked by the macro). Other fragments in the provided code do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: there are no direct calls to UtMem2BinFile within the function body, no function-pointer invocations, and no other functions or constructs shown that call other routines. The UtAssert_GetContext() implementation merely returns DefaultContext and contains no calls, so it cannot cause indirect recursion and therefore does not need investigation. Variable declarations, return statements, and the control-structure syntax in the function do not create calls and so are not relevant to checking for self- or indirect recursion."
