  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above (for example: the function signature, the local variable declaration FILE *fp;, or other surrounding syntactic elements) are not reported because they are clearly reachable and their removal would change program behavior (they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2). Note that MISRA distinguishes unreachable code from dead code; unreachable code need not be treated as dead. Also initialization semantics differ from plain assignment (per the rule notes). The items reported above were chosen because they relate to control-flow and assertion machinery whose concrete behaviour (whether the assertion call returns or aborts, whether return paths are effective, and whether certain calls are effectively no-ops in some builds) can make subsequent operations redundant or otherwise qualify as dead code; those aspects require further investigation of the assertion implementation/configuration and related symbols. Other statements not listed are executed in normal flow and therefore unlikely to be dead code."
