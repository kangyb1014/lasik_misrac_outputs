  "explanation": "No calls to the string handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in OS_QueueDelete_Impl. The only string-related identifier present is strerror(errno) inside an OS_DEBUG call; strerror does not take a user-supplied pointer parameter that could lead to an out-of-bounds write (it returns a pointer to an internal static string), and furthermore OS_DEBUG is defined as empty so the call is not actually emitted/evaluated here. Other operations (mq_close, accessing the object table via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, use of errno) are not string handling operations relevant to Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under this MISRA rule."
