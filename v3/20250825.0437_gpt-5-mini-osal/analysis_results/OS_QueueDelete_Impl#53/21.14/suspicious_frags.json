  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any equivalent raw memory comparison used to compare null-terminated strings) in the provided code. The OS_QueueDelete_Impl function only calls mq_close and uses errno and strerror for diagnostics; there are no string comparisons (no memcmp, strncmp, strcmp, or custom memory-compare macros) in the function or in the related symbols you supplied (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_impl_queue_table, type definitions, or OS_DEBUG). OS_DEBUG is defined empty, so it does not introduce any hidden memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
