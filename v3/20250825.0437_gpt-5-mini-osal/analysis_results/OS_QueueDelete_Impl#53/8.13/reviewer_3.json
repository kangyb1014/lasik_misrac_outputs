  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_QueueDelete_Impl the local variable impl is only used for read access (impl->id) and the function does not modify the pointed-to record. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should therefore be declared to point to a const-qualified type, e.g. const OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (a pointer to a non-const table element) to a pointer-to-const is permitted, so changing the declaration to a const pointer is feasible here and removes the rule violation."
