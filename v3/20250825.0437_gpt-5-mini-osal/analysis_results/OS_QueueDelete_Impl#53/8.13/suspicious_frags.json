  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either already use const-qualified pointers or do not involve pointer types. Specifically: the function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const OS_object_token_t *; the use of &(tok) in the macro passes a const pointer to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken; and there are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning calls in the shown code that could be made to point to const-qualified types. The listed fragments are the locations where a non-const pointer is obtained or declared for an object that is not modified in this function and thus should be investigated for possible const-qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
