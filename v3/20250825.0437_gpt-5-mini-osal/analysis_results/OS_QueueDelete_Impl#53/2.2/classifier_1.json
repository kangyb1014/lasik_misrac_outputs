Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_QueueDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_QueueDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32                            return_code;\n    OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_queue_table, *token);\n\n    /* Try to delete and unlink the queue */\n    if (mq_close(impl->id) != 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_QueueDelete Error during mq_close(). errno = %d (%s)\\n\", errno, strerror(errno));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_QueueDelete_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_queue_internal_record_t OS_impl_queue_table[OS_MAX_QUEUES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    mqd_t id;\n} OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nimpl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_queue_table, *token);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is used later (impl->id is accessed for mq_close). Removing this assignment would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. The macro expands to a pointer computed from the token index and has no hidden side-effects; the operation therefore affects program behaviour and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
