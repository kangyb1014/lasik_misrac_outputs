  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The statement os_proto = 0; is executed on entry but has no observable effect: every path that reaches the call to socket() assigns os_proto in the preceding switch, and any path that would not assign it returns earlier. The assignment therefore can be removed without changing program behaviour, which meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note 3 about initializations not being candidates for dead code does not apply here because this is an assignment statement, not an initializer.)"
