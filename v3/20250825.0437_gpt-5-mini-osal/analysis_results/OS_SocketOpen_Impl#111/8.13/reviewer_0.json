  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types: a pointer declaration should use a const-qualified target type when the pointer does not need to modify the pointee. In the submitted code os_flags is an int object, not a pointer. Passing &os_flags to setsockopt yields an int * (which is converted to the parameter type); on POSIX the prototype is setsockopt(..., const void *optval, ...), so the function expects a pointer to const data and the conversion from int * to const void * is valid. Thus there is no MISRA 8.13 violation here. (You may choose to declare os_flags as const for clarity, but 8.13 does not require making the object const merely because its address is taken for a const-parameter call.)"
