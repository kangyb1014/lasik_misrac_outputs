  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The single assignment console->ReadPos = StartPos; does not call any function from <string.h> and by itself cannot cause accesses beyond object bounds. In the shown code StartPos is maintained to be within [0, console->BufSize) (it is wrapped to 0 when StartPos >= console->BufSize), so the stored value is valid. Note: Rule 21.17 would be relevant to the earlier call OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(&console->BufBase[StartPos], WriteSize) if that implementation used string.h functions unsafely, but the assignment statement itself does not violate Rule 21.17."
