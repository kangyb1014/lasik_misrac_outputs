  "explanation": "The only potential MISRA Rule 21.17 issues come from places where a buffer pointer and a length are computed and then used to access memory. Those are the fragments listed above: initial read/write indices taken from the console record, the computation of WriteSize (both wrap and non-wrap cases), the call that passes &console->BufBase[StartPos] with WriteSize, the update of StartPos and wrap handling, and the final write-back of ReadPos. Other lines in the function do not perform pointer/length arithmetic or call functions that access the buffer (for example, declarations, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_BSP_Lock_Impl, OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl) and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17. No direct calls to <string.h> functions appear in this snippet; the concern is only the potential out-of-bounds access when passing the buffer pointer and size to the console output implementation."
