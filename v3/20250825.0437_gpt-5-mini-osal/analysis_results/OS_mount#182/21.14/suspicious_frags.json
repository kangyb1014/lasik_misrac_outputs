  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected the provided OS_mount function and the additional definitions. There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the shown code. The only string operations in the provided fragments are:\n- OS_CHECK_STRING macro invocation (which expands to pointer and length checks) \u2014 the macro body shown does not include memcmp; the LENGTHCHECK/OS_CHECK_POINTER definitions were not provided, but based on their names they are for null/length checks rather than string comparison. Their implementations were not supplied and therefore cannot be included as suspicious fragments here.\n- A direct character test filesys->system_mountpt[0] == 0 (not memcmp).\n- strncpy used to copy mountpoint into filesys->virtual_mountpt (strncpy is allowed here; it is not memcmp).\n- No other string comparisons appear (flags are bitwise-tested, fstype compared to constants, stat/mkdir/strerror used).\n\nNote: There are a few related functions referenced but not defined in the provided code (for example OS_ObjectNameMatch, LENGTHCHECK, OS_CHECK_POINTER, and any helper used by OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch). If those omitted routines/macros use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, they would be potential violations and must be reviewed. However, because their implementations were not included in the supplied code, they cannot be reported as suspicious fragments from the given codebase here."
