  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed were judged not to require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const-qualified pointer types (the function parameters in the prototype are declared as const char *), perform writes that necessarily require a non-const target (e.g. assignments to filesys->flags and writes into filesys->virtual_mountpt), or involve objects passed by address that are expected to be mutated by the callee (the token variable passed as &token). Simple scalar variables and control-flow statements (if/else, return_code assignments, checks like filesys->system_mountpt[0] == 0) do not introduce pointer const-qualification concerns. The fragments above were selected because they contain pointer declarations or pointer-typed usage/calls (macro calls, table accessors, and library-like calls such as OS_ObjectIdGetByName/OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl and strncpy) where the const qualification of the pointed-to type should be verified in the API/macros/struct definitions to ensure compliance with Rule 8.13."
