  "explanation": "- OS_SharedGlobalVars: The global object name could be a macro or a structure with accessor functions or side effects; its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not expand to or call any <string.h> functions.\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: The member's type or accessor could be defined via macros or inline routines that might invoke or wrap string.h functions; examine its declaration/definition to rule out indirect string operations.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: These identifiers may be macros (or expressions) rather than plain enum/consts. Their definitions must be checked to ensure they do not expand to calls that use string.h functions.\n- INT_MAX: Macro from limits.h \u2014 include its definition to verify it is a simple integer macro and not redefined in the project to something that triggers string handling.\n- uint64, uint32, int32: The typedefs (or macros) for these integer types must be checked to ensure they are plain integer types and not macros that hide function calls.\n- ticks (parameter type: int *): The pointer target/type should be verified in the translation unit and any annotations/macros around it (e.g., pointer-checking wrappers) to ensure no hidden string operations are performed on the pointed-to object.\n- any macros/inline functions used in the above symbols (inclusions): Any macro expansions or inline functions referenced by the symbols listed above (including header includes) must be inspected because the MISRA string rule is about uses of <string.h> functions; an indirect call or macro expansion could introduce strcpy/memcpy/etc. The listed symbols are the only program identifiers referenced by OS_Milli2Ticks \u2014 verifying their definitions is sufficient to conclude whether the target function (directly or indirectly via macros/inline code) invokes any string.h routines or could access out-of-bounds memory via those routines."
