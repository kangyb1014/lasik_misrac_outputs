  "explanation": "To decide whether either branch of the if (num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX) is provably unreachable you must know all symbols that affect the computed value num_of_ticks and the comparison threshold. Each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: the definition of this global (structure/variable) is required so the analyzer can locate the TicksPerSecond member and any associated documentation/constraints.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: the type, compile-time value (if constant) or runtime range/limits of TicksPerSecond directly determine the maximum possible num_of_ticks when multiplied by milli_seconds. If TicksPerSecond is bounded (for example <= 1000) this may make the else branch unreachable; if unbounded or large it may make the else branch reachable.\n\n- INT_MAX: the concrete value of INT_MAX on the target platform (from limits.h) is the comparison threshold. Whether num_of_ticks can exceed INT_MAX depends on this value.\n\n- typedef:uint32 (width/maximum): the definition and maximum value of type uint32 (milli_seconds' type) are needed to compute the maximum possible multiplicand.\n\n- typedef:uint64 (width/maximum): the definition of uint64 (used to hold the product) is needed to understand overflow behavior and the upper bound of num_of_ticks computation.\n\n- typedef:int32 (width/maximum): the definition of int32 used by the function's return type is useful for cross-checking assumptions about integer sizes in this codebase (some projects define int32 != int). It helps ensure the analysis uses the intended integer widths.\n\n- type and width of int (platform INT_MAX/behavior): although INT_MAX is listed separately, explicitly knowing whether 'int' is 32-bit and its signedness/limits clarifies whether casting (int)num_of_ticks is well-defined when num_of_ticks<=INT_MAX.\n\n- caller / API contract for milli_seconds (allowed input range): any project-level preconditions or runtime constraints on the milli_seconds argument (for example that callers never pass > X) can render the else branch unreachable even if the raw type would allow larger values. The analyzer must consider such contracts.\n\nOther symbols in the function (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, the literal 999) do not affect reachability of the if/else branch and therefore are not required to determine potential unreachable code for this conditional."
