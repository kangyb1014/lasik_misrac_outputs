  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists only of declarations, initialization (return_code = OS_SUCCESS), and the final return statement, none of which by themselves introduce unreachable code. There are no statements following a return, no unconditional jumps (goto/longjmp) or conditional compilations in the snippet that would create unreachable regions. The only locations where reachability depends on platform/configuration or on the runtime range of values are the calculation of num_of_ticks and the subsequent if/else branch that assigns *ticks or sets error \u2014 these are the places that could conceivably make one branch never taken (and thus unreachable) depending on constants such as INT_MAX, the range of milli_seconds, and OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond. Therefore only the two fragments above need investigation for potential unreachable-code violations of MISRA C Rule 2.1."
