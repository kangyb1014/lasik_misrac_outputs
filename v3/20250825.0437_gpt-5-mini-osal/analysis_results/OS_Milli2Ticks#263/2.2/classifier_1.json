  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Milli2Ticks:\n```c\nint32 OS_Milli2Ticks(uint32 milli_seconds, int *ticks)\n{\n    uint64 num_of_ticks;\n    int32  return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n\n    num_of_ticks = (((uint64)milli_seconds * OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond) + 999) / 1000;\n\n    /* Check against maximum int32 (limit from some OS's) */\n    if (num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX)\n    {\n        *ticks = (int)num_of_ticks;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n        *ticks      = 0;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nnum_of_ticks = (((uint64)milli_seconds * OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond) + 999) / 1000;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Every operation in the expression contributes to the computed value: the (uint64) cast prevents 32-bit overflow during multiplication, the multiplication by OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond is required, the +999 implements the intended rounding-up semantics, and the division by 1000 scales to seconds. Removing any of these operations would change the program behaviour, so this is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
