Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for potential dead code because they are clearly used in the function behaviour: the local declaration of num_of_ticks is consumed by the computation and the subsequent test; the function parameters are used; the final return is dependent on earlier assignments. There are no unreachable constructs (no early return, no unconditional infinite loops, no code after a return) visible in this function body. The fragments selected above are the only places where executed operations might be redundant or never affect observable behaviour depending on external configuration (e.g. ranges of milli_seconds or OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond), so they should be investigated."
