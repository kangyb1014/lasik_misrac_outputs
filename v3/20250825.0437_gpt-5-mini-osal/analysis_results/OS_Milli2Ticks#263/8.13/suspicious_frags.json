  "explanation": "All other lines in the function and the provided additional symbols do not introduce pointer-to-non-const usages that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The local variables (num_of_ticks, return_code), the arithmetic and casting expressions, the use of OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond (an object accessed via a structure, not via a pointer), the typedefs (int32, uint32, uint64) and the macros (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR) do not involve pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. Therefore they do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
