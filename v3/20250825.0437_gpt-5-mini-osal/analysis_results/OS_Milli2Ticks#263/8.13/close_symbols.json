  "explanation": "Each symbol is needed to determine whether the pointer parameter 'ticks' could/should be const-qualified (MISRA rule: pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) by establishing whether the function modifies the pointed-to object or whether external qualifiers/semantics force a non-const pointer:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: the declaration/definition of this global is required to inspect member types and qualifiers (e.g. whether the struct or its members are const/volatile) and to confirm that reading TicksPerSecond has no side effects that would affect whether 'ticks' must be non-const.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: the exact type and qualifiers of this field (e.g. uint32, const, volatile) are needed to reason about the arithmetic and any potential aliasing/qualification interactions that could affect whether the function needs to write through 'ticks'.\n\n- int32: typedef/definition of int32 is needed to know the function return type size/sign and how it is expected to be used; also to reason about whether returning a status is used instead of modifying a pointed object.\n\n- uint32 and uint64: these typedefs are required to understand integer conversion rules, the arithmetic performed to compute num_of_ticks, and whether any implicit conversions or promotions could affect the correctness of assigning to *ticks \u2014 which in turn bears on whether the function must write through the pointer (i.e. cannot be const).\n\n- INT_MAX: definition of this macro/constant is required to evaluate the comparison against num_of_ticks and to determine whether the function conditionally writes to *ticks or sets it to zero; this affects whether the pointer is actually modified.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: the values and semantics of these status constants are needed to understand how the function reports results (via return code vs. output parameter). This helps decide whether the API could be designed to avoid writing through the pointer (e.g. by returning the tick count rather than using an output pointer), and thus whether 'ticks' could be const-qualified.\n\nNote: The single, decisive fact for the MISRA rule is whether the function writes to *ticks. The provided source shows an assignment to *ticks, so 'ticks' must not be const. The symbols above are supplied so the next agent can fully verify that behavior (types, qualifiers and borderline cases) in the broader project context."
