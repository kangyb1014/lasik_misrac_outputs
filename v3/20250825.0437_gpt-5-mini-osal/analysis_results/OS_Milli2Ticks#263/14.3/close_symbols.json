Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_SharedGlobalVars (type/definition): The struct/type that contains TicksPerSecond is required to locate the member and determine whether the member is a compile-time constant, has internal linkage, or is mutable \u2014 this affects whether the controlling expression could be an invariant.\\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond (declaration, type, const/volatile qualification, and range): The exact declaration (type and any const/volatile qualifiers) and its value/range are needed to determine the possible values of num_of_ticks. If TicksPerSecond were a compile-time constant or otherwise invariant, the comparison against INT_MAX might become invariant. Also the numeric range is necessary to compute worst-case num_of_ticks.\\n- uint32 (typedef): The type of milli_seconds (uint32) determines its maximum value; the typedef definition (width) is needed when calculating the upper bound of the computed num_of_ticks.\\n- uint64 (typedef): The cast to uint64 and its width define the arithmetic domain and whether the multiplication ((uint64)milli_seconds * TicksPerSecond) can overflow or is well-defined, which affects whether the comparison result can vary.\\n- int32 (typedef): Definition of int32 clarifies the expected semantics/assumptions about return type and any implicit relationships to INT_MAX on the platform.\\n- INT_MAX (limits.h): The numeric value used in the controlling expression must be known to decide whether num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX can ever be always-true or always-false for all possible inputs.\\n- UINT32_MAX / UINT64_MAX (limits for overflow bounding): The maximum values for the unsigned types let you compute strict upper bounds for num_of_ticks (given max milli_seconds and TicksPerSecond) to determine whether the comparison with INT_MAX is invariant.\\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as OS_SUCCESS or OS_ERROR do not affect whether the controlling expression is invariant, so they are not required for this MISRA rule analysis.)"
