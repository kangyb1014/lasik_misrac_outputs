  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Milli2Ticks can (directly or indirectly) call itself you must inspect any symbols used in the function that could hide or expand to function calls. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars (definition / type and any associated accessors/macros): The global object could be implemented in a way that invokes code when accessed (for example via accessor macros, inline functions, or function-pointer wrappers). You must see the definition to confirm that reading its member is a plain data access and not a call.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond (declaration): The specific member referenced might be a macro, an accessor, or a function pointer; inspecting its declaration shows whether evaluation of this expression could invoke a function (which might then lead to indirect recursion).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/enum/constant definition): Macro definitions can expand to function calls or expressions with calls. Confirming its definition rules out hidden calls introduced by the constant used as the return value.\n\n- OS_ERROR (macro/enum/constant definition): Same rationale as OS_SUCCESS \u2014 ensure the symbol is a simple constant and does not expand to code that calls functions.\n\n- uint32, uint64, int32 (typedef / macro definitions): These type names could be implemented as macros or aliasing mechanisms that might hide function-like constructs in unusual codebases. Inspecting their definitions ensures casts and types do not expand into calls.\n\n- INT_MAX (macro definition from limits.h or project header): Although normally a simple macro constant, macros can be redefined; verify it is a plain constant and not a macro with side effects or calls.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions of any global/object, macro, or typedef referenced in the function to ensure none expand to or invoke functions (directly or indirectly). If all of the above are ordinary constants/typedefs and OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond is a plain data member read, then OS_Milli2Ticks contains no calls and cannot recursively call itself."
