  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by pointer parameters to string.h functions. This function does not call any of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn), so there are no direct string.h calls to inspect. The only buffer in this function is 'copyblock' and the only pointer-based memory operations are the OS_read/OS_write calls and the indexed access &copyblock[wr_total]; those are the only places where out-of-bounds accesses could occur and therefore are listed above for investigation. Other fragments (OS_OpenCreate, OS_close, OS_ObjectIdDefined, OS_CHECK_POINTER, return code handling, variable declarations and loop structure outside the inner write loop) do not perform pointer arithmetic or call string.h functions and thus do not present a risk under Rule 21.17 and do not need to be investigated for that specific rule."
