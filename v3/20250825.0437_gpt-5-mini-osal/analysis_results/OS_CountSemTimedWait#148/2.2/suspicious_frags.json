  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged because they contain operations that are candidates for \"dead code\" investigation (assignments or small functions that may be executed but could be redundant or removable without changing observable behavior). Specifically:\n\n- The static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken function is a very small accessor; if it is not referenced elsewhere in the project it would be dead code and should be investigated.\n\n- The explicit initialization of return_code to OS_ERROR at the start of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken may be redundant if every control path assigns return_code prior to any use/return; this should be checked to ensure the initial assignment is necessary.\n\n- In OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl the temporary variable result is assigned one of three constants and then returned. If all callers only see the returned value, the intermediate assignments may be removable (replaced by direct returns); investigate whether the variable and its assignments are truly needed or represent removable operations.\n\n- In OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel the assignment token->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE after unlocking may be redundant depending on how the token is used after cancellation; if the token is discarded or re-initialized by the caller, the assignment may be unnecessary.\n\n- The initialization token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(-1) (in OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit) is an assignment that may be overwritten before any use in typical call paths; although this looks like initialization, confirm whether it is required (for example in error paths) or is redundant.\n\nWhy other fragments were not reported:\n- The calls that perform global locking/unlocking, refcount increments, and active_id updates in OS_ObjectIdConvertToken are control- and state-affecting operations. They influence concurrency, object lifetime and error recovery, so they are not dead even if some assignments look duplicated or conditional.\n\n- The memset(token, 0, sizeof(*token)) in OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit is an initialization, and per the MISRA note initialization is not considered an assignment candidate for dead code; it is needed to ensure a known token state.\n\n- The logic in OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex and the retry loop in OS_ObjectIdConvertToken contains checks, calls and state updates that affect program behavior (locking, waiting, state-change semantics). They are not candidates for removal simply because they look verbose.\n\n- The arithmetic and carry adjustment in OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime (tv_nsec overflow handling) is necessary to compute a correct absolute timespec; removing it would change behavior.\n\n- The mapping of sem_timedwait errors to OS return codes in OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl is behaviorally significant and was not flagged; only the use of the temporary result variable (which is a stylistic/optimization candidate) was flagged.\n\nIf desired, I can expand each flagged fragment with the exact source locations/callers to help determine whether the operations are actually dead in the full project context."
