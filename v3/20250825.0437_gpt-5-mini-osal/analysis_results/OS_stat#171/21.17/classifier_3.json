  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not call any <string.h> functions, so as written it does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (is_rule_violated = false). However a violation can occur in the called function: if OS_FileStat_Impl uses standard string functions on the local_path or on buffers inside *filestats without proper bounds/termination checks, accesses beyond object bounds can result. Concrete examples: (1) OS_TranslatePath fails to NUL\u2011terminate local_path when the input path is too long; OS_FileStat_Impl then calls strlen(local_path) or strcpy(dest, local_path) and the strlen/strcpy reads past local_path[] bounds (over\u2011read) or strcpy writes past dest bounds (over\u2011write). (2) OS_FileStat_Impl calls memcpy(..., local_path, n) with n > OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN. These scenarios would violate Rule 21.17, but the single fragment shown does not by itself violate the rule."
