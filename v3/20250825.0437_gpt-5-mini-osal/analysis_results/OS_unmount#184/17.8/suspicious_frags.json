  "explanation": "No other code in the function modifies the parameter variable 'mountpoint' itself (no assignments to mountpoint, no passing of &mountpoint). The remaining operations only read mountpoint or operate on local variables (return_code, token, filesys) or modify filesys->flags (a separate object), so they do not implicate Rule 17.8. The use of sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) is evaluated at compile time and does not access/modify filesys. Calls that operate on local objects (e.g., OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(&token), OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token)) do not involve the mountpoint parameter. Therefore only the macro invocation (which may perform checks) and the call that casts away const and passes mountpoint as a void* need investigation to ensure the pointer parameter and/or the object it points to are not being improperly modified."
