  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The code uses only standard C constructs: function calls, pointer casts, macros (including the common do { ... } while (0) macro idiom), bitwise operations, array indexing, and forward struct declaration. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as inline assembly, __attribute__ or other __prefixed identifiers, typeof, statement expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, computed gotos, designated initializer extensions, or other vendor-specific features. The cast (void *)mountpoint discards constness but is a standard C cast, not a compiler extension (it may be relevant to other MISRA rules but not Rule 1.2). Therefore no code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
