  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the target function or the provided related code. The only potential string storage is the task_name field in OS_task_internal_record_t, but there are no operations shown that read from or write to that buffer using C string/library routines. The code fragment that obtains a task pointer (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) indexes the OS_task_table using an index produced by OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, which constrains the index with a modulo by the object-type maximum (ensuring it is within bounds); OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex also performs parameter checks. The assignment task->delete_hook_pointer = function_pointer is a simple pointer assignment and does not involve string handling. Therefore there are no code fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in the provided code."
