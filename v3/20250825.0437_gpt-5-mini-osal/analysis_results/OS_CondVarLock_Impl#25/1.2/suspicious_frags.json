  "explanation": "No language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C syntax: a function definition, local variable declarations, pointer dereference (*token), a macro invocation (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) and a call to the POSIX pthreads API (pthread_mutex_lock). None of the following compiler-specific extensions appear: identifiers or keywords with leading double underscores, __attribute__, __builtin_* functions, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions, inline assembly (asm), __extension__, or other documented compiler extensions. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a preprocessor construct; its expansion is not shown, so there is no evidence in this fragment that it uses a compiler language extension. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
