  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that assign to or otherwise modify any of the function parameters (token, data, size, flags). Specific reasoning:\n- There are no assignments to token, data, size, or flags anywhere in the function body.\n- The macro usage OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_queue_table, *token) ultimately evaluates to &OS_impl_queue_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)]. This takes the address of the dereferenced token object but does not modify the token pointer itself.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const OS_object_token_t * and only reads token->obj_idx; it does not modify the parameter or the object.\n- The data parameter is passed (read-only) to mq_timedsend, which takes a const message pointer; the pointer and its target are not modified in this function.\n- size and flags are only read (no writes or updates).\n- Local variables (impl, ts, result, return_code) are used and modified, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, no fragments require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
