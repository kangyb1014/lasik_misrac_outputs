  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n\n- The do/while loop (mq_timedsend retry on EINTR) is reachable and required: the body executes at least once and the loop may repeat while result == -1 and errno == EINTR.\n- After the loop there are three mutually exclusive outcomes that are all potentially reachable:\n  - result == 0 (successful send) is reachable when mq_timedsend succeeds.\n  - result == -1 with errno == ETIMEDOUT is reachable if the timed send times out (the code intentionally uses a zero timespec to force a non-blocking attempt / immediate timeout in some implementations).\n  - result == -1 with some other errno is reachable for other error conditions (EINVAL, EBADF, EMSGSIZE, EAGAIN, etc.), so the final else branch is reachable.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET usage and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken invocation do not introduce unreachable code; they compute an index and fetch the table entry and are executed before the loop.\n- There are no subsequent statements after an unconditional return that would make code unreachable in this function.\n\nGiven these points, there are no obvious unreachable code fragments to flag for MISRA C Rule 2.1 investigation."
