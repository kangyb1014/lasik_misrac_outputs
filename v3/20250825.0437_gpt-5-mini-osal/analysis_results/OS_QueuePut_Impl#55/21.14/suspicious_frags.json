  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_QueuePut_Impl and the related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp in the function or in the provided macros/inline functions. The only standard-library-like functions used are memset (initializing struct timespec) and mq_timedsend (message queue send) \u2014 neither is a string-comparison function and neither uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings in this code. There are also no uses of strcmp/strncmp or any explicit comparison of null-terminated strings in the supplied code. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and nothing needs to be further investigated for this rule in the provided snippets."
