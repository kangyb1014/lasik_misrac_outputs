  "explanation": "I examined all pointer usages in the provided code. The only pointer-to-non-const parameters are sock_id (osal_id_t *sock_id) and object_id (osal_id_t *object_id). Both are written to in their respective functions (*object_id = token.obj_id; and OS_SocketGetIdByName is an output/get-by-name API), so they must be non-const (outputs) and do not violate Rule 8.13. All input string parameters that could be const-qualified (sock_name and name) are already declared as const char *. The address-of usages (&token) are for tokens returned/modified by internal APIs and hence correctly non-const. The pointer-check macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) only test for NULL and do not change the pointee type. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
