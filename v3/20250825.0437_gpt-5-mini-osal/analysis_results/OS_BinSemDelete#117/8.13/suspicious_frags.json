  "explanation": "I did not find code fragments that obviously violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the supplied snippets. Rationale for not flagging the pointer usages in the provided code: \n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., OS_object_token_t *token): The token argument is written to (token->obj_idx, token->obj_id) and used to start/abort a transaction; therefore it must be a non-const pointer and is correct as written.\n\n- OS_BinSemDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token): This function already takes the token as a pointer-to-const and does not modify the token, so it follows the rule.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token): The function reads token->obj_id but also calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id). That finish routine is expected to operate on the token (e.g. to release locks or update state), so token must remain non-const; making it const would likely be incorrect. Without the implementation of OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish there is no evidence this pointer could safely be const.\n\n- sem pointer in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl (OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem) and the addresses passed to pthread_cond_destroy/pthread_mutex_destroy: the code performs destructive operations on the semaphore record (destroying the cond var and mutex), so non-const pointers are appropriate.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token): already const-qualified and correct.\n\nGiven the visible reads/writes and calls to other routines that presumably mutate the pointed objects, there is no clear candidate where a pointer should be changed to point to a const-qualified type. If you can provide implementations (or prototypes) of the called routines such as OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish or OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, I can re-evaluate whether any parameter could be declared const."
