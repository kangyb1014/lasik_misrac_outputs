  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions found. All if statements (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)) use the variable return_code whose value is set by function calls (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken). Although OS_SUCCESS is a macro constant (0), the comparisons are between a variable and a constant, so the controlling expressions are not invariant. There are no loops with constant conditions (no while(1), for(;;), or do-while with a constant controlling expression) in the provided code. Therefore, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
