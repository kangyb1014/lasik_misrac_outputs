  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so *token has type const OS_object_token_t and &( *token ) (the expansion of the macro) yields a const OS_object_token_t * \u2014 no const qualifier is dropped. However, a violation would occur if the macro or the called function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken expects a non-const pointer (e.g. prototype OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(OS_object_token_t *)), because that would require discarding the const qualifier when passing &(*token), which would violate Rule 8.13."
