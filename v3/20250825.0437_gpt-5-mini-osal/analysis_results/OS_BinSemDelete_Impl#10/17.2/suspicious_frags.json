  "explanation": "No code fragments in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl appear to call OS_BinSemDelete_Impl either directly or indirectly. The only function-like invocations inside the function are:\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token) which expands to &OS_impl_bin_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]. The called inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and contains no further calls.\n- pthread_cond_destroy(&(sem->cv)) and pthread_mutex_destroy(&(sem->id)), which are standard POSIX API calls and do not call back into application-level semaphore delete logic (they do not invoke OS_BinSemDelete_Impl).\nThere are no other function calls or callbacks in the fragment (only accesses to sem->cv and sem->id and simple control flow). Therefore there is no direct or indirect recursion to investigate in this function."
