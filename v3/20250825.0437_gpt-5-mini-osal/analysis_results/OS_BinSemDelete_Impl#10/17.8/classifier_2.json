  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the parameter 'token' is declared as a pointer to const and is not modified. The macro call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) only reads/dereferences the token to compute an index; neither the pointer nor the object referred to by token is assigned to within the function. The code modifies the semaphore record (sem), not the parameter itself, which is allowed."
