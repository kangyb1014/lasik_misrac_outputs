  "explanation": "The only function parameter in the target function is the pointer 'token'. MISRA Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying a function parameter (and for pointer parameters, forbids modifying the pointer itself). There are no assignments to 'token' and no other uses of 'token' in the function body besides the single macro invocation, so the function signature and that macro call are the only places that could possibly involve modification of the parameter. The macro definition is included because it takes the address of its parameter token expression (&(tok)) which can alter how an expression like '*token' is interpreted \u2014 it must be checked that this does not result in modifying the pointer parameter. All other lines in the function (pthread_cond_destroy, pthread_mutex_destroy, return_code handling, and accesses to 'sem' fields) do not reference or modify 'token' and therefore do not need to be investigated for compliance with Rule 17.8."
