  "explanation": "To decide if this function violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp for null-terminated strings you must know: (1) the exact declaration of UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t (so you can see TypeName and Genre members used by the function). In particular you must see the declaration/type of TypeName to determine whether it is a null-terminated C string (the MISRA rule applies only to null-terminated strings). (2) The Genre member type and the UT_ValueGenre_t enum (and the UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE constant) are needed to understand the fallback branch logic \u2014 while not directly related to memcmp, they affect whether the strcmp path is actually exercised and are necessary for complete analysis. (3) The strcmp symbol must be examined to ensure the code uses strcmp (allowed) and to check whether strcmp is a macro or alias that expands to memcmp on this build/platform. (4) The memcmp symbol/prototype should be available to detect any direct use in this function or to determine if any used string comparison resolves to memcmp. These symbols together let an analyst determine whether a forbidden memcmp-on-NT-string is present (directly or indirectly via macro/alias)."
