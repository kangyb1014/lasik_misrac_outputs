  "explanation": "I inspected the entire UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible function and related symbols. There are no calls to memcmp (direct or via an obvious wrapper) anywhere in the function. The only string comparison used is strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName) which is the correct Standard Library function for comparing null-terminated strings; Rule 21.14 prohibits memcmp for null-terminated strings, but no memcmp usage is present. The code also performs explicit NULL checks on the string pointers before calling strcmp, so there is no risk of passing NULL to the string comparison routine. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
