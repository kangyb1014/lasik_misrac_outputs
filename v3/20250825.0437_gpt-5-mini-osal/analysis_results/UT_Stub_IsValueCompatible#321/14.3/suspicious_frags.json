  "explanation": "I examined all controlling expressions in the function. There are two if statements: \n- if (Rvc->TypeName != NULL && WantTypeName != NULL) \u2014 this depends on the pointer values passed into the function (runtime), so it is not an invariant. \n- if (!IsCompatible && Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE && Rvc->Genre == WantGenre) \u2014 this depends on the computed variable IsCompatible and the runtime fields Rvc->Genre and the parameter WantGenre, so it is not an invariant.\nThere are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other controlling expressions that evaluate to compile-time constants. The MISRA exceptions (infinite-loop invariants and do-while false constant) are not applicable. Therefore no controlling expressions in this code need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
