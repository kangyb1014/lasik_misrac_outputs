Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible is invariant, the analyzer needs the concrete definitions/values of the following symbols:\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The struct definition is required to know the types and semantics of the members being tested. Without the struct layout an analyzer cannot determine whether the tested members are constant, computed, or subject to change at runtime.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName: The exact type and declaration of the TypeName member (e.g., const char * vs embedded array vs macro-expanded constant) determine whether the expression (Rvc->TypeName != NULL && WantTypeName != NULL) can ever vary. If TypeName is always NULL (or always non-NULL) due to its definition/initialization policy, the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::Genre: The type and semantics of Genre are needed to assess the second conditional. If Genre is fixed by the struct definition or initialization, comparisons involving Rvc->Genre could be invariant.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The enum/type that Genre uses is needed to know the possible values and ranges for Rvc->Genre and WantGenre. This is required to determine whether expressions like Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE && Rvc->Genre == WantGenre can be true sometimes or are always true/false.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The actual enumerator/value for this symbol is required to evaluate the comparison Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE; if this enumerator equals a value that Genre cannot take, the expression could be invariant.\n\n- strcmp: The behavior and return convention of strcmp (returns zero when strings compare equal) is needed to interpret (strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName) == 0). While strcmp is standard, an analyzer must know that its result depends on runtime string contents (so that equality is not a compile-time invariant) unless TypeName/WantedTypeName are known constants.\n\n- NULL: The definition/representation of NULL (macro) is needed to reason about pointer comparisons to NULL. Also, whether TypeName or WantTypeName may be statically set to NULL depends on project conventions or definitions tied to NULL.\n\nTogether these symbols allow an analyzer to determine whether each controlling expression depends on non-constant runtime data (and so is not invariant) or is provably constant (thus potentially violating the MISRA rule)."
