Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (function signature, local variable declaration, comments and the final return statement) are not listed because they are necessary for the function interface, hold the result, document intent, or are the natural return of computed state \u2014 they are reachable and materially affect behavior. The three included fragments should be investigated because their assignments/conditions may be redundant or never affect observable behavior depending on surrounding code and definitions (e.g. possible invariant values of TypeName or Genre), which could indicate dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
