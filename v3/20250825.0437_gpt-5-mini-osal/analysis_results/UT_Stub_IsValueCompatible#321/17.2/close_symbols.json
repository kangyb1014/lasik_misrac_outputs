  "explanation": "- strcmp: This is the only function called directly by UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible. To decide if the target function violates the MISRA rule against recursion you must inspect strcmp's implementation (or its mapping in the build) to ensure it does not call back into UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible (directly or indirectly).\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The structure type of the Rvc parameter. You need its definition to confirm that accessing Rvc->TypeName and Rvc->Genre cannot cause an indirect function call (for example, via macro magic or embedded function pointers that might be invoked elsewhere). Knowing the struct layout also lets you check for any function-pointer members that could enable indirect recursion in other code paths.\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The enum/typedef for the Genre field. Include its definition to ensure evaluating or comparing Genre values does not rely on functions or macros that could introduce recursion.\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The specific enumerator/constant used in the comparison. Its definition/site must be checked to ensure it is a simple constant and not defined in terms of a function-like macro or inline function that could cause calls.\n- UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible: The target function itself must be included so the analyser can detect any direct self-call occurrences and to serve as the root when checking the call graph for indirect recursion."
