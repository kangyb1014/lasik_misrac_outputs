  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls).\n\nReasons:\n- The function body contains only one external function call: strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName). strcmp is a standard library function and does not call UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible, so there is no direct recursion.\n- There are no calls to any other project functions that could form an indirect recursion cycle. The code does not call any other user-defined functions.\n- There are no function-pointer invocations or callbacks in this function. Although the struct UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t contains fields (e.g., Buf), none of those fields are used to invoke a function here, so they cannot introduce indirect recursion from this function.\n- No macros or other constructs in the provided code expand to calls to UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided function that warrant investigation for self-calls (direct or indirect) under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
