Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t (struct definition)\n  - Reason: This function indexes Rvc->TypeName and Rvc->Genre. To be sure the target function itself does not implicitly expand into loops (via macros in struct members) or reference objects that could be loop counters or be modified in a for loop body, you must see the full struct definition (member types and any annotations/macros). Also required to determine whether any member access could invoke function-like behavior (unlikely but possible via macros).\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t (typedef/enum definition)\n  - Reason: The Genre field is compared against WantGenre and UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE. Knowing whether UT_ValueGenre_t is an enum, a macro, or some type with overloaded semantics (e.g. volatile, bit-field, or accessor macros) is necessary to ensure no hidden side effects or implicit loop-related behavior occurs.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE (enumerator / constant)\n  - Reason: The code checks Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE; if that symbol is a macro or function-like expression it could expand to code with loops or side effects. The exact definition is needed to rule out hidden for loops or modifications to loop counters/objects.\n\n- strcmp (declaration and implementation / macro expansion)\n  - Reason: The function calls strcmp. To evaluate the MISRA rule about for loops you must know whether strcmp is an actual function (no inline-for-loop into this translation unit) or defined as a macro/inline that expands into loop(s) inside this function body. If strcmp expands into code that contains a for loop, that loop must be checked for the three clauses and single loop-counter constraints and for whether objects modified in the body conflict with the loop counter. Therefore you need the declaration and the implementation/macro expansion visible to the analyser.\n\n- NULL (macro definition)\n  - Reason: NULL could be a macro with unexpected expansion in some environments. Confirming its definition rules out any macro expansion that could introduce statements or loops into the conditionals.\n\n- bool, true, false (stdbool.h or equivalent definitions)\n  - Reason: The boolean type and literals appear in the function. In some embedded or legacy environments these may be macros or typedefs with side-effects; confirming their definitions rules out any accidental macro expansion that could hide loops/behaviour violating MISRA for-loops.\n\n- Type of Rvc->TypeName (usually const char * / member declaration)\n  - Reason: The code uses strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName). If TypeName is not a plain pointer but instead is implemented via accessor macros or has special behaviour (e.g. a structure with an implicit getter macro), that could introduce code (loops) at the call site. Knowing the exact member type/definition rules this out.\n\n- Headers that may define strcmp as macro or inline (e.g. <string.h> implementation details)\n  - Reason: Some standard-library implementations provide macro wrappers or inlines for performance; these may expand into code containing for loops. To be certain the target function does not contain (after preprocessing/compilation) any for statements, the analyzer must inspect the relevant headers/implementations that will be used in the build.\n\nSummary: The target function source as shown contains no for loops, but MISRA's rule requires considering behaviour of any code that becomes part of the function (including macro expansions and inlined functions). The listed symbols let an analyzer verify that no hidden or expanded definitions introduce for loops or side effects that would cause a for-statement well-formedness violation."
