  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The function only reads from the parameters: it dereferences Rvc to read fields (allowed; modifying the pointed-to object is permitted), compares pointers against NULL, calls strcmp using the pointer values (no modification), and compares the value-parameter WantGenre. There are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like Rvc = ..., WantTypeName = ..., or WantGenre = ...). The only assignment present is to the local variable IsCompatible. Additionally, Rvc is a pointer to const, preventing modification of the pointed-to object in this function. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this code."
