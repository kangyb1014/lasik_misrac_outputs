  "explanation": "- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The full typedef/struct definition must be inspected to detect any compiler-specific or non\u2011standard extensions used in its declaration (anonymous/extension members, __attribute__, nonstandard storage\u2011class keywords, etc.).\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t.TypeName: The member type for TypeName (e.g., char * vs compiler extension) must be known to ensure no extension is used for this field.\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t.Genre: The member type for Genre must be checked (bitfields, nonstandard width specifiers, attributes) to detect language extensions.\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The underlying definition (enum, typedef, or other) must be reviewed to verify it is standard C and not a compiler extension.\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The enumerator/constant definition is needed to confirm it is a normal standard enum/constant and not produced by an extension.\n- bool / true / false: These identifiers may come from <stdbool.h> (standard C99) or from a compiler typedef/macro/extension. Inspecting their definition determines whether a language extension is being used.\n- strcmp: Confirming the declaration/definition source ensures it is the standard library function and not a macro or compiler\u2011specific replacement.\n- NULL: The NULL macro definition must be checked to ensure it comes from the standard headers and is not a nonstandard extension.\n- <stdbool.h>, <string.h>, <stddef.h>: The standard header definitions for bool/true/false, strcmp and NULL should be referenced to determine whether the code relies on standard C facilities or on compiler/vendor extensions.\n\nCollectively these symbols allow an analyst to examine whether any of the types, macros or functions used by UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible are defined using compiler-specific language extensions (the MISRA concern) rather than standard C constructs."
