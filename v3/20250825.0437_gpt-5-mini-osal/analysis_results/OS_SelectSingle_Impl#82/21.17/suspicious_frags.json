  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in this routine (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or similar). The code only uses FD_* macros, integer and pointer operations, and a call to OS_DoSelect. The FD_SET/FD_ZERO/FD_ISSET usage is guarded by an impl->fd >= FD_SETSIZE check which prevents out-of-bounds access into the fd_set bitmask (so these macros do not raise a Rule 21.17 concern here). The call to OS_DoSelect and the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro do not themselves indicate any use of string.h functions in this fragment. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
