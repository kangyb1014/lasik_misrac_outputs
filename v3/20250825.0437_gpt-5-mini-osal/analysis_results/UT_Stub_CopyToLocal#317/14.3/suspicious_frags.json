  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The code contains only if statements and no loop constructs with constant conditions:\n\n- if (StubPtr != NULL): depends on the runtime result of UT_GetStubEntry \u2014 not a compile-time constant.\n- if (MaxSize < ActualCopy): depends on runtime values MaxSize and ActualCopy (ActualCopy is computed at runtime) \u2014 not invariant.\n- if (StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position >= StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize): depends on buffer position/size updated at runtime \u2014 not invariant.\n\nThere are no while/for/do-while loops with constant controlling expressions, and none of the conditionals use literal constants or integer constant expressions that would make them invariant. Therefore there are no fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
