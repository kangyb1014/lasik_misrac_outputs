  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Specifically:\n- LocalBuffer is passed to memcpy as the destination; this modifies the object pointed to by the pointer (which is permitted by the rule) but the pointer LocalBuffer itself is not reassigned or altered.\n- MaxSize and FuncKey are only read and not assigned to.\n- StubPtr and its Data.Buff.Position are modified, but StubPtr is a local variable obtained from UT_GetStubEntry and not a function parameter.\n- UT_ClearStubEntry is called with StubPtr (a local), so any modifications are to the stub table entry, not to the function parameters.\nTherefore none of the code fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, so there are no suspicious fragments to report."
