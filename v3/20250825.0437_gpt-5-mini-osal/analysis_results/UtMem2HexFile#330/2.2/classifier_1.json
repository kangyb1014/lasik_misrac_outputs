  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2HexFile:\n```c\nbool UtMem2HexFile(const void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE * fp;\n    uint32 i;\n    uint32 j;\n\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; i < Length; i += 16)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"   %06lX: \", (unsigned long)i);\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%02X \", ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]);\n                else\n                    fprintf(fp, \"   \");\n            }\n            fprintf(fp, \" \");\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%c\", isprint(((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]) ?

  "scenario": "When fopen fails (fp == NULL), the printf is executed to report the error (printing Filename and strerror(errno)). Removing this call would change program behaviour (diagnostic output and possibly timing), so the call is not dead code. The printf is reachable and executed in the error branch and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
