True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe UtAssert_True macro always calls UtAssert_GetContext(), but the provided implementation of UtAssert_GetContext(void) simply returns the global DefaultContext with no side effects. Each invocation of UtAssert_GetContext() therefore performs an operation whose removal (replacing the call by DefaultContext) would not affect program behaviour. Thus the call inside the macro is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtMem2HexFile:\n#define UtAssert_True(Expression, __VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(Expression,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent A is correct. Under the provided definitions, UtAssert_True expands to a function call UtAssert_GetContext() whose implementation simply returns the global DefaultContext and has no observable side effects. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. Replacing the call with the constant DefaultContext does not change behaviour (given the shown implementation), so the call qualifies as a dead operation and therefore violates Rule 2.2.\n\nNotes/mitigations: If UtAssert_GetContext is intended to be non-trivial in other build configurations (or to have timing/side effects), that must be documented and the implementation must actually provide those effects; otherwise remove the call (pass DefaultContext directly), make the function non-trivial, or document/justify the deviation from Rule 2.2 per the project\u2019s MISRA compliance process."
