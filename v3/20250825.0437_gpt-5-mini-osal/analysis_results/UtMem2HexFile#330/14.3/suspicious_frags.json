  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. Each control expression depends on a variable that can change at runtime:\n\n- if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\"))) \u2014 the assignment result depends on the runtime return value of fopen, not a constant.\n- for (i = 0; i < Length; i += 16) \u2014 the controlling expression i < Length depends on i (changed each iteration) and on Length (runtime value).\n- for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) (both occurrences) \u2014 the controlling expression j < 16 depends on j, which is modified on each iteration; it is not invariant even though it uses the constant 16.\n- if ((i + j) < Length) (both occurrences) \u2014 the expression depends on i and j (both changing across iterations) and on Length.\n\nNo do-while or explicit constant (e.g. while(1) or if (0)) controlling expressions are present. Therefore, there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) and nothing that requires further investigation for this specific rule."
