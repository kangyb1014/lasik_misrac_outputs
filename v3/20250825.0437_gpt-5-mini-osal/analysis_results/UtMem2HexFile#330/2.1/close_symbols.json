  "explanation": "To determine if any code in UtMem2HexFile is statically unreachable you must know the semantics (return/termination behavior) of the functions and the types used in control-flow expressions: \n\n- fopen: The if-condition depends on fopen returning a non-NULL FILE*. You must know if fopen can fail (return NULL) in the build/runtime environment; if fopen can never fail then the else branch would be unreachable. \n\n- fclose: Used in the \u2018then\u2019 branch; needed to verify that control returns normally after file operations (no abnormal termination inside the successful branch). \n\n- fprintf: Used extensively in both branches; if any fprintf variant is treated by the project as non-returning or is replaced by a wrapper with different control flow, it could affect reachability. \n\n- printf: Called in the else branch for the error path; same reason as fprintf \u2014 wrappers/semantics could change reachability. \n\n- strerror: Used to format the error message in the else branch; if it had non-standard behaviour that altered control flow it would matter for reachability of subsequent statements. \n\n- errno: The error reporting uses errno; you need to know whether errno is meaningful/modified by project-specific fopen wrapper (affects whether the error path is considered reachable). \n\n- isprint: Used in the inner loop to choose printable characters; if isprint were a macro or wrapper with unusual control-flow then reachability of the inner loops/prints could change. \n\n- UtAssert_True: Crucial \u2014 this assertion is called in the error path with false. If UtAssert_True is implemented as a non-returning failure handler (e.g., it aborts/longjmps/does not return), then the subsequent return false statement would be unreachable; if it returns normally the return false is reachable. You must know its semantics/attributes (noreturn or not). \n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Present in the static call graph and likely used by assert machinery. Its presence/semantics may indicate whether the assert infrastructure terminates execution or returns, which affects reachability of code after UtAssert_True. \n\n- FILE: The FILE type definition may be project-wrapped; knowing its definition (and whether fopen can be defined away) helps determine whether the fopen check is meaningful. \n\n- uint8, uint32: The typedefs used for indexing and pointer arithmetic affect loop bounds and casts; if these are defined in a non-standard way (e.g., as macros that change signedness/size) they could make loops trivially empty or the arithmetic undefined, which could create unreachable loop bodies.\n\nIncluding these symbols (and their project-specific implementations/attributes) in the next-agent prompt lets that agent decide whether either branch or particular statements are provably unreachable under the project's definitions and build-time assumptions."
