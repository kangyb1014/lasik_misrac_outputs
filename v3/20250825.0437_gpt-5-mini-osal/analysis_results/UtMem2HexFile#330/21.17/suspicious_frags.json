  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in UtMem2HexFile. The only memory accesses that could read from the Memory buffer are via ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j], and every such access is guarded by the condition (i + j) < Length before indexing, preventing out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads. Other string/IO functions used (fopen, fprintf, fclose, printf, strerror, isprint) are not the <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17 and are not called with pointers in a way that would violate this rule. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
