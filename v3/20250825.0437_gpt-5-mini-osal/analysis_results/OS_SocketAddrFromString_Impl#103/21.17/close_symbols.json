  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can lead to out-of-bounds accesses (the MISRA string\u2011handling/bounds rule), the analyzer must know exactly what buffer is passed to inet_pton and how large that buffer is relative to what inet_pton may write. For that the following symbols are required:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t\n  - Required to know the size and lifetime of the object pointed to by Addr and to confirm that Addr->AddrData exists and is large enough for the accessor overlay.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t\n  - Needed to see how AddrData is reinterpreted: whether Accessor->sa, sa_in and sa_in6 fields actually map into Addr->AddrData and do not point outside the object.\n\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t) and its size/layout\n  - To verify that taking &Addr->AddrData and casting to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t is valid and that the sin_addr/sin6_addr targets lie within the bounds of AddrData.\n\n- struct sockaddr / sa_family (sa_family_t)\n  - To interpret Accessor->sa.sa_family values correctly and determine which address family branch (AF_INET/AF_INET6) is taken.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and member sin_addr (type struct in_addr)\n  - To identify the exact field used for the IPv4 write target and its offset within the accessor and to obtain the size of the IPv4 buffer.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 and member sin6_addr (type struct in6_addr)\n  - To identify the IPv6 write target and its offset and size for the IPv6 branch.\n\n- struct in_addr (size/representation)\n  - inet_pton(AF_INET, ...) will write sizeof(struct in_addr) bytes; the analyzer must know that value (typically 4) to ensure the target buffer is at least that big.\n\n- struct in6_addr (size/representation)\n  - inet_pton(AF_INET6, ...) will write sizeof(struct in6_addr) bytes; the analyzer must know that value (typically 16) to ensure the target buffer is large enough.\n\n- inet_pton (prototype and documented semantics/required buffer sizes and return values)\n  - The function being called: the analyzer needs its precise contract (how many bytes it writes for each family, return semantics \u2014 success == 1) to conclude whether a buffer overflow is possible.\n\n- AF_INET, AF_INET6 macros\n  - To match the sa_family values in the switch and ensure the correct branch is selected by the runtime value; also to confirm the mapping to which buffer size inet_pton will expect.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (compile-time configuration macro)\n  - To know whether the AF_INET6 branch is present in the compiled code (affects whether IPv6 buffer-size analysis is required).\n\n(Other error code macros like OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS / OS_ERROR / OS_SUCCESS do not affect buffer bounds and are not required for this specific MISRA string-bounds analysis.)"
