  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is required to determine if a function parameter is modified):\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: Needed to see the exact declaration of the parameter Addr (its type, const-qualification of members if any, and the presence/type of AddrData). This determines whether any use of Addr in the function could be interpreted as modifying the parameter object itself.\n\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): Required to know the type/layout of Addr->AddrData (array, struct, pointer). Taking &Addr->AddrData could be interpreted differently depending on its type; this clarifies that the code is taking the address of a subobject (allowed) rather than assigning to the parameter variable.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The code casts &Addr->AddrData to this type and accesses fields (sa.sa_family, sa_in.sin_addr, sa_in6.sin6_addr). The accessor definition is needed to confirm that only subobjects of *Addr are read or written (permitted) and that no assignment to the parameter variable Addr or to the parameter pointer 'string' occurs via this accessor.\n\n- inet_pton: The prototype/signature is required to confirm its parameter types and semantics (it takes a const char *src and void *dst and returns an int). This ensures inet_pton cannot modify the pointer parameter 'string' itself (only the pointed-to destination object), so passing 'string' to inet_pton does not violate the rule.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: These macros/constants appear in the switch and are required to verify they are ordinary integer constants (not macros that expand to something that could modify parameters) and to understand which branch is taken; they help confirm that only reads occur from sa_family.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The return-code symbols are needed to ensure that no hidden side-effects occur via these identifiers/macros (e.g., they could be macros that expand to function calls or assignments). Confirming they are simple constants/macros ensures that the function's return statements do not modify the parameter variables.\n\nIn summary, these symbols allow verification that the code only reads Addr->... fields and writes into the object pointed to by a local void* (addrbuffer) or into subobjects of *Addr (which is permitted), and that neither the parameter pointer variables Addr nor string are assigned to or otherwise modified (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
