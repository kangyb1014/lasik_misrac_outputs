  "explanation": "For each symbol below, the analysis must confirm that neither the target function nor any macros/inline definitions it uses (nor functions it calls) rely on memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- inet_pton: The only function called by the target. Inspect its declaration/implementation on the target platform to determine whether it (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The type of Addr. Needed to check whether its definition contains macros, inline helpers, or embedded functions that may use memcmp when accessing fields (e.g., via AddrData accessors).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t::AddrData: The specific field that is being reinterpreted; its definition could be a macro/union triggering additional code that might use memcmp.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The accessor type used for the reinterpret cast. Its full definition must be checked for any macros/inline functions that could call memcmp.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t::sa: The embedded sockaddr member; examine its definition for hidden behaviors that might include memcmp usage.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t::sa.sa_family: The field tested in the switch. Needed to ensure accessing this field is a plain data read (no hidden calls) and to determine which branch is compiled/used.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t::sa_in.sin_addr and OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t::sa_in6.sin6_addr: The address buffers passed to inet_pton. Confirming these are plain data buffers (no wrappers/macros that use memcmp) and verify their types passed to inet_pton.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: The constants determine control flow (which address buffer is used). Also needed to know whether the IPv6 branch is present and relevant.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: Preprocessor symbol that controls inclusion of the IPv6 case. Needed to know which code path is actually present in the build and therefore whether additional symbols (sa_in6) matter for the memcmp check.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The return-code macros/constants. Verify they are simple constants (not macros that expand to expressions or function-like constructs that could use memcmp).\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To prove the target function does not violate it you must (a) inspect the function body for direct memcmp uses (none), (b) inspect any macros/inline/helpers involved in field access (types and fields above), and (c) inspect callee implementations (inet_pton). The symbols listed are the minimal set needed to perform those checks."
