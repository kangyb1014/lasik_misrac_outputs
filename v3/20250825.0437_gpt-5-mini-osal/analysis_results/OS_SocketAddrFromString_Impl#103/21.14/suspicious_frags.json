  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp in the provided target function or the related definitions. The only standard-library-like function called is inet_pton, which parses an address string into binary form and does not compare null-terminated strings via memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or other byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
