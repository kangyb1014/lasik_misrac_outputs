  "explanation": "For MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must prove whether the switch controlling expression (Accessor->sa.sa_family) or the if expression (inet_pton(... ) != 1) can be evaluated to a compile-time invariant. Each listed symbol is required as follows:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to see the type of the Addr parameter and, crucially, the declaration of AddrData. If AddrData is a compile-time constant, or if its layout forces sa_family to a fixed value, the switch could be invariant.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: needed to see how Accessor maps onto AddrData (e.g., if it is a union, different aliasing, padding, or fixed initialiser). This determines whether Accessor->sa.sa_family is modifiable at runtime or effectively constant.\n\n- Addr->AddrData (the exact type/definition): the concrete type of AddrData (union/struct/array) shows whether reading it as an OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t can yield a non-variant sa_family or whether aliasing rules/implicit initialisation might make it constant.\n\n- struct sockaddr (Accessor->sa and sa.sa_family type/definition): the type and member sa_family (including its typedef, e.g., sa_family_t) are required to know whether sa_family is an ordinary runtime-modifiable field or some constant/enum that could be invariant in the translation unit.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (Accessor->sa_in): needed because the code takes &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr for AF_INET; knowledge of this struct confirms that the switch is selecting based on a runtime field and whether that field overlaps other members.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (Accessor->sa_in6): same reason as sockaddr_in \u2014 also needed to confirm that the AF_INET6 case is meaningful and that sa_family can legitimately take that value at runtime.\n\n- AF_INET: required to confirm this constant's value and type (macro/enum). If AF_INET were defined in a way that makes the switch expression trivially equal (unlikely but possible in some builds), the switch could be invariant.\n\n- AF_INET6: same as AF_INET \u2014 plus to see whether AF_INET6 is defined or absent/aliased which could make the switch degenerate.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: this compile-time macro controls whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in. If IPV6 support is disabled, the switch might have only one valid case and could be considered degenerate/invariant in some static analyses; need to know its value for the build being analyzed.\n\n- inet_pton (declaration/definition or any macro that could replace it): the if expression compares the return of inet_pton to 1. To determine if the comparison is invariant, we must know whether inet_pton is an actual runtime function (non-constant) or if it has been replaced by a macro/inline that could be a compile-time constant in this build.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrFromString (caller) and its use/initialization of the Addr argument: to establish whether Addr (and thus sa_family) is initialized/assigned deterministically by the caller prior to calling the Impl function. If every call-site always passes an Addr whose sa_family is a fixed constant, the controlling expression could be invariant in the program's call contexts; the caller's code is required to check for that possibility.\n\nCollectively these symbols allow determination of whether the switch expression or the if expression can be reduced to an invariant in the analyzed translation unit/build configuration, and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
