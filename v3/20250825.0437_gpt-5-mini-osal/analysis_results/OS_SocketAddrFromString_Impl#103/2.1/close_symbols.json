  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to determine whether any code in OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl is unreachable under the project's actual definitions and preprocessing: \n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: the function parameter type; needed to see layout and whether the cast to the Accessor is valid and what fields exist. \n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the accessor type used after the cast; required to confirm the members referenced and control-flow reasoning inside the switch. \n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): the specific member being aliased by the Accessor cast; needed to verify the cast/aliasing and presence of fields used. \n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t.sa (member): sa.sa_family is the switch expression; its type and possible values affect which case labels are relevant. \n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t.sa_in (member): referenced in the AF_INET case; required to confirm that &sa_in.sin_addr is a valid lvalue and to reason about case reachability. \n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t.sa_in6 (member): referenced in the AF_INET6 case; required if IPv6 support is compiled in to analyze reachability of that case. \n- sin_addr (member of sa_in): target of addrbuffer assignment in AF_INET; needed to validate that this is a normal object (not, e.g., a macro expanding to control flow). \n- sin6_addr (member of sa_in6): same rationale for AF_INET6 path. \n- AF_INET: switch case label constant; required to know whether this label can match the sa_family value (and to ensure it is a simple constant, not a macro with control-flow). \n- AF_INET6: same as AF_INET for the IPv6 case; relevant if OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined. \n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: preprocessor symbol controlling inclusion of the AF_INET6 case; needed to know which source is actually compiled and whether code is conditionally present or absent. \n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS: value returned in the default label; required to ensure it is an ordinary constant/expression (and not a macro that expands to control-flow statements), because if it expands to something with control-flow it could affect reachability analysis. \n- OS_ERROR: returned on inet_pton failure; included because if it were a macro with control-flow or non-standard expansion it could alter reachability reasoning around the subsequent return. \n- OS_SUCCESS: function return value on success; included to confirm it is a normal constant. \n- inet_pton (declaration/possible macro): the call's semantics (and whether inet_pton is a macro that could expand to control-flow, e.g., containing returns or goto) can affect which statements after it are reachable; include its declaration/definition to rule that out.\n\nIn particular, to determine whether the 'break;' after 'return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;' (in the default label) is unreachable (a direct MISRA C violation), the analyzer needs the above symbols to confirm: (a) which switch cases are actually compiled (OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6), (b) that the return expressions are ordinary values/macros without embedded control-flow, and (c) the structure/layout used to reach those labels. These symbols are the minimal set required to conclude whether any code in the function is genuinely unreachable under the project's actual definitions."
