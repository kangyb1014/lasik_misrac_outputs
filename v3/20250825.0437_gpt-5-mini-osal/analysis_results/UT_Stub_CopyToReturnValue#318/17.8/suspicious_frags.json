  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies any of the function parameters. Details:\n- FuncKey is passed by value to UT_GetStubEntry and is not assigned to anywhere in the function.\n- BufferPtr is only passed as the source argument to memcpy (read-only access); the pointer itself is not reassigned. The destination of memcpy is StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr, not BufferPtr. Reading or modifying the object pointed to is allowed under the rule; the pointer itself must not be modified and it isn't.\n- BufferSize is only read (used in a comparison and then stored into StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position); it is not assigned to or changed.\n- StubPtr and its fields are local objects and are assigned/modified, which does not violate the rule about function parameters.\nThus there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
