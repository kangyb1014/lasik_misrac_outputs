  "explanation": "I selected all conditional and loop controlling expressions from the provided code and related functions for review. These constructs are the only places where MISRA C Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) can apply. Other fragments in the code are declarations, assignments, function calls, comments or non-controlling expressions and therefore cannot violate Rule 14.3. For the selected fragments: many depend on volatile fields (sem->current_value, sem->flush_request), function call results, or input parameters, so they are likely variant at runtime; nonetheless they are listed so other reviewers can verify that none are compile-time invariant (constant) and that any uses that appear constant are covered by the rule exceptions (e.g., intentional infinite waits). No other control expressions exist in the supplied code that could be relevant to Rule 14.3."
