  "explanation": "The fragments above are the code areas where control flow and synchronization interact (object table lookup, mutex acquire/cleanup region, the wait loop and its timed-wait branch, and the flush/give updates that interact with the wait loop). These are the places where unreachable code is most likely to occur (e.g. due to logic that makes branches never taken, cancellation/cleanup interaction that may cause handlers to run or not run, or a condition that cannot be true because of preceding assignments). Other parts of the function and the supplied related functions were not selected because they are simple, directly reachable statements or definitions whose execution depends on runtime results (e.g. macro expansion, simple returns, constant definitions). There are no compile-time constant conditions or obviously dead statements elsewhere in the provided code that would make those other lines statically unreachable; their reachability depends on runtime values (mutex acquisition result, condition-variable return values, flush counter changes), so they do not warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1 beyond the synchronization/loop/cleanup fragments already reported."
