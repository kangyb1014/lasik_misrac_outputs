  "explanation": "I have reported all application-level call sites present in the provided code that could participate in a direct or indirect recursive cycle and therefore need investigation: calls from main to OS_BSP_Initialize, OS_Application_Startup, OS_Application_Run and OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus, plus the calls inside OS_Application_Startup and OS_Application_Run (OS_API_Init, OS_ApplicationExit, OS_IdleLoop). These are the only places where one project function calls another project function (or returns a project-managed status) and thus where indirect recursion could occur.\n\nOther code fragments were not flagged because they do not create potential recursion paths: library calls and system interfaces in OS_BSP_Initialize (geteuid, fopen, fgets, strtoul, fclose, pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init, strerror) are standard/runtime functions that do not call back into the application functions shown here; simple assignments, memset calls, and the BSP_DEBUG macro (defined empty) do not form recursion; OS_BSP_Initialize\u2019s internal code does not call OS_BSP_Initialize (no direct recursion). Therefore they need not be investigated for Rule 17.2."
