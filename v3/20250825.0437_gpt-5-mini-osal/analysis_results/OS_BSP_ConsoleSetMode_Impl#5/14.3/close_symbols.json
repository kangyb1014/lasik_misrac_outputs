A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must determine whether any of the controlling expressions in OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl are compile\u2011time invariant. For that you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - The first if uses OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.EnableTermControl as the controlling expression. To decide if that test is invariant you need the declaration/definition of OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal and the type/initializer of its EnableTermControl member (is it a #define, const, enum constant, or a mutable/volatile runtime variable?). If EnableTermControl is a compile\u2011time constant or macro this would make the controlling expression invariant.\n\n- OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL\n  - Used in the comparison (ModeBits == OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL). Knowing whether this symbol is a compile\u2011time constant, macro, or something else confirms that the RHS is constant \u2014 but ModeBits is a parameter, so the expression is not invariant unless ModeBits itself were also a constant; still include to confirm its nature.\n\n- OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT\n  - Used in the bitmask test ((ModeBits & OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT) == 0). You need its definition to determine whether it is a compile\u2011time constant or an expression that could make the entire controlling expression invariant. Again, ModeBits is variable, but if this macro were e.g. 0 or some expression that together with ModeBits could be simplified to a constant in some contexts, you must check the definition.\n\n- OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR\n  - Although not part of a controlling expression, this macro/function is referenced nearby and could be a macro that affects evaluation or visibility of constants; include its definition to rule out any surprising macro expansions or compile\u2011time constant interactions that could affect control expressions.\n\n- ModeBits (parameter type/typedef uint32)\n  - Confirm the exact type of ModeBits (the uint32 typedef) and whether it could be defined as a macro, const, or otherwise transformed so the comparisons/bitwise operations become constant. Also check for attributes (e.g. compiler attributes, const/volatile) that might affect whether the expression is considered invariant.\n\nNote: OS_BSP_ExecTput and snprintf are not needed to decide whether the controlling expressions are invariant (they are callees/side\u2011effecting functions), so they are not included. The goal is to establish if any controlling expression can be evaluated at compile time to a constant; the listed symbols provide the necessary definitions to make that determination."
