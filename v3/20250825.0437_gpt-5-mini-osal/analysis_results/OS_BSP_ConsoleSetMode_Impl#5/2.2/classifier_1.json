Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl(uint32 ModeBits)\n{\n    char param[32];\n\n    if (OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.EnableTermControl)\n    {\n        if (ModeBits == OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"sgr0\", NULL);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ((ModeBits & OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT) == 0)\n            {\n                /* no highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"rmso\", NULL);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                /* set highlight (standout) text */\n                OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"smso\", NULL);\n            }\n\n            snprintf(param, sizeof(param), \"%d\", OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(ModeBits));\n            OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl:\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_NORMAL 0x0\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_HIGHLIGHT 0x8\n...\n#define OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(x) ((x)&0x07)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsnprintf(param, sizeof(param), \"%d\", OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(ModeBits));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The snprintf call formats the ANSI color (OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR(ModeBits)) into param which is immediately used by OS_BSP_ExecTput(\"setaf\", param). Removing the snprintf (and the subsequent setaf call) would change program behaviour (no color parameter would be passed). While the macro masks to the low 3 bits and could evaluate to zero for some ModeBits values, that does not prove the operation is dead: there is no evidence here that the setaf call (or formatting it) has no observable effect in all configurations. Only if it were provably impossible for the formatted value or the subsequent setaf call to affect behavior (e.g. setaf is a no-op and ModeBits low bits are always zero) would this be dead code, which is not established by the provided code."
