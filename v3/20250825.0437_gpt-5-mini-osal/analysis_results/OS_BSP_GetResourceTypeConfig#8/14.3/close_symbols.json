  "explanation": "OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: The controlling expression is (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER). To decide if that expression can be invariant you must know the definition and numeric value (macro/enum) of OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (e.g. if it is 0 the comparison with an unsigned type is always false).\n\nuint32: The signedness and width of uint32 (typedef) matter for determining invariance semantics (e.g. unsigned vs signed comparison behavior, wrap/underflow considerations). Confirming uint32 is an unsigned 32-bit type (typically uint32_t) is required.\n\nOS_BSP_Global: The function reads OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig in the true branch. While the MISRA rule focuses on the controlling expression, knowledge of the global object type/definition can show whether the code relies on constant/compile-time state or side-effects that could make the condition effectively invariant in the system context.\n\nOS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig: The array/member accessed when the condition is true; its declaration (size, volatile/const qualifiers) can influence analysis about whether program state can vary across calls and thus whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant in the operational environment."
