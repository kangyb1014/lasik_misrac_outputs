  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig:\n```c\nuint32 OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig(uint32 ResourceType)\n{\n    uint32 ConfigOptionValue;\n\n    if (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER)\n    {\n        ConfigOptionValue = OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ConfigOptionValue = 0;\n    }\n\n    return ConfigOptionValue;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nConfigOptionValue = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment 'ConfigOptionValue = 0;' is required to define the return value when ResourceType >= OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER. Removing it would change the function behaviour for that case, so it is not dead code. (If the else branch were provably unreachable, it would be unreachable code \u2014 which per Note 2 is not classified as dead code.)"
