  "explanation": "No usage of the string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in this function, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which specifically targets those functions) has no direct applicability here. The only memory access of note is the array index OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType]; this is not a string.h function call. Whether that array access is bounds-safe depends on the definitions/size of ResoureConfig and the value of OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (i.e. whether the check ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER correctly constrains the index), but that is a different concern (array bounds checking / indexing rules) and not a violation of Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation specifically for Rule 21.17."
