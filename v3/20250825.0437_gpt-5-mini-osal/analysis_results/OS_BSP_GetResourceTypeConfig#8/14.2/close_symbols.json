Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For determining whether this function can violate the MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule you must be able to prove there are no for-loops (or side-effecting constructs that introduce for-loops) reachable from the function. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER\n  - This identifier is used in the conditional (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER). If it is an ordinary integer constant/enum this is safe to treat as a simple value. However if it is a macro that expands to an expression or to code that contains a for-loop or side effects, that could introduce a for-loop or persistent side effects into the evaluated expression. Inspecting its definition rules out that possibility.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global\n  - The function reads OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig. If OS_BSP_Global is a macro (or an accessor macro) rather than a plain global object, its expansion might contain function calls or loops. You must inspect its declaration/definition to ensure the member access is a simple object access and not a macro that hides control flow.\n\n- type of OS_BSP_Global (the struct/union tag)\n  - The full definition of the global\u2019s type is needed to understand what ResoureConfig is (array, pointer, bitfield, function-like macro, etc.). If the member is implemented via an inline function or other accessor in the type definition, that could contain loops.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (declaration/definition)\n  - Crucial to know whether ResoureConfig is an array, pointer to array, a macro name, or something implemented via a getter function/macro. If it is a simple object (array) indexing has no hidden for-loops; if it\u2019s a macro or function call, its body could contain for-loops (or other side effects) which would need to be analyzed against the MISRA rule.\n\n- element type of ResoureConfig (type of ResoureConfig[i])\n  - If indexing triggers any custom operator (unlikely in C) or if element access requires a function-like accessor, you need the element type and related access functions to rule out embedded loops or side effects in element retrieval.\n\n- ResoureConfig accessor macro or function (if ResoureConfig is implemented via macro/function)\n  - If ResoureConfig is not a plain object, you must inspect the accessor implementation. Any function or macro used to produce the value may contain a for-loop (or call functions that do), and the MISRA rule applies to loops within functions called from the for-loop body or the evaluated expressions.\n\n- uint32 (typedef)\n  - To confirm ResourceType is an unsigned integer type with no hidden semantics. This is needed to ensure comparisons and indexing are ordinary expressions and cannot expand into constructs that include for-loops.\n\nNote: There are no explicit for-loops in the function text. The only way this function could violate the MISRA for-loop rule is if one of the above symbols hides code (via macro expansion or an accessor function) that contains a for-loop or otherwise introduces side effects relevant to the rule. Therefore examine the listed symbols (and the headers/macros that define them) to conclude compliance."
