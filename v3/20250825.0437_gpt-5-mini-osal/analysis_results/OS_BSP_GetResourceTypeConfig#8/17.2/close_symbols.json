  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig can (directly or indirectly) call itself you must know any symbols that could introduce calls or change the expression semantics and you must inspect the program call graph. Specifically:\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: needed to understand the branch condition; while not directly related to recursion, it rules out path-dependent behavior if this macro expands to something unexpected (e.g. a function-like macro) and ensures the condition does not hide a call.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: the global identifier might be a macro or an object; its definition is required to know whether reading it involves function calls (macro expansion or accessor functions) or is a plain object.\n\n- type of OS_BSP_Global (the struct/typedef that declares ResoureConfig): required to see the exact type of the ResoureConfig member (array, pointer, function pointer array, accessor macro, etc.). If ResoureConfig is a function pointer or its access expands to a function call, that could create a call edge.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (declaration/type of the ResoureConfig member): directly required to determine whether the expression OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType] is a simple integer read (no call) or an invocation (for example an array of function pointers or a macro that invokes a function).\n\n- any macro definitions that expand OS_BSP_Global or ResoureConfig: macros can hide function calls; you must inspect the macro expansions to ensure no hidden calls are introduced by the syntax used in the function.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32: included to fully understand types involved (rarely affects recursion), but useful for completeness and to confirm no function-like conversion or inline accessor is used.\n\n- All functions that call OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig (direct callers) from the static call graph: to detect indirect recursion you must examine callers of this function to see whether there exists a path back to it.\n\n- All callers-of-callers (transitive callers) of OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig from the static call graph: recursion can be indirect through multiple levels; the transitive caller set is required to detect any cycle that includes OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig.\n\nProvide the above declarations/definitions and the static call-graph (or the list of callers/transitive callers) to the next agent so it can determine whether any call edges form a cycle involving OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig."
