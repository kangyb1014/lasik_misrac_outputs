  "explanation": "1) OS_BSP_Global: The actual variable (and its linkage) must be inspected to see whether it or its members are declared with const. The MISRA rule concerns whether pointers (or arrays that decay to pointers) are const-qualified, so we must examine the concrete declaration of this global instance. \n\n2) type/struct definition that declares OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig: The struct/typedef that contains the ResoureConfig member is required to determine the exact type of ResoureConfig (e.g. whether it is declared as an array, a pointer, or some typedef), and to see any const qualification at the member level.\n\n3) declaration of the ResoureConfig member (its complete type: array vs pointer, element type, any const qualifiers): This is the key symbol for the MISRA check. If ResoureConfig is a pointer (or an array) we need to know the pointed-to type and whether that type is const-qualified (e.g. uint32 const * or const uint32[]). Only with the precise member declaration can you decide if the pointer should be/needs to be const-qualified per MISRA.\n\n4) typedef/definition of uint32: The element type used for indexing (and any typedefs used inside ResoureConfig) must be known to see if the pointed-to type already carries const qualification via the typedef or if the typedef hides constness.\n\n5) OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: Although not directly about pointer constness, its definition is needed to understand the indexing condition (bounds/usage) and whether ResoureConfig is indexed with a value that could require different constness/visibility considerations. Also the type of the macro (integer width) confirms compatibility with ResourceType/indexing type."
