  "explanation": "The provided function itself has no pointer parameters, local pointer variables, or pointer casts; the only expressions that could involve pointers are the external global OS_BSP_Global and the member access to ResoureConfig. ResoureConfig may be declared elsewhere as a pointer type (for example uint32 *ResoureConfig) and OS_BSP_Global is a non-const external object, so these should be investigated to determine whether any pointer should point to a const-qualified type. No other fragments in the supplied code contain pointer usage or pointer-like constructs that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
