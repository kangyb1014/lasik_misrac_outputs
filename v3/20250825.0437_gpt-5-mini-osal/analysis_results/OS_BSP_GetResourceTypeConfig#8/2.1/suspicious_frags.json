  "suspicious_frags": [

  ],
  "explanation": "Other parts of the function are simple, reachable constructs and do not on their own present obvious unreachable-code concerns: the function header and return statement are required and executed; the local variable declaration (uint32 ConfigOptionValue;) is necessary storage and not unreachable; the macro definition (#define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER 0x10) is a compile-time constant and does not itself constitute unreachable code. The suspected fragments listed above cover the conditional and each branch assignment that could be unreachable depending on how ResourceType is constrained elsewhere (preconditions, caller behavior, or additional invariants), so they are the relevant places to investigate for possible unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
