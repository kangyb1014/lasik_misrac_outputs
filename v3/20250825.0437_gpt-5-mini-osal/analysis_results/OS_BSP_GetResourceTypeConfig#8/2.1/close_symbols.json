  "explanation": "1) OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER \u2014 The if/else decision is driven solely by comparing ResourceType to this symbol. Its compile-time value (or whether it is a macro/enum constant) determines whether the 'if' or the 'else' branch can ever be taken; e.g. if it is 0 the if-branch is impossible, if it is a large constant the else-branch may be impossible. To prove reachability you must know this value.\n\n2) uint32 (typedef) \u2014 The signedness and range of the ResourceType parameter affect the comparison semantics (unsigned wrap/underflow considerations). Knowing the exact typedef (e.g. unsigned int, uint32_t) is needed to conclude whether any value can satisfy ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER.\n\n3) OS_BSP_Global (variable) \u2014 The global object that is read in the if-branch. You need its definition to know whether the member access might have side effects (e.g. volatile), or other attributes that affect whether the read could be required even if the branch is unlikely.\n\n4) OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (field: element type, qualifier, and array length) \u2014 The type, qualifiers (volatile/const), and declared length of the ResoureConfig array are required to determine if indexing it is well-defined or has side effects. If ResoureConfig is volatile (hardware/register-mapped), the read cannot be optimized away and the branch may be considered necessary even if conditional bounds make it otherwise unlikely. The array length is also needed to reason about index validity (though that impacts correctness/UB, it bears on whether the branch is meaningful)."
