  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig contains no calls to memcmp, no inclusion of string-handling functions, and no operations on char pointers or null-terminated strings. All operations are on uint32 values and an array access (OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType]). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate Rule 21.14, and no fragments need further investigation for this specific rule."
