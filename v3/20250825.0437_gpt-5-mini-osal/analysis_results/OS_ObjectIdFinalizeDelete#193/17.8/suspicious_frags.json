  "explanation": "No code fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically:\n\n- In OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, the scalar parameter operation_status is only read (compared) and returned; it is never assigned to. The pointer parameter token is not reassigned anywhere in the function (no statements like token = ...).\n\n- The local variable final_id is a non-parameter local object that is assigned and its address is passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish as a const osal_id_t*. Passing the address of a local to a const pointer parameter is allowed here because the callee only reads (*final_id) and does not modify the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish modifies the contents of the object pointed to by token (e.g. token->lock_mode, record->active_id). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule; the rule only forbids modifying the pointer itself. In OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish there is no reassignment of the token parameter (no token = ...), so the pointer itself is not modified.\n\n- OS_NotifyEvent is called with token->obj_id and NULL; it does not alter the pointer parameters of the caller.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
