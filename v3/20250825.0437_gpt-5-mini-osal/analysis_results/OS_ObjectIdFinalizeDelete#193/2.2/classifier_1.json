Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete:\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    osal_id_t final_id;\n\n    /* Clear the OSAL ID if successful - this returns the record to the pool */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        final_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* this restores the original ID */\n        final_id = token->obj_id;\n    }\n\n    /* Either way we must unlock the object type */\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id);\n\n    /* Give event callback to the application */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_RESOURCE_DELETED, token->obj_id, NULL);\n    }\n\n    return operation_status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete:\nvoid OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(OS_object_token_t *token, const osal_id_t *final_id)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        /* nothing to do */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    record = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n\n    /* re-acquire global table lock to adjust refcount */\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE || token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT)\n    {\n        OS_Lock_Global(token);\n    }\n\n    if (record->refcount > 0)\n    {\n        --record->refcount;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * at this point the global mutex is always held, either\n     * from re-acquiring it above or it is still held from\n     * the original lock when using OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL.\n     *\n     * If an ID update was pending (i.e. for a create/delete op)\n     * then do the ID update now while holding the mutex.\n     */\n    if (final_id != NULL)\n    {\n        record->active_id = *final_id;\n    }\n    else if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE)\n    {\n        /*\n         * If the lock type was EXCLUSIVE, it means that the ID in the record\n         * was reset to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The 'else if' branch is reached when OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish is called with final_id == NULL and token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE (it restores the original ID from the token). Although OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete always passes a non-NULL final_id, other call sites or intended semantics allow calling OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish with final_id == NULL, so this code is potentially executed and is not dead. Even if a particular analysis showed no current callers that trigger it, unreachable code is not the same as dead code per MISRA note 2, so there is no proven violation of Rule 2.2."
