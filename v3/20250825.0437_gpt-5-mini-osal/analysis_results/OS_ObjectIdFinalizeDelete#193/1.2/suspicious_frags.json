  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function body uses only standard C constructs (if/else, assignment, function calls, pointer dereference). The only potentially noteworthy token is the macro definition shown in the additional code: #define OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED ((osal_id_t){0}) \u2014 this uses a compound literal, which is part of standard C99 (not a compiler extension). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __declspec, typeof (GCC), statement expressions ({ ... } GNU extension returning value), inline assembly, pragma GCC/Clang/MSVC diagnostics, or other vendor-specific builtins. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as stated (which asks to report only explicit compiler extensions). Note: if the project enforces only pre-C99 (C89) language subset, the compound literal would be unsupported by that older standard \u2014 but that is a missing language feature, not a compiler-specific extension; per the rule given, it is not an explicit compiler extension to report here."
