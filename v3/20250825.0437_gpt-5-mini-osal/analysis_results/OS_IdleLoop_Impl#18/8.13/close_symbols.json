  "explanation": "To check MISRA C rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" for the call sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask) you must know: \n\n- sigsuspend (prototype/declaration): The formal parameter type (e.g., int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask)) determines whether the function expects a pointer-to-const. If the parameter is already a const-qualified pointer, passing the address of a non-const object is allowed; if it is non-const, passing a pointer-to-non-const might indicate the API requires a mutable object. The prototype is required to decide whether the pointer expression here should be const.\n\n- sigset_t (typedef/definition): The exact type of NormalSigMask (sigset_t or another) and any const qualification on that typedef affect whether the pointer type should be const. You need the typedef to reason about the pointed-to type and its qualifiers.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (definition/declaration): The global object declaration shows whether NormalSigMask is declared const (e.g., const sigset_t NormalSigMask) or non-const and whether the object has external linkage. That determines whether &NormalSigMask yields a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const and whether changing it to const is feasible.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member declaration): The member's declaration (type and qualifiers) is the immediate subject of analysis \u2014 you must know its precise type and qualifiers to decide if the pointer expression violates MISRA or could/should be declared const.\n\n- All definitions/usages that assign to or modify POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (e.g., the task-init code referenced in the comment): MISRA's guidance \"whenever possible\" requires checking whether NormalSigMask is actually modified anywhere. If it is assigned or modified after initialization, it cannot be const. Locating assignments/writes (initialization or later modifications) is necessary to decide whether the object can be const-qualified without breaking behavior.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the function prototype, the sigset type, the global/member declaration, and all write sites) provides the complete information needed to conclude whether the pointer expression should point to a const-qualified type under MISRA C."
