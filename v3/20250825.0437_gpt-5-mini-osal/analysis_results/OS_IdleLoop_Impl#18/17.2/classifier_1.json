  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: OS_IdleLoop calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl inside a loop, but OS_IdleLoop_Impl does not call OS_IdleLoop (it only calls sigsuspend). There is no direct or indirect call path from OS_IdleLoop_Impl back to OS_IdleLoop in the provided code, so Rule 17.2 is not violated."
