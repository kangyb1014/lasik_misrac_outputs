  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a global variable definition/initialization (POSIX_GlobalVars_t POSIX_GlobalVars = {0};). This is not a function call and does not introduce any direct or indirect function recursion. The shown functions (OS_IdleLoop -> OS_IdleLoop_Impl -> sigsuspend) do not call themselves; OS_IdleLoop_Impl calls sigsuspend and OS_IdleLoop repeatedly calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl in a loop, but there is no self-call chain. Therefore no Rule 17.2 violation."
