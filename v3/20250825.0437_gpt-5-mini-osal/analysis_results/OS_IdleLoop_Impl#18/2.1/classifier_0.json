  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: The while-loop body is reachable because it depends on the run-time value of OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState and calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl(), which will execute when GlobalState != OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER. OS_IdleLoop_Impl uses sigsuspend to wait for signals and returns on signal delivery, allowing the loop and its body to be executed or to exit when GlobalState becomes OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER. (Only in a hypothetical situation where GlobalState were a compile-time constant equal to OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER and never changed at run time would the loop body be provably unreachable.)"
