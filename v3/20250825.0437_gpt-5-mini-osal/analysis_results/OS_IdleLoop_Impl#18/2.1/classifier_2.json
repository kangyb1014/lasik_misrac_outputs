  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. OS_Application_Run simply calls OS_IdleLoop(), which contains a loop that may be effectively infinite in normal operation but can exit when OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState equals OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER (and OS_IdleLoop_Impl can be interrupted by signals). There is no code in the project that is provably never reachable (no statements following an inescapable construct in the shown fragments), so Rule 2.1 is not violated by the provided fragment."
