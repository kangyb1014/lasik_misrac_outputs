  "explanation": "- POSIX_GlobalVars / POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: The target calls sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask). You need the definition/initialization and type of POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask to confirm the argument is a valid object and to understand any initialization/compile-time conditions that could make the call (or the whole function) unreachable.  \n- sigsuspend (declaration/semantics): The runtime semantics and any attributes (e.g. noreturn) of sigsuspend determine whether control can return from the call. To decide if code after sigsuspend would be unreachable (or whether the function itself has reachable behavior), the prototype and documented behavior are required.  \n- OS_IdleLoop: This is the direct caller of OS_IdleLoop_Impl. You must inspect OS_IdleLoop's implementation to see when/if it invokes OS_IdleLoop_Impl (unconditionally or only on certain configuration paths) to determine reachability.  \n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: OS_IdleLoop also calls UT_ExecuteBasicHandler; its presence in OS_IdleLoop may indicate conditional control flow that affects whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl is ever reached. Inspecting this symbol clarifies alternative paths and possible unreachable code.  \n- OS_Application_Run: This is the caller of OS_IdleLoop. To decide whether the idle loop sequence (and thus OS_IdleLoop_Impl) is reachable from program entry, the call chain up to OS_Application_Run and any conditions there must be known.  \nCollectively these symbols let the analyst determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl can be invoked at runtime or whether it (or code following its calls) is unreachable, which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule on unreachable code."
