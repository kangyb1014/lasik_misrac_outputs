  "explanation": "No other code fragments in the provided snippets need investigation for Rule 2.2. The only executable operation in OS_IdleLoop_Impl is the sigsuspend call (and the surrounding function definition) \u2014 everything else present is a comment. The separate global definition shown (POSIX_GlobalVars_t POSIX_GlobalVars = {0}) is an initialization; per MISRA note 3, initialization is not considered a candidate for dead code, so it should not be flagged. There are no other statements or unreachable blocks in the provided code that would merit further inspection under Rule 2.2."
