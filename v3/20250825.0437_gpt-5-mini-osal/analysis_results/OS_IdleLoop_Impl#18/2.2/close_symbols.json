  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl is dead code (i.e., its removal would not affect program behaviour) we must know all symbols that affect whether the call to sigsuspend actually changes program behaviour and whether the function is reachable and used in timing semantics. For each symbol:\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: the global container referenced in the function; needed to find the definition and life-time of NormalSigMask and confirm it is not an unused/optimized-away object.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: the exact sigset_t used by sigsuspend. The contents (which signals are masked/unmasked) determine whether sigsuspend will block until an event relevant to program behaviour occurs. If NormalSigMask is empty or equivalent to current mask, the call may be a no-op.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars initialization code (where NormalSigMask is computed/set): to see how NormalSigMask is computed (which signals were added/removed) and when that computation happens. This affects whether the idle wait is meaningful and whether removing the call changes signal/timer delivery/timing.\n\n- sigsuspend (or any project wrapper): to confirm the actual semantics used (project may wrap or stub the libc call). If sigsuspend is a no-op in this build or replaced, the call could be dead.\n\n- sigwait (or the timebase thread function that calls sigwait): comment in the function references a dedicated thread doing sigwait for RT signals. Inspecting that thread shows whether timers/timebase depend on the idle loop masking/waiting behaviour; interaction between sigsuspend and sigwait determines whether signals are delivered and thus whether removing the idle wait affects behaviour.\n\n- sigprocmask / pthread_sigmask (functions that change thread signal masks): to see where and when the process/thread mask is changed relative to NormalSigMask. The idle loop relies on having a particular mask; if the mask management makes sigsuspend redundant, the call may be removable.\n\n- timer/timebase creation APIs (timer_create, timer_settime or project wrappers): timers typically deliver RT signals. You must confirm timers exist and use the signals masked/unmasked by NormalSigMask; otherwise the idle wait may be irrelevant.\n\n- OS_IdleLoop (caller): to confirm how OS_IdleLoop_Impl is invoked (frequency, conditions) and whether an alternative path exists that produces identical behaviour if OS_IdleLoop_Impl is removed.\n\n- OS_Application_Run (caller of OS_IdleLoop): to understand higher-level usage and whether the idle loop participates in crucial scheduling/timing semantics; removal could change system timing even if it appears unused locally.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler (the other callee from OS_IdleLoop): to see whether OS_IdleLoop sometimes executes alternate logic instead of the idle wait and whether that alternate path already provides equivalent behaviour (which could indicate the idle wait is redundant).\n\nCollecting and analyzing these symbols (definitions, call sites, initializations and any project-specific wrappers) allows the next analyst to decide whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl performs observable actions whose removal would change program behaviour (thus not dead code) or whether it can be safely removed without effect."
