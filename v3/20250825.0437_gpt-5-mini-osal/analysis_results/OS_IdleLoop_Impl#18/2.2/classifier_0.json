  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_IdleLoop_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)\n{\n    /*\n     * Unblock signals and wait for something to occur\n     *\n     * Note - \"NormalSigMask\" was calculated during task init to be the original signal mask\n     * of the process PLUS all \"RT\" signals.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: OS_IdleLoop_Impl invokes sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask), which suspends the thread and affects program timing and behaviour. Removing that call would change runtime behaviour (the idle loop would no longer block/wait for signals), so the operation is not dead. The global POSIX_GlobalVars being zero-initialized does not imply the call is redundant (the mask may be set later and, in any case, sigsuspend changes scheduling/timing), and unreachable-code considerations do not apply here."
