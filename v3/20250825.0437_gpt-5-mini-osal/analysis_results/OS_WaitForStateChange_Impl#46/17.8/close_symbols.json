  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for modification of function parameters:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The code indexes this table with the parameter 'idtype'. Need its declaration to confirm it is a plain array (or const/volatile) and that the indexing expression cannot expand via macro to modify 'idtype'.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The local pointer 'impl' is assigned from the table. Need the struct definition to confirm fields used (mutex, cond) are ordinary members and not macros or aliases that could reference or modify the function parameters.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The type of parameter 'idtype'. Its definition is required to ensure it is a simple integral/enum type (not a macro or complex type whose access might imply modification) and to confirm indexing semantics.\n\n- uint32: The type of parameter 'attempts'. Required to confirm it is a plain integer typedef and not a macro or type that would allow implicit modification semantics.\n\n- struct timespec: 'ts' is a local variable whose fields are modified. Need the definition to confirm tv_nsec/tv_sec are fields of this local object (thus allowed modifications) and not aliases to parameters.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop: These are macros (or library wrappers) that expand into code at the call site. Their expansions must be inspected to ensure they do not perform assignments to the function parameters (idtype or attempts) or otherwise modify them.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: Passed as the cleanup handler to pthread_cleanup_push. Need its declaration/definition in case it is a macro or inline that could capture and modify function parameters by name (rare but possible in macro-based code).\n\n- clock_gettime: Prototype/implementation may be a macro wrapper. Confirming its form ensures it does not expand into code that touches function parameters.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: Prototype/macro definition should be checked to ensure no macro expansion at the call site modifies the function parameters.\n\n- false: The symbol passed to pthread_cleanup_pop. Ensure it is the expected literal/macro (0) and not a macro that could expand to code referencing/modifying parameters.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule under check forbids modifying formal parameters. The source does not explicitly assign to 'idtype' or 'attempts', but macros and external symbols used at the call site (pthread_cleanup_push/pop, the cleanup handler, table access) could expand or be defined in ways that modify them. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to inspect such definitions/expansions and to confirm that modifications are only to local objects (ts, *impl) and not to the formal parameters."
