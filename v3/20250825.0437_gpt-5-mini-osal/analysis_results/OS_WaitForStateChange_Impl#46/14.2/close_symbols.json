The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Provide the definitions/semantics of every external symbol used by OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl so a reviewer can determine whether any for-loop constraints could be violated via side-effects, called functions, or modified objects.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: global array used to obtain 'impl'. Need its declaration/type (indexing range, constness) to see whether access has side effects or aliases objects that might be used as loop counters elsewhere.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: definition of the struct type so the analyzer knows which members exist and their types (particularly 'mutex' and 'cond') and whether accessing impl->... could alias or modify objects used in a for loop.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: the cleanup handler pushed by pthread_cleanup_push. Its implementation is required to know whether it modifies any objects that could be used as loop counters or loop control flags (the rule considers behaviour of called functions part of loop behaviour).\n\n- clock_gettime: the called library function that writes to struct timespec. Its signature/semantics are required to know which objects get modified (here 'ts') and whether it has persistent side effects beyond local variables.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: the function called while holding the mutex; its behaviour (including potential modification of mutex/cond or other shared objects, or cancellation behaviour) must be known because called functions are considered part of loop behaviour and may introduce persistent side effects.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop: their macro semantics determine when the cleanup handler is invoked and whether it can run inside a loop context or on cancellation; needed to reason about side effects and whether objects might be modified implicitly.\n\n- struct timespec: the layout and member types (tv_sec, tv_nsec) are necessary to see which fields are modified and whether those modifications could interact with loop counters or loop-control expressions.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: the clock identifier passed to clock_gettime; included for completeness to understand whether clock_gettime might have non-local side effects in this environment.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: the typedef/enum of the idtype parameter (range and underlying type) is needed to reason about indexing into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table and whether that could alias or modify objects used as loop counters.\n\n- uint32: underlying width and signedness of 'attempts' is required to check arithmetic and comparisons (e.g., attempts*attempts*10000000) for overflow/side-effect concerns that could impact loop-counter semantics if similar code is moved into a for loop.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t: the types of impl->mutex and impl->cond; their semantics (e.g., whether operations on them may modify other objects) are relevant because mutex/cond operations inside a for loop body (or called functions) count as part of loop behaviour and must not modify loop counters or forbidden objects.\n\nThese symbols give the next analyst the type definitions and function behaviours necessary to determine whether any for-loop in or interacting with this function would violate the MISRA rule (notably by introducing persistent side effects in the second clause, modifying loop counters from called functions, or using objects modified in the loop body)."
