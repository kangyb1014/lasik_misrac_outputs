  "explanation": "To check MISRA's \"function parameter should not be modified\" rule we must know the exact types and qualifiers of the parameters and any macros/types used by the function:\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The token parameter is declared as \"const OS_object_token_t *token\". The exact typedef of OS_object_token_t is needed to determine what the const applies to (e.g. if OS_object_token_t itself is a pointer typedef, the effective const qualification and whether modifications to the pointee/pointer could occur differs). This affects whether modifying the parameter or the object it points to would violate the rule.\n\n- OS_module_prop_t: The module_prop parameter is a pointer to this type. Its definition is needed to determine whether it contains const members, whether it is an alias to another pointer type, or whether any implicit conversions/assignments could be performed that would appear as modifications to the parameter. Knowing the underlying type helps detect illegal assignments to the pointer variable or to its pointee.\n\n- int32: The function return type uses int32; the typedef/definition is needed to ensure there are no surprising macro expansions or qualifiers that change the function signature (which could affect parameter interpretation in some build configurations).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this macro/enum. Its definition is required only to fully resolve the function body during analysis (to ensure the function has no hidden side effects via a macro expansion) and to confirm the function body does not contain any operations that modify parameters."
