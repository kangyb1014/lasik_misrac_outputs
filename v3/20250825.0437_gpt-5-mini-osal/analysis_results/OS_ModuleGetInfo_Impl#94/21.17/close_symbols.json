  "explanation": "OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl contains no string.h calls itself, but to be certain it cannot indirectly invoke any string handling or out\u2011of\u2011bounds access you must inspect: 1) OS_SUCCESS \u2014 this macro/constant is returned directly. Its definition could be a macro or expression that expands to a function call or other code that uses string.h functions (or otherwise performs memory access). 2) OS_object_token_t \u2014 the token parameter's typedef/definition should be checked for any macro annotations, accessor macros, or side\u2011effecting constructs that could expand into string handling calls when the function is compiled (even though the parameter is unused here). 3) OS_module_prop_t \u2014 same reason as the token type: its typedef/definition (or associated macros) might expand to code with string.h usage in some build configurations. Inspecting these three symbols (and any headers they pull in) is sufficient to confirm there are no hidden string.h calls or potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses stemming from this function's implementation."
