  "explanation": "I found no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls). The call graph in the provided code is UT_ResetState -> UT_ClearStubEntry. UT_ClearStubEntry only calls free() and memset() and does not call UT_ResetState or any other function that could call UT_ResetState or UT_ClearStubEntry. There are no function-pointer invocations or callback invocations in these fragments that could introduce indirect recursion, and UT_ClearStubEntry is static (file-local) so there is no external recursion path shown. Therefore no code fragments appear to violate Rule 17.2."
