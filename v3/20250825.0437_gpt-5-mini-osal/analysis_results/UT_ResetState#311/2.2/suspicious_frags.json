  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were inspected and are not flagged as likely dead code: the local variable declarations (UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr; int32 i;) and the pointer increment (++StubPtr) are required for correct iteration and are exercised by the loop. The comparison \"StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey\" is part of the intended selection logic and cannot be assumed dead without call-site knowledge. The memset and the conditional free in UT_ClearStubEntry are potentially observable (free can change program behaviour), so the function body as a whole must be investigated (included above) rather than excluding individual statements. No unreachable-code constructs are evident in the provided snippet; unreachable code is explicitly excluded from MISRA Rule 2.2's definition of dead code. The selected fragments are those that warrant further investigation for possible dead operations: repeated/reset global UT_MaxStubSearchLen, clearing of a statically zero-initialized table, the loop that clears entries, and the clear/free logic (each could be no-op in some execution scenarios and thus may constitute dead code). Other parts of the function are normal control/loop mechanics or type declarations and are unlikely to be dead code on their own."
