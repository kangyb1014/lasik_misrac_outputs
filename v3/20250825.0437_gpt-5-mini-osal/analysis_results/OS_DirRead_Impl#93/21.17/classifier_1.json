  "scenario": "No violation in normal use: strncpy is called with n = sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1 which fits within the destination buffer, and the code explicitly sets the final byte to NUL, so no write beyond the destination occurs. The source (de->d_name) produced by readdir() is a NUL-terminated filename, so strncpy will stop at the NUL and will not read beyond the source object. A hypothetical violation scenario would be if de->d_name were not NUL-terminated or its underlying buffer were smaller than the requested n; in that case strncpy could read beyond the source bounds and would violate Rule 21.17."
