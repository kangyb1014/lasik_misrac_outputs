True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable 'de' is declared as 'struct dirent *de' and is assigned the result of readdir(impl->dp). The code only reads from *de (copies de->d_name) and does not modify it, so 'de' could be declared as 'const struct dirent *de'. Because the pointer is not const-qualified when it could be, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Changing the declaration to 'const struct dirent *de' would resolve the violation (assignment from 'struct dirent *' to 'const struct dirent *' is allowed).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. In this function 'de' is only used for reading (de->d_name) and never modified, so it can and should be declared as a pointer to const-qualified type (e.g. const struct dirent *de). Assigning the result of readdir (struct dirent *) to const struct dirent * is allowed, so making this change would satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (The only practical caveat is if later code needed to modify *de; in the shown snippet it does not.)"
