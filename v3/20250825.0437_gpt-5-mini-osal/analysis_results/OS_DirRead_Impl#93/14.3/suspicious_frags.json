  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The code contains only a single conditional (if (de == NULL)) whose value depends on the runtime result of readdir(impl->dp), so it is not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops, switch statements, or constant-condition constructs in the function body. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro is used only in an assignment (impl = ...), not as a loop or branching controller; its expansion invokes OS_ObjectIndexFromToken at runtime and does not produce a compile-time invariant controlling expression. Other statements (strncpy, explicit null termination, readdir call) are not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
