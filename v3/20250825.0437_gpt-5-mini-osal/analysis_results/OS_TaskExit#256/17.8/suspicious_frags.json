  "explanation": "Only the fragments above pass the address of a local object (token) as a function argument; those calls require inspection to ensure the called functions do not modify their pointer parameters (i.e. reassign the pointer parameter itself). Other lines in the function do not pass pointer parameters or modify function parameters: the assignment from OS_TaskGetId_Impl() to the local task_id is a simple value assignment, the declaration of local variables is not a parameter modification, the call to OS_TaskExit_Impl() has no parameters, and comments have no effect \u2014 therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 17.8."
