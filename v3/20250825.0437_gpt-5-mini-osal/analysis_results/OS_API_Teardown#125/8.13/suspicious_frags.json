  "explanation": "No pointer usage appears in the provided code fragment: the function signature has no pointer parameters (void), there are no pointer declarations, no use of the address-of operator (&), no dereferences (*), and no pointer-type literals passed to the called functions. The only function calls present are OS_DeleteAllObjects() and OS_ApplicationShutdown(true) \u2014 the latter passes a boolean literal, not a pointer. Therefore MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (about pointers pointing to const-qualified types) is not applicable to any code shown here. Any pointer-related concerns would have to be investigated in the implementations or prototypes of the called functions, which are not included in this snippet and thus are not part of this assessment."
