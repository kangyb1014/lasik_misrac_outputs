The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' for this function you must ensure no for-loop is present or introduced by macros/expressions used here and that any expressions have no hidden side-effects. Each symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table: The object passed to memset. Its definition (object vs macro, type, storage) is needed to ensure no macro expansion or side-effectful construct introduces a for loop or other side-effects.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global structure/variable must be inspected to confirm whether access to its fields (in particular TruncateQueueDepth) is a simple l-value or a macro/function-like expansion that could contain a for loop or side-effects.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth: The field's type and definition are required to ensure the assignment here is a plain assignment (no overloaded/hidden behavior) and does not invoke functions or loops as a side-effect.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The global structure/variable that provides MaxQueueDepth. Its definition is needed to verify that reading MaxQueueDepth is a simple read (not a macro or access that expands to code containing loops or side-effects).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The field's type and definition to ensure that using it in the assignment does not call functions or expand to constructs that include for loops or other side-effects.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: The compile-time define selects which branch is compiled. The define's presence/absence determines whether OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth or OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(0) is used; the macro/conditional content must be inspected for any for-loop introduction.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: The macro used in the else branch must be inspected for its expansion. If it expands to any code (rather than a simple cast/constant), it could introduce loops or side-effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop check.\n\n- memset (declaration / macro): Standard library functions/macros can be implemented in different ways; confirm whether memset is a plain function call (no source visible loops in this translation unit) or a macro that could expand to loops. This ensures no for-loops are being introduced here.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The return value symbol/type is included to fully understand the function's semantics (and to detect any odd macro that might expand to code). Even though not directly about for-loops, this rules out unexpected macro expansions in the return.\n\n- int32 (typedef): The function return type definition is required to check for any unusual typedef macros that might hide code (very unlikely but needed to exclude macros that expand to code with loops).\n\nNote: The function source contains no explicit for loops. The focus of the above symbols is to detect any for-loops or side-effecting code that could be introduced indirectly via macros, field accessors, or function-like macros used in this function."
