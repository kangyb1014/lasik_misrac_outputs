  "scenario": "No violation if OS_impl_queue_table is an actual array (sizeof yields the full buffer size). In that normal case memset(OS_impl_queue_table, 0, sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table)) does not access beyond the bounds. A violation scenario would be if OS_impl_queue_table is actually a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer and sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table) does not reflect the allocated buffer size (for example sizeof yields pointer size while the allocated buffer is smaller or larger than the intended size), leading to a call where the size argument is greater than the pointed-to object and thus causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes."
