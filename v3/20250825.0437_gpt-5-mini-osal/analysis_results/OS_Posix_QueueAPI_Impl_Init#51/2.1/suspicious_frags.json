  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Rationale:\n\n- There are no control-flow constructs that make any statement impossible to execute at run-time within a given compilation unit: no statements appear after an unconditional return, no infinite loops, and no conditional expressions that are constant-false/constant-true within the same translation unit.\n\n- The #ifdef / #else branches are preprocessor-time alternatives, not run-time unreachable code; either branch may be compiled depending on the build configuration, so neither branch is intrinsically unreachable across the project.\n\n- The call to memset and the subsequent assignments are normal reachable statements executed when the function runs; using sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table) or an array potentially sized to zero does not create unreachable code (memset with size 0 is a no-op but not unreachable code).\n\n- External symbol declarations and macros (OS_BSP_Global, POSIX_GlobalVars, OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C, OS_SUCCESS) do not introduce unreachable code in this function.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If additional translation-unit or build-system information (e.g., guaranteed macro definitions for all builds, or other files that force one branch in all project configurations) is provided, revisit whether certain preprocessor branches are effectively always excluded in the entire project; only then could a branch be considered unreachable across the project."
