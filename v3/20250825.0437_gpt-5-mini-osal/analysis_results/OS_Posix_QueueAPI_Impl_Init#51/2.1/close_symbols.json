  "explanation": "- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: This preprocessor symbol controls which branch of the #ifdef is compiled. Determining whether any code inside the #ifdef/#else is unreachable requires knowing whether this macro is defined for the build.\n- OS_BSP_Global and OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The permissive branch assigns POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth = OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth; to know if that assignment is present in the compiled unit (and thus reachable) we must know that OS_BSP_Global and its MaxQueueDepth field exist and are visible in this translation unit.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars and POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth: Both branches write to this field. Understanding whether the write instructions are compiled (and thus reachable) requires the symbol for the target variable/field.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: The non-permissive branch uses this macro to initialize the field. To know if that expression is valid/compiled and whether it could be optimized away (affecting reachability), the macro definition is needed.\n- OS_impl_queue_table: The memset at the top operates on this object. To determine whether the memset call is meaningful/compiled (and not optimized out as unreachable/useless), the symbol and its size/type are required.\n- memset: The standard library function call is an executed statement in the function; to reason about reachable statements and possible side-effects you need to know this symbol is available (or resolved away).\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this constant; to confirm the return statement is a normal exit (and not in some dead code path) the value/definition is useful.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst determine which lines are actually present in the compiled translation unit (via the config macro and related macros/objects) and therefore whether any portion of the source constitutes unreachable code under the project's build configuration."
