  "explanation": "To decide whether the function uses any compiler language extensions the analyzer must examine all referenced symbols and macro definitions that could hide non-standard constructs or extensions:\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table / its declaration/definition: The sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table) usage depends on the actual definition of this symbol. Its type or declaration might use non-standard extensions (e.g., zero-length arrays, compiler-specific attributes, or unusual storage-class specifiers).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars and POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth (member type/definition): Assignment to TruncateQueueDepth could rely on an underlying type or member declaration that uses compiler extensions (bit-field widths, packed/attribute annotations, non-standard integer types). The member's definition is required to check for such extensions.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global and OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth (member type/definition): The code reads MaxQueueDepth; its definition or type may use non-standard constructs (compiler-specific integer types, attributes, macros). The actual definition is needed to verify no extensions are used.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE (preprocessor macro): The conditional compilation depends on this macro. Its presence/definition may change the compiled code path; additionally, the macro could be defined in a way that uses compiler-specific preprocessor features, so its definition must be checked.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C (macro definition): This macro is invoked in the code and could expand to compiler-specific constructs (casts using compiler-specific types, use of extension operators, pragmas, or GCC/Clang builtins). The macro definition is required to ensure it doesn't employ language extensions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/constant): The return value is a symbolic constant; its definition should be inspected to ensure it does not rely on extension features (e.g., unusual integer literal suffixes or macros that expand to extension constructs).\n\n- memset (declaration / <string.h>): Although memset is standard, verifying its declaration confirms no project-specific replacement or wrapper macro uses compiler extensions. Also ensures there's no macro or inline wrapper that uses extensions.\n\n- int32 (typedef / underlying type): The function return type uses int32; the typedef may map to a compiler-specific built-in type or use an extension (e.g., __int32 or other non-standard integer types). The typedef definition is needed to verify compliance.\n\nChecking these symbols (their declarations/definitions and related macro expansions) lets an analyzer detect any hidden use of compiler-specific or non-standard language extensions in the compiled form of this function."
