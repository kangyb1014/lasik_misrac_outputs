  "explanation": "I found no usage of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler attributes or keywords (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec) are present.\n- No inline assembly or asm(...) constructs are used.\n- No GCC/Clang extensions such as statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __builtin_*, nested functions, or zero-length arrays appear.\n- The casts present (for example (void *)name) are standard C casts (not an extension); while casting away const may be a const-correctness issue, it is not a compiler language extension and therefore not relevant to MISRA C Rule 1.2.\n- Macro usage and forward struct declarations are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n\nGiven the target of Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions) there are no code fragments in the supplied code that warrant investigation for use of compiler-specific language extensions."
