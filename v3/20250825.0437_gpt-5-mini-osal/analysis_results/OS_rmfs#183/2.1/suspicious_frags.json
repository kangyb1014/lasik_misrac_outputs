  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation because they contain standard, clearly reachable control flow or depend on functions/macros whose behavior (success vs failure) is not statically determined from the provided snippets: \n\n- The name-lookup branch in OS_rmfs that sets OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND is reachable when the lookup fails; the lookup function forwards to a search routine whose return value can be success or failure at runtime.\n- The OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch function contains both success and failure branches (ConvertToken vs TransactionCancel). Those branches are valid and reachable depending on the result of OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch, whose implementation is not shown, so the branches cannot be declared unreachable.\n- The forwarding wrapper OS_ObjectIdGetByName and the parameter check macro invocations are simple/standard and do not contain evidently unreachable code.\n\nThe fragments I selected are those that, based on the provided implementations, create a situation where other branches may never be exercised (and thus warrant investigation). Other code was not flagged because there is no evidence in the supplied code that those branches cannot be reached at runtime."
