  "explanation": "I inspected the provided OS_rmfs function and all additional code fragments included. Rule 21.14 concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the supplied source. String-handling occurrences present are:\n\n- OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(devname) (macro expansion not provided here; the call site does not itself use memcmp).\n- Passing the name pointer through OS_ObjectIdGetByName -> OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch (these functions forward the name to a match callback, but the implementation of the match callback, e.g. OS_ObjectNameMatch, is not included in the provided code).\n- OS_printf uses vsnprintf for formatting, not memcmp.\n\nBecause no memcmp usage appears in the provided code fragments, there are no in-scope code fragments that violate Rule 21.14 to report. Note: if the implementation of OS_ObjectNameMatch or the macros (OS_CHECK_STRING/OS_CHECK_PATHNAME) were provided and contained memcmp-based string comparisons, those would be potentially suspicious \u2014 but those implementations are not part of the supplied code, so they cannot be reported here."
