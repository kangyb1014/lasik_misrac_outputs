  "explanation": "Most pointers in the provided code are already const-qualified where appropriate (for example, the OS_rmfs parameter is const char * and the implementation function for stopping a volume takes a const OS_object_token_t *). The finalize/delete routine accepts a non-const token because it restores/clears the object ID and calls a transaction finish function that is expected to modify the token state. Other pointer usages shown either match their intent (read-only pointers are const) or clearly require write access. Therefore only the listed fragments need further investigation for possible const-qualification issues."
