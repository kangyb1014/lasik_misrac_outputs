  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Every pointer parameter in the provided code is either already const-qualified where it is not modified, or is deliberately non-const because the pointed-to object is modified or passed to APIs that require a non-const pointer:\n\n- OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl takes const OS_object_token_t *token (correct) and constructs a local struct timespec ts which it passes by address; the callee OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl expects const struct timespec *timeout, so the call respects const-correctness.\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl accepts const OS_object_token_t *token and const struct timespec *timeout (both const-qualified appropriately). Its local sem pointer is non-const because the function modifies sem->current_value, sem->flush_request is observed, and it calls pthread operations that change the semaphore internals.\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime takes struct timespec *tm and modifies the pointed-to timespec (computes absolute time), so it must be non-const.\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex takes pthread_mutex_t *mut and invokes pthread_mutex_timedlock which modifies the mutex; it therefore must be non-const.\n- pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cond_timedwait, pthread_cleanup_push and the cleanup handler operate on mutable synchronization objects (pthread_cond_t, pthread_mutex_t), so the pointers passed to them must be non-const.\n- The helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a const OS_object_token_t *token (correct), and other uses of token only read from it.\n\nGiven these points, there are no pointer parameters that appear to be unintentionally non-const and thus no fragments needing investigation under Rule 8.13."
