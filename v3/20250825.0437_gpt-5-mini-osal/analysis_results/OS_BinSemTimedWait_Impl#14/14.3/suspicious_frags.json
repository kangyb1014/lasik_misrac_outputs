  "explanation": "I selected all control statements present in the provided code (while and all if/else-if checks and the pthread_cleanup push/pop pair) because Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions that might be invariant; these constructs should be examined to ensure the controlling expressions are not effectively constant in the compilation/execution context (taking into account concurrency, shared state, and appropriate qualifiers such as volatile/atomic). Other fragments in the code were not selected because they are not controlling expressions (e.g. assignments, arithmetic, return statements, function call statements like pthread_cond_wait() without a controlling expression) or are simple computations that do not control flow. The selected list therefore covers all locations in the supplied code where a loop or conditional controlling expression exists and thus where an invariant controlling expression issue could arise."
