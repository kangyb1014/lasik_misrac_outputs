  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression if (tm->tv_nsec >= 1000000000L) is not invariant: tm->tv_nsec is obtained from clock_gettime and then modified by adding (msecs % 1000) * 1000000L, so its value depends on runtime state and input. This is a runtime-varying expression used to detect nanosecond overflow and adjust tv_sec/tv_nsec accordingly. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not violated."
