  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: This function is called directly by the target. To determine whether any controlling expression in the overall execution (including loops/conditionals used to compute or validate the absolute time) is invariant, the body of this function must be inspected.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: The target returns the result of this call. Any loop or conditional in the callee (for example, waiting loops, retry loops, or timeout checks) could contain an invariant controlling expression. The callee and its control flow must be analyzed.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: This is a direct callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. If OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl uses it inside loops or conditionals, that code path could produce invariant controlling expressions; therefore its implementation is required.\n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Another direct callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. This routine is likely to contain synchronization/wait loops (mutex/cond handling). Its control expressions must be inspected for invariance.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (type): The target function takes a pointer to this type. Fields of the token may be read by callees and used in controlling expressions. The token layout/semantics are needed to understand whether expressions based on its fields are invariant.\n\n- struct timespec (type): This is written by OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and passed into the semaphore-take implementation. Understanding its fields and how they are computed/used is necessary to determine whether time-based controlling expressions are invariant.\n\n- uint32 and int32 (typedefs): The integer widths/signedness can affect whether expressions are considered invariant (e.g., constant folding, integer promotions, or trivial constant expressions). Their definitions are required to correctly evaluate expressions in the callees.\n\n- timeout/status macros/constants used by the above functions (e.g. OS_WAIT_FOREVER, OS_SEM_TIMEOUT, OS_SUCCESS): Callees often use named constants in controlling expressions (timeouts, return-status checks). Those macro values are required to determine if a controlling expression is actually a constant/invariant.\n\n- errno and POSIX return macros used by the above functions (e.g. EINTR): POSIX wrappers commonly loop on EINTR or check specific error codes in controlling expressions. The definitions and usage of these macros are needed to see whether such conditions form invariant expressions.\n\n- prototypes/definitions of any POSIX APIs used by the above functions (e.g. clock_gettime, pthread_cond_timedwait, nanosleep): The callees may call POSIX APIs and base loop/conditional decisions on their return values. Knowing which POSIX APIs are invoked and their semantics/return values is necessary to judge whether corresponding controlling expressions are invariant.\n\nIn summary: although the target function itself contains no explicit controlling expressions, any invariant controlling expressions relevant to MISRA C may appear in the transitive callees or be affected by the types/macros used. The above symbols are the minimal set needed to inspect those code paths and decide if the MISRA rule is violated."
