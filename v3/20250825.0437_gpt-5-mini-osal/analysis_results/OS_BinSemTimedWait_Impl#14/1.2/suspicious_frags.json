  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs (function definition, const pointer parameter, typedefed integer types, struct timespec from POSIX time.h, and a function call). There are no compiler-specific extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __declspec, inline assembly (__asm__), nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, or other documented compiler extensions. The parenthesized return expression is valid standard C and not an extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the supplied code."
