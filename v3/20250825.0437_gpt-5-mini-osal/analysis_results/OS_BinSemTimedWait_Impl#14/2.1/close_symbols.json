  "explanation": "- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: Need the function prototype and implementation to determine whether it can fail-to-return (e.g. contains longjmp/exit/abort or is declared noreturn) or expands to a macro that alters control flow. If it does not return, code after it in the target would be unreachable.\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: The target directly returns the result of this call. Its prototype/implementation may include attributes (noreturn) or internal control-flow (infinite loop, longjmp, exit) that affect reachability of any following statements or callers. Inspecting its definition is required.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: This is a callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl (from the static call graph). A nested callee could itself be noreturn or otherwise alter control flow, so its definition is needed to fully determine reachability through the call chain.\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Also a callee of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl; include its definition for the same reason as above (nested callees can make paths unreachable).\n- OS_object_token_t (typedef): The token type declaration/definition is needed to ensure it is not a macro or special type that could change the compiled control flow of the function (e.g. if token is a macro that expands to something affecting control flow) and to verify there are no unusual attributes.\n- struct timespec (definition): Include the definition to ensure there are no macros/attribute decorations on timespec or its initialization that could affect control flow (or hidden compile-time constructs).\n\nIn short: analyze the direct callees and their nested callees (and the involved types) to detect any non-returning behavior or macros that would make portions of the target function unreachable."
