  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl is dead code you must determine whether it is ever called (reachability) and whether removing it would change program behaviour (side effects of calls it performs). The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_BinSemTimedWait: Direct caller shown in the static call graph. Inspect this function to see all call sites, conditional paths, and whether the Impl variant is invoked in normal or test builds; this determines reachability.\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: Direct callee that computes the absolute timeout. You must know if it has observable side effects (global state, errno, I/O, timing behaviour) whose removal would change program behaviour even if the call seems only to compute a timespec.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: Direct callee that performs the semaphore take. Removing the timed-wait wrapper might remove calls into this routine; you must inspect its behaviour and side effects to determine if eliminating OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl would change program behaviour.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Callees of OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl shown in the graph. These help determine whether GenericBinSemTake_Impl has important side effects (state changes, locking, callbacks or recursion) that make the timed-wait wrapper non-removable.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Callee of OS_BinSemTimedWait. Examining this and surrounding code in the caller shows whether OS_BinSemTimedWait conditionally calls the Impl, or whether the caller is only used in certain build modes; this affects whether the Impl is effectively dead.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These unit-test/stub hooks appear in the caller OS_BinSemTimedWait. Test stubs or registration mechanisms can cause indirect calls, override behaviour, or make the Impl reachable only under test configurations. You must examine these to see whether the Impl is used in production, only in tests, or reachable via test-time registration \u2014 all relevant to deciding if the Impl is truly dead.\n\nAdditionally, while not individual symbols listed above, you should also inspect any function-pointer tables, registration/dispatch tables, or build-time symbol exports that could reference OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl (linker map, header prototypes) to ensure there are no other indirect callers. These artifacts determine real-world removability and thus whether the code is dead under MISRA's rule."
