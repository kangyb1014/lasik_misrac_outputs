  "explanation": "To decide if UtAssert_DoReport violates the MISRA rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" you must know the const-qualification requirements of all pointers that are passed to or obtained from external interfaces and the types used in the function:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText (declaration and docs): The most important symbol. The const-qualification of the parameter that receives the text to be output (e.g., whether it is declared as const char * or char *) determines whether passing ReportBuffer (a modifiable char array) or BasePtr/ShortDesc (const char *) is compatible with the MISRA guidance. If UT_BSP_DoText's parameter could be const-qualified but is declared non-const, that indicates a potential MISRA violation originating in UT_BSP_DoText (and affecting callers). Also need documentation/implementation detail to know whether UT_BSP_DoText actually modifies the buffer at runtime.\n\n- snprintf (declaration): The prototype shows the first parameter is a non-const char * (it must be writable). This confirms ReportBuffer must be non-const because it is written by snprintf; therefore ReportBuffer being non-const is appropriate. Including snprintf lets the analyzer verify that ReportBuffer cannot (and should not) be const.\n\n- strlen (declaration): Confirms it accepts a const char *; this validates that File being declared const char * is appropriate and that using strlen does not require removing const.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32 and uint8: Provide the precise underlying types (e.g., typedef unsigned int uint32;) so the analyzer can confirm there are no pointer-to-non-const issues introduced via these typedefs or unexpected pointer-to-integer casts. They are part of the function signature and casts in the snprintf call.\n\n- typedef/definition of size_t: Required because strlen and snprintf use size_t; the exact typedef is needed to fully type-check the function declarations/prototypes in the analysis environment.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether any pointer passed into or out of UtAssert_DoReport could or should be const-qualified (for example, whether UT_BSP_DoText's parameter could be changed to const char * or whether any const is being incorrectly discarded)."
