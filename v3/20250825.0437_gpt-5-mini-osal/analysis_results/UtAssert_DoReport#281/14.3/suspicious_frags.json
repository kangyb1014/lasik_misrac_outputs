  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The while loop uses FileLen (while (FileLen > 0)), and FileLen is decremented inside the loop, so the controlling expression is variant. The if ( *BasePtr == '/' || *BasePtr == '\\' ) tests *BasePtr, and BasePtr is decremented each iteration (and then incremented if the condition is met), so that controlling expression is also variant. There are no do-while loops or other conditionals with constant/invariant expressions. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for Rule 14.3 in this code."
