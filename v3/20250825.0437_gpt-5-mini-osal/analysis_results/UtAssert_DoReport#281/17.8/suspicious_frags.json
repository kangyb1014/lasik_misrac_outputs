  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Details:\n- The parameters are: const char *File, uint32 LineNum, uint32 SegmentNum, uint32 TestSeq, uint8 MessageType, const char *SubsysName, const char *ShortDesc. None of these identifiers are assigned to or incremented/decremented anywhere in the function.\n- BasePtr is a local variable (const char *BasePtr) and is initialized from File + FileLen; subsequent --BasePtr operations modify the local BasePtr, not the parameter File itself. Pointer arithmetic on File to compute a local pointer does not modify the File parameter.\n- FileLen is a local uint32 variable used to hold strlen(File) and is decremented locally; it does not affect the LineNum/SegmentNum/TestSeq parameters.\n- The code only reads through the memory pointed to by File/BasePtr (checks *BasePtr) \u2014 it does not write to that memory (and BasePtr is a pointer to const char), so no modification of the pointed-to object occurs.\n- The parameters passed into snprintf and UT_BSP_DoText are passed by value (or as const pointers for %s) and are not modified by the function calls in this code.\n- SubsysName is unused in this function; unused does not imply modification.\n\nBecause there are no assignments or increment/decrement operations applied to any parameter identifier, and no casting that leads to parameter modification, there are no fragments to investigate for noncompliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
