  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C unreachable-code violations inside OS_Console_CopyOut you must know the concrete types, value ranges and calling-context that determine which branches and breaks can actually execute:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t (complete struct definition): The function reads and writes console->BufBase, console->BufSize and console->ReadPos. To decide whether code paths (for example the WriteOffset >= console->BufSize branch, the WriteOffset == console->ReadPos branch, or the buffer indexing statement) are reachable you need the exact field types and semantics.\n\n- Definition/type of BufBase: Whether BufBase is a pointer, array, or something else affects whether the assignment console->BufBase[WriteOffset] is legal and whether certain indices are possible. This impacts reachability of the write statement and subsequent branches.\n\n- Definitions/typedefs for int32 and size_t: Knowing signedness and width (and that size_t is unsigned) is necessary to reason about comparisons, underflow/overflow, and whether some numeric comparisons are always true/false (which could make code unreachable).\n\n- Definition of the boolean symbol \"true\": The loop is written as while(true). Confirming the definition/expansion of true ensures the loop is an unconditional loop as intended \u2014 important when reasoning about reachability of the loop body and the break statements.\n\n- OS_ConsoleWrite (caller) \u2014 full signature and call-site code: The caller supplies Str and NextWritePos (and likely which console instance). To determine if e.g. the *pmsg==0 condition can occur or whether NextWritePos/WriteOffset values passed make some branches impossible, you must see how these arguments are produced (could NextWritePos already equal ReadPos, could Str be NULL or an empty string?).\n\n- Console initialization/creation/modification routines that set BufSize, ReadPos and BufBase: Static values or invariants established at initialization (for example BufSize never zero, ReadPos <= BufSize-1, BufBase non-NULL) are needed to determine whether branches like wrapping (WriteOffset >= BufSize) or out-of-space (WriteOffset == ReadPos) can actually occur; such invariants can make code paths unreachable.\n\n- Macro/enum definitions for OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, OS_QUEUE_FULL: While these do not typically affect reachability, their definitions are needed to confirm the code's intended control flow (returned values on break) and to ensure there are no surprising macro expansions that alter flow or make labels/statements unreachable.\n\nProviding these symbols and the caller/initializer code lets an analyzer determine whether any statements inside OS_Console_CopyOut can never be executed under the program's real invariants (i.e., whether there is unreachable code)."
