  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 specifically targets use of the Standard Library string functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) and requires that their use does not access beyond object bounds. The provided function OS_Console_CopyOut does not call any <string.h> functions. Therefore there are no code fragments invoking those functions to be investigated under Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: the function does perform pointer dereference of Str via pmsg and writes into console->BufBase using an index. Those operations could be relevant to other MISRA rules (bounds checking, null-pointer use, or data-flow rules), and it would be appropriate for other reviewers to check that NextWritePos, console->BufSize, console->BufBase, console->ReadPos, and Str are valid and that Str is properly null-terminated by its producer. However, these concerns are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 because no <string.h> functions are used in this fragment."
