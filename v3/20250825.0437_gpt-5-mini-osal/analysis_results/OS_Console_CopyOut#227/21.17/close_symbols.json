  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t (struct definition): The function indexes console->BufBase using WriteOffset and compares WriteOffset with console->BufSize and console->ReadPos. The struct definition reveals the exact types of BufBase, BufSize and ReadPos (e.g., whether BufBase is a pointer or an embedded array, and the integer types used). This is required to determine the valid index range and whether the expression console->BufBase[WriteOffset] can legally access the referenced object.\n\n- console buffer allocation/initialization code that sets console->BufBase and console->BufSize (e.g. OS_ConsoleCreate / OS_ConsoleInit): Knowing how BufBase is allocated and how BufSize is initialized (and whether BufSize can be zero or inconsistent with the actual allocation) is essential to determine if indexing by WriteOffset can run past the allocated object. If BufBase is NULL, or BufSize does not match the actual allocation, the code could produce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_ConsoleWrite (caller): The caller provides the pointer NextWritePos (the function reads *NextWritePos into WriteOffset). To determine whether the initial WriteOffset value is guaranteed to be within [0, BufSize-1], we need to see how OS_ConsoleWrite derives/passes NextWritePos and any preconditions it enforces.\n\n- All functions that modify console->ReadPos and any code that updates *NextWritePos (e.g. OS_ConsoleRead, console reset/advance routines): This routine uses console->ReadPos to detect full buffer and updates *NextWritePos on success. To prove no out-of-bounds access you must know the invariants on ReadPos and NextWritePos maintained by other code paths (for example that ReadPos and NextWritePos are always in-bounds and updated atomically/consistently). Without these, the runtime relationship between WriteOffset and BufSize/ReadPos cannot be established.\n\n- Declaration/allocation site of console->BufBase (embedded array size or malloc call): If BufBase is an embedded array the array size is needed; if it is dynamically allocated the allocation size must be known. This tells you the number of addressable elements and thus whether console->BufBase[WriteOffset] may access beyond the object.\n\n- Any compile-time constants or invariants that constrain BufSize (e.g. OS_MAX_CONSOLE_BUFFER_SIZE): If the implementation uses constants, asserts or static checks that bound BufSize or enforce non-zero size, those guarantee safety properties needed to conclude no out-of-bounds access. These invariants are part of the proof required by the MISRA rule.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the necessary information to decide whether the character copy loop can ever index beyond the bounds of the object referenced by console->BufBase (the central concern of the cited MISRA C rule)."
