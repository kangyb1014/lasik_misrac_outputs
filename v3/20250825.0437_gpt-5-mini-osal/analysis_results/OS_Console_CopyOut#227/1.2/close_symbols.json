  "explanation": "For determining whether OS_Console_CopyOut uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions that the function relies on because typedefs/macros/structure members can hide non\u2011standard constructs. Explainations:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t: The full struct definition must be checked for any compiler extensions on the type itself (e.g. __attribute__, packed/aligned extensions, compiler-specific storage classes) and to find the member types.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.BufBase: The element type of BufBase (pointer vs array, qualifiers like volatile, or nonstandard pointer qualifiers such as __far/__near) may use compiler extensions or nonstandard pointer types; you must verify its declaration.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.BufSize: The type of BufSize (e.g. size_t, custom integer typedef, use of variable length array sizes, or compiler-specific integer types) can hide extensions\u2014inspect its definition.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.ReadPos: ReadPos type/attributes could use extensions (bitfields with nonstandard types, compiler attributes) that affect legality under MISRA\u2014inspect it.\n- int32: This identifier is a typedef (not a standard C keyword). Its underlying definition must be checked to ensure it is not implemented via a compiler-specific extension (for example a built\u2011in nonstandard integer type or compiler attribute).\n- size_t: Although standard in C, the actual project typedef/include could redefine size_t or map it via compiler extensions; verify its definition/headers used in the build.\n- OS_ERROR: Macro/constant definitions must be inspected to ensure they do not expand to compiler extensions (e.g. use of __builtin__, __attribute__, asm or other nonstandard tokens).\n- OS_SUCCESS: Same rationale as OS_ERROR \u2014 constant/macro expansion may hide extensions.\n- OS_QUEUE_FULL: Same rationale as OS_ERROR \u2014 inspect the macro/constant for nonstandard constructs.\n- true: The token true must be resolved to its definition (e.g. from <stdbool.h> or a project macro). If true is a language extension or is provided via a compiler extension rather than the standard boolean header, that would violate the rule. Also check for any nonstandard boolean types or macros.\n\nOnly by examining these definitions can you determine if any nonstandard compiler extensions are used in the target function's code paths or types. The remaining identifiers in the function (standard operators, pointer dereference, while, static, break, ++, array indexing) are standard C constructs and do not require additional symbols to check for extensions."
