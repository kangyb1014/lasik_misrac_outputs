  "explanation": "Only the while (true) controlling expression in the function is a compile-time invariant and therefore warrants investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All other controlling expressions in the function are data-dependent at runtime: the if conditions (if (*pmsg == 0), if (WriteOffset >= console->BufSize), if (WriteOffset == console->ReadPos)) depend on variables or memory contents and are not invariant. There is no do-while with a constant controlling expression, no for-loop with a constant bound, and no other constant controlling expressions present. Assignments and buffer accesses are not controlling expressions for the purposes of this rule."
