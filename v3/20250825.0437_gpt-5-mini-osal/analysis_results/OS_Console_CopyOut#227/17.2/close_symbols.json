  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Console_CopyOut participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect its callers and any functions reachable from those callers that might call back into OS_Console_CopyOut (or form a cycle). The required symbols: \n\n- OS_ConsoleWrite: immediate caller of OS_Console_CopyOut; any call-path starting here could lead back to OS_Console_CopyOut and create indirect recursion. \n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: callee of OS_ConsoleWrite; must be checked in case it (directly or via its callees) calls OS_Console_CopyOut or re-enters OS_ConsoleWrite. \n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: callee of OS_ConsoleWrite; same reason as above. \n- OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl: callee of OS_ConsoleWrite; inspect for calls that could return control into OS_Console_CopyOut or OS_ConsoleWrite. \n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl: callee of OS_ConsoleWrite; likely candidate to perform further console operations\u2014must be checked for calls to OS_Console_CopyOut or other functions that form a cycle. \n- OS_ObjectIdRelease: callee of OS_ConsoleWrite; include to ensure it does not call back into console functions. \n- OS_printf: listed as a caller of OS_ConsoleWrite; include its implementation to understand the full call graph around OS_ConsoleWrite (and to detect any unexpected call-back paths). \n\nInspecting the source (or static call graph) for each of these symbols is sufficient to determine whether any call chain starting at OS_Console_CopyOut can lead back to it (violating the MISRA rule)."
