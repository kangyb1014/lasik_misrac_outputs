  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.2 forbids direct or indirect recursion. The code fragments selected are call sites that can plausibly form an indirect recursion chain and therefore must be investigated: specifically OS_ConsoleWrite can call OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl (or wake an async task), OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl calls the platform hook OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, and OS_printf calls OS_ConsoleWrite. A realistic recursive cycle to check is: OS_printf -> OS_ConsoleWrite -> OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl -> OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl -> (platform code) -> OS_printf. Also OS_DEBUG (used inside OS_printf when not initialized) may itself call output routines that lead back to OS_ConsoleWrite; therefore its call site is flagged. The OS_ObjectIdGetById call in OS_ConsoleWrite is flagged because token/lookup routines could in some implementations perform callbacks or logging that must be checked for indirect recursion.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT flagged:\n- The body of OS_Console_CopyOut contains no function calls (it only manipulates the buffer and pointers). Since it does not invoke other functions, it cannot by itself form a recursive call and therefore does not need investigation for Rule 17.2.\n- Inline/simple accessors such as OS_ObjectIndexFromToken merely return a field and contain no calls, so they cannot cause recursion.\n- OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl as shown only performs a sem_post on an implementation table entry (sem_post(&local->data_sem)); sem_post is a POSIX primitive and does not call back into the OS console APIs in the provided code. Nonetheless the higher-level wakeup call site is included because the async path leads to the utility task which may call output functions; investigators should verify the task does not call OS_printf/OS_ConsoleWrite in a way that creates recursion.\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease only delegates to transaction finish helpers; the shown usage does not directly call console output routines. If platform-specific transaction finish hooks exist, they should be reviewed, but the common pattern shown does not indicate recursion by itself.\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl / OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl are lock primitives around the output; they do not themselves perform output in the provided code and so are not likely recursion sources.\n\nInvestigation should focus on the flagged call sites and any platform/implementation hooks they invoke (notably OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_DEBUG, and any token/transaction callbacks) to determine if any path can lead back to OS_ConsoleWrite or OS_Console_CopyOut, creating direct or indirect recursion."
