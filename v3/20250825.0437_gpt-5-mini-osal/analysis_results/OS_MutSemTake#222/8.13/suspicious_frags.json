  "explanation": "Only code that involves pointers or the address-of operator are relevant to Rule 8.13. The fragments listed above are the occurrences in this function where pointer types or pointer dereferences appear and therefore should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types could or should be const-qualified. Other parts of the function do not involve pointers (e.g. sem_id and return_code declarations/usages, the final return statement, and the call to OS_TaskGetId() as an rvalue) and thus are not relevant to this rule and do not need investigation for const qualification of pointer targets."
