  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only pointer in the function is the parameter token, which is declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token), satisfying MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer uses in this function to inspect. The function is a no-op and does not modify or dereference the token, so no additional const-qualification is required."
