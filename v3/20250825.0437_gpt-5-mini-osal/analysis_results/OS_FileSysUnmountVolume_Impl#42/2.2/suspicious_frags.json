  "explanation": "The rest of the code in the provided snippets should not be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code) because those fragments perform observable actions or affect control flow and therefore are not candidates for removal without changing program behaviour. Specifically:\n\n- Parameter checking (OS_CHECK_STRING) and object lookup (OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch) influence whether the unmount attempt proceeds and are not dead.\n- The retrieval of the filesys record (filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) and the subsequent state test on filesys->flags select permitted operation paths and are required for correct behaviour.\n- The assignment of return_code in error paths (e.g., OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE) and the final mapping to OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND (if return_code != OS_SUCCESS) alter the function's observable return value and thus are not dead.\n- The side-effect that clears the mounted flags (filesys->flags &= ~(...)) is an explicit state change; removing it would change program behaviour.\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) and other housekeeping calls have side-effects (resource release) and cannot be removed safely.\n- Definitions and macros (e.g. #define OS_SUCCESS (0), typedefs) are not executable code or are needed by the executable code and therefore are not dead.\n\nAccordingly, only the no-op implementation of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (and its invocation) appear to be executed but perform no effect and always return success, and thus merit investigation for potential dead code under Rule 2.2."
