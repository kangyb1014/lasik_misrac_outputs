  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns OS_SUCCESS. To decide whether any controlling expression is implicitly present (for example if OS_SUCCESS is a macro that expands into an expression with control-flow or an invariant boolean expression), the analyzer must see its definition. This confirms the return value is a simple constant and not a hidden invariant controlling expression.\n- OS_object_token_t: The function takes a parameter of this type (const OS_object_token_t *token). While the parameter is unused in the body, the type definition is needed to ensure there are no hidden macros or inline functions tied to the type that could introduce invariant controlling expressions when the function is compiled (e.g., via attribute or wrapper macros).\n- int32: The function return type is int32. The typedef/definition should be checked to ensure it is a plain integer typedef (not a macro or alias that could expand into an expression). This rules out any unusual macro expansions that might introduce controlling expressions.\n\nNote: The target function contains no conditional, loop, or switch controlling expressions. The above symbols are sufficient to verify there are no hidden macro/type expansions that would create invariant controlling expressions inside this function."
