  "explanation": "- OS_unmount: This is the direct caller shown in the static call graph. You must inspect OS_unmount to see whether it actually calls OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl unconditionally, conditionally, or is itself unreachable/unused. If OS_unmount never executes, the target function may be unreachable.\n- main: The usual program entry point. To decide reachability for MISRA (no unreachable code) you need to know whether there is a call chain from main to OS_unmount (or to any other caller of the target).\n- _start: C runtime/startup entry used on hosted environments; some call chains originate from _start rather than main. Check this symbol if present in the build to ensure no alternative startup path is the root of calls to OS_unmount/target.\n- Reset_Handler: Typical embedded reset/startup entry. On embedded targets the reset handler (or equivalent) can call initialization routines that eventually reach OS_unmount; include it to cover embedded entry paths.\n- OS_filesys_registration_table (or any filesystem ops/registration symbol): Many OS filesystem implementations call through tables of function pointers (mount/unmount ops). The target could be reachable only via being registered in such a table rather than via a direct call; you must inspect these registration symbols to see whether the function pointer is stored/used.\n- interrupt vector table / ISR registration symbols: Some entry paths are triggered by interrupts or callbacks; if any ISR or callback can reach OS_unmount (or holds a pointer to the target), that makes the function reachable. Check relevant vector/registration symbols.\n- linker symbol map / build-unit symbol table: A final determination of unreachable code may require checking the link map (which object modules are linked, which symbols are discarded by the linker/optimizer). The link map tells you whether the translation unit containing OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is ever pulled into the final binary or discarded as unused.\n\nCollectively, these symbols/artefacts let you determine if there exists any execution path (direct call chain, table-driven call, startup/init path, ISR/callback, or link-time inclusion) that can reach OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. If no path or reference exists in any of these, the function would be unreachable and violate the MISRA rule."
