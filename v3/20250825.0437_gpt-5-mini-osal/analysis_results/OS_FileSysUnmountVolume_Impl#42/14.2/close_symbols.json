  "explanation": "Purpose: The MISRA rule concerns a for-loop's clauses and also requires considering the behaviour of any functions called from within a for-loop body. Although OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl has no for-loops itself, to determine if it can cause a MISRA-for violation when invoked from a caller you must inspect the caller(s) and any objects the function touches.\n\nWhy each symbol is required:\n- OS_unmount: It is the direct caller (per the static call graph). You must inspect OS_unmount to see if it calls OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl from inside a for loop, and whether that loop has a loop counter or loop-control flag that could be affected by this callee's behaviour.\n- OS_object_token_t: The target function takes this pointer type as parameter. To prove the function does not modify any caller loop counter or other objects reachable via the token, you need the type definition to see whether it aliases (points to) objects that could serve as loop counters or be otherwise modified.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this macro/constant. Its definition should be checked to ensure it does not have side effects (it should be a simple integral constant). If it were a function-like macro with side effects, that could matter for loop-clause analysis.\n- OS_printf: Present in OS_unmount's callee list; if OS_unmount contains loops that call OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl and also call OS_printf in the same loop body, the combined behaviour must be considered (e.g., side effects, modifications of globals used as loop counters). Include to inspect side effects and interactions.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch: Called by OS_unmount; may read/modify global or shared state or objects that could be used as loop counters. Needed to determine whether objects passed into or returned to the loop are modified inside the body.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_unmount; converts tokens to indices\u2014relevant to determine whether the token passed to OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl aliases a loop counter or is used/modified in the loop.\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease: Called by OS_unmount; may modify global object tables or the token target. Required to verify whether the callee or the caller modify objects that are used as loop counters.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: Part of OS_unmount's callees (unit-test stubs). Include to check any test harness or stubbed behaviour that could modify state visible to the loop.\n- UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: Stub helper that can modify memory/state used by the caller; include to ensure no hidden side effects relevant to loop counters.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData: Test-stub registration functions reachable from OS_unmount; include to rule out any instrumentation that might alter program state used by loops.\n\nIn short: analyze OS_unmount (and the listed functions it calls) to see whether OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is invoked inside a for-loop and whether the callee or any of these symbols modify the loop counter or objects used in the loop condition. Also inspect the token type and OS_SUCCESS macro to confirm the target function itself has no side-effects that would affect a loop's well-formedness."
