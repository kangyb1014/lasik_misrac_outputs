  "explanation": "OS_SUCCESS \u2014 The function simply returns OS_SUCCESS. To prove no <string.h> functions are invoked, the exact definition of OS_SUCCESS must be inspected to ensure it is a simple integer constant or enum and not a macro or inline/function-like expansion that calls or wraps any string.h routine (e.g., via logging macros or wrapper functions).\\n\\nOS_object_token_t \u2014 Although the parameter is unused in the body, its typedef or any macro surrounding its declaration must be checked to ensure there is no hidden expansion or side-effect (for example, a macro that expands to expressions or inline code that could call string.h functions). Verifying the type/definition confirms the function body contains no indirect string handling."
