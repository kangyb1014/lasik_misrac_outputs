  "explanation": "I searched the provided function and related definitions for any use of memcmp or any memory-comparison of C strings. There are no calls to memcmp, nor any other explicit memory-comparison operations on null-terminated strings (no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp usage). The code uses memset to zero a local union, pthread_setcancelstate/ pthread_setcanceltype/ pthread_setspecific, and strerror only to format an error message \u2014 strerror returns a char* but is not compared with memcmp. The macros provided (OS_DEBUG, OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR) do not introduce any memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14, so nothing needs to be flagged for investigation with respect to that rule."
