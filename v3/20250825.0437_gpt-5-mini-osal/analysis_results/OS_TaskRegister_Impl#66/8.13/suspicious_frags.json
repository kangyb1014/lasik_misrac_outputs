  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could reasonably be const-qualified. Examples: the local scalar declarations (return_code, old_state, old_type, arg) are not pointer types; the memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)); call operates on a non-const destination (memset requires a modifiable object) so const qualification would be inappropriate; the assignment arg.id = global_task_id; writes to a union member (not a pointer target). The selected lines are the only places where pointer types or returned pointer values are passed between APIs (the pthread_* calls and the use of strerror) and thus warrant verification that the pointer target types are correctly const-qualified (or that const qualification is intentionally not possible due to API requirements)."
