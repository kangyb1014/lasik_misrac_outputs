  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> in this function are the two shown above (memset and strerror). MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of the string handling functions from <string.h>. The remaining code lines call pthread APIs, perform assignments, or use non-<string.h> facilities (e.g. pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, pthread_setspecific, the union member assignment, and the return handling). These are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and therefore do not require investigation under this rule."
