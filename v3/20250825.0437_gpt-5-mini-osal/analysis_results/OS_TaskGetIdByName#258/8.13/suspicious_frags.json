  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rationale:\n- The input string parameters (task_name in OS_TaskGetIdByName and name in OS_ObjectIdFindByName) are already const-qualified, satisfying Rule 8.13 for read-only character data.\n- The osal_id_t * parameters (task_id and object_id) are used as output parameters (the functions write the resolved ID into the caller-supplied storage). These must be non-const so the functions can store results, so they are not candidates for adding const.\n- The local token variable is an internal object token passed by address to OS_ObjectIdGetByName and OS_ObjectIdRelease; such functions typically mutate or manage the token, so the pointer must not be const. The provided code shows token.obj_id is read out and OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) is called, indicating mutation/management rather than read-only access.\n- The pointer-check macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) are used only to validate or examine the pointer values; they do not imply missing const-qualification in the function signatures shown.\nGiven the available code, all pointer parameters that can be const are const-qualified, and the non-const pointers are used for legitimate mutable/output purposes, so there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 8.13 in the supplied code."
