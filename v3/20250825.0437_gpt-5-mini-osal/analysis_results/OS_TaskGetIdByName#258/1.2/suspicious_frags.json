  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The code consists of standard C function definitions, typedefs, and function-like macro invocations only. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), GCC nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords in the shown fragments. The macros shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, BUGCHECK) are used in a conventional way; their visible expansions are ordinary expressions and do not themselves reveal any extension usage. The typedefs (osal_id_t, int32) are standard typedefs and the integer type names (e.g., uint32, int32_t) are typical fixed-width types, not language extensions. Based on the provided code, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2. If the hidden definitions of macros such as BUGCHECK, ARGCHECK, or other omitted code contain vendor-specific constructs, those specific definitions would need to be reported \u2014 but they are not present in the supplied fragments, so they cannot be flagged here."
