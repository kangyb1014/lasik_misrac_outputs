  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t\n  Needed to know the exact type layout, so that pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym) is meaningful and changes the address (size, field types). Also to confirm the types of Name and Module (pointer vs array) because that affects the semantics of the Name == NULL test and whether reading Name could have side effects (e.g. volatile).\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n  The while controlling expression depends on the initial value of StaticSym (initialized from this symbol). To decide if StaticSym != NULL is invariant you must know whether OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is NULL or a pointer into an actual table, and whether it is a compile-time constant or something that could change elsewhere.\n\n- Definition/initializer of the static symbol table object(s) that OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE points to (the array of OS_static_symbol_record_t and its terminator)\n  The loop relies on a sentinel (StaticSym->Name == NULL) to terminate or on finding Module match. To determine if StaticSym != NULL can remain true indefinitely you must inspect the table contents/initializer to see whether a terminating record with Name == NULL exists, or whether the table could be a non-terminated array (which would make the controlling expression effectively invariant and cause an unbounded loop).\n\n- Declarations/types of the 'Name' and 'Module' fields in OS_static_symbol_record_t (including const/volatile qualifiers)\n  Knowing whether these fields are pointers, arrays, or volatile-qualified influences whether Name == NULL is a valid/meaningful sentinel check and whether reads could have side effects that affect loop termination. Volatile or special qualifiers could change whether the controlling expression is considered invariant.\n\nThese symbols and definitions together are sufficient to determine if the loop's controlling expression (StaticSym != NULL) can be invariant (always true/false) in normal program execution, and thus whether the code violates MISRA C rule about invariant controlling expressions."
