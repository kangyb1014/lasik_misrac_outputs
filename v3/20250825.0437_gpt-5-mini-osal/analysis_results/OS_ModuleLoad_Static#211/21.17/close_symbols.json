  "explanation": "1) OS_static_symbol_record_t\n   - Need the struct definition to know the exact types and layout of the fields (in particular Name and Module). If these are pointers (char *) vs arrays (char[N]) affects whether strcmp can legally read through them and also whether StaticSym++ pointer arithmetic is valid. Knowing the member types and offsets is required to reason about whether strcmp will be given valid, null-terminated char * pointers and whether the ++ traversal is within the array element size.\n\n2) OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n   - Need the symbol that supplies the starting pointer to the static table to determine its storage model (pointer to array, pointer to single element, location in ROM/flash, etc.). Its definition tells us whether the loop's sentinel check (StaticSym->Name == NULL) is correct and whether incrementing StaticSym++ can run off the end of the allocated array (which would make subsequent strcmp accesses out-of-bounds).\n\n3) (static table) initializers / definitions of the entries referenced by OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (the actual Module string objects)\n   - It's essential to see how the Module field values are created (string literals, pointers into other buffers, or non-terminated memory). strcmp reads until a NUL terminator; if Module points to non-terminated buffers or to memory shorter than expected, strcmp could read beyond bounds. The concrete initializers show whether Module always points to NUL-terminated strings and whether any runtime lifetime/placement issues exist.\n\n4) strcmp (prototype / semantics from <string.h>)\n   - To apply the MISRA rule you must consider the exact behavior of the string function used: strcmp scans both operands until a NUL is found and requires both pointers be non-NULL and point to NUL-terminated arrays; it can read arbitrary bytes until termination. Explicitly including the strcmp specification ensures the analysis checks the correct access pattern and preconditions (non-NULL, NUL-termination).\n\n5) OS_ModuleLoad (caller implementation / precondition checks on ModuleName)\n   - The target function does not check ModuleName for NULL or validity. To determine if the use of strcmp inside OS_ModuleLoad_Static can violate the rule you must know whether callers (notably OS_ModuleLoad) guarantee ModuleName is non-NULL and NUL-terminated before calling OS_ModuleLoad_Static. If the caller does not enforce these preconditions, the strcmp call could dereference or read beyond the bounds of ModuleName, violating the MISRA rule.\n\nSummary: to decide whether the strcmp usage can access beyond object bounds you must know (a) the types and layout of the table entries, (b) the actual Module string storage and termination, (c) that the static table traversal cannot run past allocated memory, (d) the exact behavior/requirements of strcmp, and (e) whether callers ensure ModuleName validity. These symbols/definitions provide that information."
