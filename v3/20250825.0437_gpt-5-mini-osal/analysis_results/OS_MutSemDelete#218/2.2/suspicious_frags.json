  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments as suspicious because, based on the provided code, they are either obviously used in subsequent operations or are part of necessary locking/transaction flows and therefore cannot be assumed dead without broader analysis of call sites and global state:\n\n- Assignments to return_code and the subsequent call to OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete use the earlier result, so the intermediate assignment is not dead.\n- Lock/unlock calls and the TransactionInit/Cancel/Finish sequence are part of the object token lifecycle; removing them would clearly change synchronization and behaviour.\n- The OS_MutSemDelete_Impl calls pthread_mutex_destroy and returns an error code; both branches (success/failure) affect control flow in FinalizeDelete and must be preserved.\n- OS_NotifyEvent returns the application handler result (or OS_SUCCESS when no handler). Even if callers ignore the returned value in some places, the call itself produces side effects (application callbacks) and cannot be assumed removable.\n\nThe fragments I selected warrant further investigation because:\n- The initial memset and the obj_idx initialization may be redundant in some code paths or always overwritten before use, making them potential dead operations.\n- token->obj_id = id may be redundant if the same value is restored/overwritten elsewhere in all call paths.\n- The else-if branch in TransactionFinish that restores record->active_id from token->obj_id might never be reached if all callers always pass a non-NULL final_id; if so it would be dead.\n- The static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken function and the local declarations in OS_MutSemDelete_Impl (shown) may be unused or unnecessary in the project build/configuration, which would make them dead code.\n\nFurther project-wide call-site analysis and build/config checks are required to confirm whether these fragments are truly dead."
