  "explanation": "The only pointer occurrence in this function is the parameter 'Addr' and its use in the call to OS_SocketBindAddress. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and const-qualification \u2014 thus the declaration line and the call site must be investigated (notably to check the prototype/signature of OS_SocketBindAddress to verify whether it accepts a const-qualified pointer). All other lines in this function involve integer variables/returns or calls that do not pass pointer arguments (for example OS_SocketListen(sock_id)) and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not require investigation."
