  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are syntactically invariant constants or obvious constant boolean expressions, so there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale for not flagging each control statement:\n\n- In OS_BinSemFlush: the controlling expression if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) depends on return_code which is assigned from OS_ObjectIdGetById(\u2026), a function call that may return different values at runtime. Therefore the expression is not invariant.\n\n- In OS_ObjectIdGetById: the checks if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), and the final if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) all depend on return_code which is set by OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit and OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex and possibly OS_ObjectIdConvertToken \u2014 all runtime operations. None of these are compile-time constants, so the controlling expressions are not invariant.\n\n- In OS_BinSemFlush_Impl: the controlling expression if (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(&sem->id) != OS_SUCCESS) depends on the result of a function call (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex) and is therefore not invariant.\n\n- No for/while/do-while loops or if statements use a literal constant (e.g., if (1), while (0), for(;;)) as the controlling expression. The use of the macro OS_SUCCESS (0) occurs only in comparisons with variables or function returns, not as a sole constant controlling expression.\n\nGiven the above, there are no control expressions that are evidently invariant and thus nothing requiring investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code fragments."
