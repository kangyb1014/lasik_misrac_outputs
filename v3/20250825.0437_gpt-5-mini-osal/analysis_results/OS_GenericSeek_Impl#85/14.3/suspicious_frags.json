  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are compile-time or program-invariant and therefore no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specific controlling expressions and why they do not require investigation:\n\n- switch (whence): whence is a function parameter (uint32) and is not an invariant constant; the switch control expression is variable-dependent. The case labels (OS_SEEK_SET, OS_SEEK_CUR, OS_SEEK_END) are constant labels for the switch and are not themselves controlling expressions.\n\n- if (os_result == (off_t)-1): os_result is assigned from lseek(impl->fd, ...), so the condition depends on the runtime return value and is not invariant.\n\n- if (errno == ESPIPE): errno is a runtime-modified global (set by lseek), so this comparison is not invariant.\n\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) expands to an index lookup using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&tok) which reads token->obj_idx; this is runtime data, not a constant.\n\n- There are no while/for/do loops with constant controlling expressions in the function; the provided MISRA exceptions (infinite loops or specific do-while integer constant expressions) are not applicable.\n\nGiven the above, there are no controlling expressions that are invariant and therefore no code fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 14.3."
