It could and should be declared as a pointer to const (const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) and assigned the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (implicit conversion from T * to const T * is allowed).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_GenericSeek_Impl the local variable impl is declared as OS_impl_file_internal_record_t * but is only used for read access (impl->fd) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object or passed to any function expecting a mutable pointer. Therefore it can and should be declared as a pointer to const (const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) to satisfy MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro yields a non-const pointer, but implicit conversion from T * to const T * is allowed, so changing the local declaration is safe and fixes the violation."
