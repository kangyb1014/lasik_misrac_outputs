In OS_GenericSeek_Impl it is only used for read-only access (impl->fd is read to call lseek), so the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl). Therefore this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_GenericSeek_Impl the local variable impl is declared as a pointer to a non-const type (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) but is only used for read-only access (only impl->fd is read to call lseek). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible. It is safe and appropriate here to declare impl as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl. Assigning the address of a non-const array element (the macro expands to &OS_impl_filehandle_table[index]) to a pointer-to-const is allowed in C and enforces the intended read-only use within this function. Therefore the agent A's claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is correct."
