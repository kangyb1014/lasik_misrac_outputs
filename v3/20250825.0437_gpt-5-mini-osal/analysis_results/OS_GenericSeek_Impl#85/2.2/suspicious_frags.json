  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs are part of the essential runtime behavior and are not dead code: the switch/whence mapping is required to translate API values to system SEEK_* values; the lseek call and its error handling (including the ESPIPE branch) affect observable behavior and must remain; the use of impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) and subsequent impl->fd dereference are necessary to identify the file descriptor; the conversion of os_result to int32 on success yields the function result and cannot be removed without changing behavior; the default switch case returns an error and is reachable for invalid inputs. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usage, the variable declarations (where, os_result, retval, impl), and the assignments are all used on at least one execution path and therefore are not dead. No other lines in the provided function are evident as operations that are executed yet have no effect. (Note: the struct field 'selectable' is not flagged because there is no evidence in the provided code that it is executed anywhere and determining whether it is unused project-wide requires a broader codebase analysis.)"
