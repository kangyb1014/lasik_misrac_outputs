  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this implementation. Specifically:\n- 'token' is only dereferenced to read its value (used in OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET with '*token'); there is no assignment to 'token' itself nor to '*token' in this function. The parameter type (const OS_object_token_t *) enforces read-only access to the pointed object in this function.\n- 'offset' is only read and cast to off_t for the lseek call; it is not assigned to or otherwise modified.\n- 'whence' is only read in the switch statement to select 'where'; it is not assigned to or otherwise modified.\n- No other statements perform assignments to any of the function parameters. The local variables (where, os_result, retval, impl) are distinct and used appropriately.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments here that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. (The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro is used in a read-only context with '*token' as an rvalue; if there is concern about the macro's internal behavior it would need to be reviewed separately, but within this function no parameter modification occurs.)"
