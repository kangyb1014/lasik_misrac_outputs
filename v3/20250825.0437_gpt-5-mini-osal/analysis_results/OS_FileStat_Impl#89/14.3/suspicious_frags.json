  "explanation": "The listed fragments are all controlling expressions (selection directives and a preprocessor conditional) and therefore relevant to checking MISRA C Rule 14.3. Other parts of the function\u2014variable declarations, assignments (e.g. FileStats->FileSize = st.st_size; filetime assignments; readbits/writebits/execbits construction), return statements, and comments\u2014are not controlling expressions and so are not subject to Rule 14.3; they do not need to be investigated for invariance. The preprocessor feature-test #if was included because it governs which runtime code is compiled; everything else in the function is non-control code and not relevant to this rule."
