  "explanation": "For assessing the MISRA rule about pointers needing const qualification, the analyzer must know the exact types and usage that determine whether pointer parameters or referenced objects could/should be const:\n\n- os_fstat_t (type definition): Required to see which members are written (e.g. FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits). If members are modified by this function, the pointer cannot be const; the concrete definition is essential.\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE / OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: These macros are written into FileStats->FileModeBits; knowing they are simple constants and that the function mutates that field confirms non-const requirement for FileStats.\n- int stat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf) (prototype): Needed to confirm the correct const qualification of the first parameter (pathname). If stat's prototype accepts const char *, the use of const char *local_path is correct; if not, it could indicate a mismatch.\n- struct stat (definition: st_size, st_mtime, st_mtim, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid): The code reads these members; knowing their types and whether any are pointers or require non-const access is necessary to judge whether any local pointer should be const-qualified or whether the function takes non-const pointers unnecessarily.\n- struct timespec (definition: tv_sec, tv_nsec): Used to assemble FileTime; definitions ensure types are not pointer types that would trigger const qualification concerns.\n- S_ISDIR (macro): Macro inspects st_mode; its definition confirms it takes an integer (not a pointer) so no hidden pointer const rules are violated.\n- Permission macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): These are bitmasks ORed into local mode_t variables and compared against st.st_mode. Knowing they are integer constants confirms no pointer const issues there.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID (definition/type): Needed to confirm types used in equality comparisons with st.st_uid/st.st_gid (uid_t/gid_t) and to ensure those are not pointer-like or require const qualification.\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds (prototype/signature): To verify it takes scalar time components (tv_sec, tv_nsec) by value and does not require passing pointers that might need const qualifications.\n- type definitions used by struct stat: mode_t, uid_t, gid_t, time_t: Ensure that the fields read from struct stat are scalar types, not pointer types, so no hidden pointer-to-non-const issues arise.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine which pointer parameters/objects are actually modified, which are only read, and whether any pointer could reasonably be changed to point-to-const in conformance with the MISRA rule."
