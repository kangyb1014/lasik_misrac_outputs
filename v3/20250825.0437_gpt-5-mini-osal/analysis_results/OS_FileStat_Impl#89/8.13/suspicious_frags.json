  "explanation": "No pointer usages in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specific pointer occurrences and reasons they need not be investigated: \n\n- local_path is declared as const char *local_path \u2014 already const-qualified, complying with the rule.\n- FileStats is declared as os_fstat_t *FileStats and is written to (e.g., FileStats->FileSize = ...; FileStats->FileModeBits |= ...). Because the function intentionally modifies the object, the pointer must not be const; this is compliant with Rule 8.13 (the rule requires const qualification only when possible).\n- The address-of operator &st passes a struct stat * to stat(), which writes into st; stat() requires a non-const pointer, so const qualification is not possible.\n- filetime, st, and mode_t variables are non-pointer objects; there are no other pointer parameters or pointer variables that could be const-qualified.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that should be flagged for investigation under Rule 8.13."
