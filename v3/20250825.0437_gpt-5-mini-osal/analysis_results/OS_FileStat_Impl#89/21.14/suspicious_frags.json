  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_FileStat_Impl and the related symbol definitions. There are no calls to memcmp, no uses of macros or wrappers that resolve to memcmp, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The code only passes local_path to stat (no string comparison), performs integer/bitwise checks on st_mode and compares uid/gid values (integer comparisons), and assembles time values. Therefore, within the supplied code there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 to investigate. If there are other source files or macros not provided here that might call memcmp on C strings, those would need to be checked separately."
