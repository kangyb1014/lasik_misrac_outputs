  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler/language extensions (MISRA rule about language extensions), the analyzer must see the exact declarations and definitions of all platform/library symbols and feature-test macros that the function depends on. For each listed symbol: \n\n- struct stat, st.st_size, st.st_mode, st.st_mtim, st.st_mtime, st.st_uid, st.st_gid: The layout and member names of struct stat (especially st_mtim vs st_mtime) can be a platform or libc feature (exposed only with specific feature-test macros or provided as an extension). You must inspect the actual definition to decide if use of a particular member is a nonstandard extension.\n\n- struct timespec, filetime.tv_sec, filetime.tv_nsec: struct timespec is POSIX (nanosecond resolution). Verify whether it is provided by the implementation as part of the standard headers or as an extension; member names and presence affect whether code relies on nonstandard features.\n\n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE: These feature-test macros control visibility of POSIX extensions (e.g., st_mtim). The analyzer must know their values/definitions in the build environment to decide if the code is using a guarded standard feature or relying on a nonstandard extension.\n\n- stat (function): stat is a POSIX API. Confirming its prototype/availability in the target environment helps determine whether the code relies on standard or extended library APIs.\n\n- S_ISDIR and S_I* / S_IR*/S_IW*/S_IX* macros: These file-mode macros are POSIX. You must confirm they are provided by the target headers and are not compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- mode_t, uid_t, gid_t, time_t: These typedefs' definitions and ranges may be implementation-defined. Comparing these types to constants (e.g., OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID) may involve implicit conversions; the analyzer should confirm they are standard typedefs rather than compiler extensions.\n\n- os_fstat_t and its members (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits): The target function writes into this type. Knowing the exact types/definitions ensures no use of implementation-specific bitfields, nonstandard integer widths, or compiler-specific attributes.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: This callee determines the type/representation of FileTime. Its signature/definition is needed to verify no use of compiler-specific calling conventions or nonstandard types.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: These constants/macros are compared to st_uid/st_gid. Their definitions (type and how they are defined) are needed to check for use of extensions or nonportable constructs.\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: These macros are written into FileModeBits; their definitions are needed to ensure they do not rely on compiler-specific bitfield layout or extensions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: Return-status macros/enum values; need to confirm they are standard project symbols and not provided via compiler extension mechanisms.\n\nIn short: verify the actual declarations/definitions of all referenced POSIX/system types, members, feature-test macros, and OS-layer symbols to determine whether any of them are compiler or library extensions rather than standard language/library features. Without these symbols you cannot conclude whether use of e.g. st_mtim or struct timespec relies on an extension or on standardized POSIX interfaces enabled by feature-test macros."
