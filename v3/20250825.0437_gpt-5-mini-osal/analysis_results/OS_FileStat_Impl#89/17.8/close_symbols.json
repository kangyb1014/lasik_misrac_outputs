  "explanation": "For verifying the MISRA rule (function parameter shall not be modified \u2014 pointer itself must not be reassigned; object pointed-to may be modified) the next analyst needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- os_fstat_t\n  - Definition of the pointed-to type for the FileStats parameter (fields like FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits). Needed to confirm that the code is only writing members of the object pointed to (allowed) and not attempting to reassign the FileStats pointer itself.\n\n- struct stat\n  - Definition (members st_size, st_mtim/st_mtime, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid) used by the function. Required to check how st is used and to ensure no macro expansions or member accesses could alias or reassign the incoming parameters.\n\n- struct timespec\n  - Definition (tv_sec, tv_nsec) used to build filetime and passed to OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds; needed to confirm only member values are read and stored into FileStats->FileTime (allowed).\n\n- stat (the POSIX prototype actually invoked)\n  - Prototype (int stat(const char *, struct stat *)) to confirm that the call uses a const char * parameter (so stat cannot legally modify the local_path pointer or the string it points to) and that stat writes into &st only, not into any of this function's parameters.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds\n  - Declaration/behavior (parameters/return) to ensure this call does not take/modify FileStats or local_path and that its use only supplies a return value assigned to a member of *FileStats (allowed).\n\n- S_ISDIR, S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP\n  - Definitions of these macros/constants to ensure none expand to code that could assign to the function parameters (e.g., strange macro side-effects). Also to confirm they are simple bit masks/testing macros as expected.\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC\n  - Definitions of the FileModeBits constants to ensure their use only modifies the pointed-to structure's bitfield (allowed) and does not involve any hidden reassignment of the FileStats pointer.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID\n  - Definitions (types/values) used in comparisons with st.st_uid/st_gid. Needed to confirm these macros/values do not expand to operations that could alter parameters.\n\n- mode_t\n  - Type definition for the readbits/writebits/execbits variables; included to verify no unexpected macro/type tricks that could rebind parameters.\n\n- int32\n  - The function return type alias; included to ensure there is no macro/typedef that would alter parameter semantics.\n\nIn short, these symbols let the analyst confirm (1) whether any invoked functions or macros could reassign the pointer parameters (local_path, FileStats), (2) that only members of *FileStats are written (permitted), and (3) that no macro expansions hide illegal modifications of the parameter variables themselves."
