The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol:\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry (implementation and prototype): The target function calls UT_GetStubEntry. MISRA\u2019s for\u2011loop rule requires that the behaviour of any functions called from a for loop body be considered part of that body. To determine whether the target function (or any hypothetical for loop involving these calls) would violate the rule, the full implementation is needed to see if it contains for loops, modifies potential loop counters/objects, or has persistent side effects (global state changes) that would make a surrounding for loop ill\u2011formed.\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry (implementation and prototype): The target calls UT_ClearStubEntry when the returned pointer is non\u2011NULL. As above, its implementation must be inspected for any for loops, side effects, or modifications of objects that could act as loop counters or be modified inside a loop body \u2014 all relevant to judging compliance with the rule.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t (typedef): The key type passed into UT_GetStubEntry could be an integer, enum, pointer, or struct. Its exact type is required to understand what objects are being passed, how they may alias other objects, and whether any operations in called functions could modify or depend on the loop counter or other objects referenced in a for loop clause.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t (struct/typedef): The pointer returned by UT_GetStubEntry is of this type. Knowing the structure fields is necessary to determine whether UT_ClearStubEntry or other functions modify members that might be used as loop counters, or whether pointer aliasing could cause modifications to objects used in loop clauses.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT (macro/enum value): The constant passed into UT_GetStubEntry could affect control flow inside that function (e.g., selecting a code path that contains loops or side effects). Its definition is required to understand which code paths will execute and whether those paths contain for loops or modifications relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\nNotes:\n- The static call graph shows UT_GetStubEntry and UT_ClearStubEntry have no further callees in the provided graph; if their implementations call other functions not present in the graph, those callees would also need to be provided. The items above are the minimal close symbols needed to analyze whether the target function (including the behaviour of the functions it invokes) could violate the MISRA C for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness rule."
