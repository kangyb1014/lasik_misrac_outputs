  "explanation": "Only the memset call is a use of a <string.h> function that could write into an object via a pointer parameter and thus must be checked for potential out-of-bounds access. Other code fragments do not invoke the listed string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) or otherwise perform buffer writes via pointer parameters:\n- OS_UsecToTimespec performs integer arithmetic and direct assignments into the provided timespec fields, not calls to <string.h> routines.\n- timer_settime and related timer operations are POSIX timer APIs and not string handling functions.\n- The call to strerror(errno) returns a pointer to an internal/static string and does not take a user buffer pointer parameter that could be overwritten; it is not a write into a caller-supplied object and thus not relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17 as stated.\n- Other assignments (e.g., setting timebase->accuracy_usec, local->reset_flag) are simple scalar writes, not calls to string.h functions.\nTherefore only the memset invocation requires investigation under Rule 21.17."
