  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n- OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds\n  Required because it is a direct callee. To determine whether any use of <string.h> functions (e.g. memcpy/strcpy) occurs that could access out-of-bounds memory, the implementation and prototype of this function must be inspected.\n\n- OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart\n  Same rationale as above: this direct callee must be examined for any use of string.h APIs or operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_time_t (type/definition)\n  The two callee functions accept/dereference an OS_time_t value. The layout/contents of OS_time_t (e.g. embedded arrays or pointer members) are necessary to assess whether any string.h calls in the callees operate on buffers with correct bounds.\n\n- struct timespec (definition)\n  The target writes into TimeSp.tv_sec and TimeSp.tv_nsec. Knowing the exact types/sizes of these members (from struct timespec) is needed to confirm the assignments are type- and size-safe and that no hidden buffer operations occur when passing the structure to other functions (e.g. clock_settime).\n\n- clock_settime (prototype/implementation)\n  clock_settime is invoked in the target. Although standard implementations normally do not call string.h functions in a way that affects user buffers, its prototype/implementation should be checked to ensure it does not internally invoke any string handling that could result in out-of-bounds accesses related to the arguments passed by this target.\n\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK (macro/constant)\n  This macro/constant is passed to clock_settime. Knowing its value/type verifies the argument types are correct and helps determine whether any indirect behavior could lead to unsafe string operations (e.g. if it triggers a path that uses string APIs).\n\n- int32 (typedef)\n  The return type alias must be known to ensure no implicit conversions or hidden size issues could affect buffer handling or API contracts with callees.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR\n  The macros/constants used for the return value. Included for completeness so the semantic effects of the function (and any conditional paths) are clear when tracing whether any path could invoke string.h functions unsafely.\n\nNotes\n- The target function itself contains no direct calls to <string.h> functions. The MISRA rule would only be violated if one of the callees (or system functions called) contains unsafe uses of those standard string/memory functions or if the types passed lead to incorrect buffer sizes. Therefore the above callees, their implementations, and the relevant type definitions/constants are required for a complete analysis."
