  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or constructs are used (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __restrict__ as a compiler-specific token, or other vendor intrinsics).\n- No statement-expressions or GNU block expressions ({ ... }) are present.\n- No nested functions, anonymous structs/unions with compiler-only support, or zero-length arrays are used.\n- The use of 'static inline' and typedefs (int32/int64/uint32) relies on standard C features and standard integer types (stdint.h), not extensions.\n- The POSIX API usage (struct timespec, clock_settime, CLOCK_REALTIME) and doxygen-style comments are not compiler language extensions; they are library/OS interfaces or comments.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
