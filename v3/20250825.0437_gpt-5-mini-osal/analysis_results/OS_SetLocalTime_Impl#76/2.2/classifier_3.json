  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SetLocalTime_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SetLocalTime_Impl(const OS_time_t *time_struct)\n{\n    int             Status;\n    int32           ReturnCode;\n    struct timespec TimeSp;\n\n    TimeSp.tv_sec  = OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(*time_struct);\n    TimeSp.tv_nsec = OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(*time_struct);\n\n    Status = clock_settime(OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, &TimeSp);\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        ReturnCode = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ReturnCode = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return ReturnCode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SetLocalTime_Impl:\n#define OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK CLOCK_REALTIME\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\nstatic inline int64 OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(OS_time_t tm)\n{\n    return (tm.ticks / OS_TIME_TICKS_PER_SECOND);\n}\n...\nstatic inline uint32 OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(OS_time_t tm)\n{\n    return (uint32)OS_TimeGetFractionalPart(tm) * OS_TIME_TICK_RESOLUTION_NS;\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int64 ticks; /**< Ticks elapsed since reference point */\n} OS_time_t\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (Status == 0)\n{\n    ReturnCode = OS_SUCCESS;\n}\nelse\n{\n    ReturnCode = OS_ERROR;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if/else assigns ReturnCode based on the return value of clock_settime(Status). These assignments determine the function return value (OS_SUCCESS on Status==0, OS_ERROR otherwise). Removing either assignment (or the whole if/else) would change program behaviour, so the operations are not dead code. (Only if static analysis or platform guarantees made one branch impossible would either branch be considered dead, but no such guarantee is present in the provided code.)"
