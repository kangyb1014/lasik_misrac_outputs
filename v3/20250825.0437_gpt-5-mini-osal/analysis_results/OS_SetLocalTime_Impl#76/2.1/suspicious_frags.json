  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified. Reasoning:\n- The assignments to TimeSp.tv_sec and TimeSp.tv_nsec are executed unconditionally and are reachable whenever the function is called.\n- The call to clock_settime(...) is a runtime call that may succeed or fail; there is no compile-time constant that makes either branch of the subsequent if (Status == 0) conditional impossible. Both the true branch (ReturnCode = OS_SUCCESS) and the false branch (ReturnCode = OS_ERROR) are reachable at runtime depending on the return value of clock_settime.\n- There are no constant conditional expressions, no dead code after an unconditional return, no unconditional infinite loops, and no statements guarded by compile-time macros that always evaluate to false in the provided code fragment and definitions.\n- The final return ReturnCode is the intended function exit; nothing follows it that could be unreachable.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code and related macros, there is no code that appears unreachable and no fragments need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
