  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Both parameters (sock_id and Mode) are passed by value and are only read: sock_id is passed to OS_ObjectIdGetById and not assigned to, and Mode is used in checks and bitwise tests but never assigned to. All assignments in the function modify local variables or members of the object pointed to by stream (stream->stream_state), not the parameters themselves. The only pointer usage is &token (address of a local variable) passed to helper functions; this does not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 in this function."
