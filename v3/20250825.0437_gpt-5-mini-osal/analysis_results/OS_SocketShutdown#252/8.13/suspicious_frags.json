  "explanation": "No pointer variables or pointer-to-object usages in this function are suitable for const-qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer declared is:\n- \"OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\" \u2014 this pointer is used to modify the object (stream->stream_state is cleared in two places), so it must point to a mutable object and cannot be const-qualified.\nOther apparent pointer usages are addresses of local objects passed to APIs:\n- \"&token\" passed to OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_SocketShutdown_Impl, and OS_ObjectIdRelease \u2014 these APIs likely require a modifiable token (output/operation parameter), so the address cannot be to a const-qualified object.\n- \"OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token)\" returns a pointer to the internal stream table entry which is subsequently modified; therefore it cannot be const.\nNo other pointer declarations or pointer-typed function parameters appear in this snippet that could reasonably be changed to point to const-qualified types without altering program behavior. Consequently there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13 in this function."
