  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found relating to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function has a single parameter: OS_time_t *time_struct. The code does not reassign or modify the pointer variable time_struct itself (no statements like time_struct = ..., time_struct++, etc.). The only modification is to the object pointed to (*time_struct = ...), which the rule explicitly permits. All other identifiers (Status, ReturnCode, TimeSp) are local variables and clock_gettime is called with &TimeSp (a local address), not with the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 17.8."
