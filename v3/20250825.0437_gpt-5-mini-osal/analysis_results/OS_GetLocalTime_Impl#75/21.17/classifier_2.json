  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strcat, etc.). The fragment uses vsnprintf (from <stdio.h>) and then writes a terminating NUL at msg_buffer[actualsz]. The code clamps actualsz to 0..(OS_BUFFER_SIZE-1) after vsnprintf (and handles negative return), so the assignment cannot write beyond the msg_buffer bounds. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated."
