  "explanation": "Only code that performs formatting or uses C string API or buffers has potential to access beyond object bounds and therefore needs investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17. The remaining lines in OS_GetLocalTime_Impl (clock_gettime call, assignment via OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds, and the ReturnCode logic) do not call any of the <string.h> string-handling functions nor manipulate character buffers and so are not relevant to this rule. The OS_ConsoleWrite invocation simply passes the buffer for output (no string.h calls shown here). The OS_DEBUG macro is defined in the snippet (empty), but since it can be configured differently in other builds, calls that rely on formatting (shown above) were included for inspection; other statements that do not perform string/buffer operations were excluded because they cannot cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects under Rule 21.17."
