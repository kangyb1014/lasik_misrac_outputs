  "explanation": "I have reported all occurrences in the provided code that introduce controlling expressions (explicit conditionals or macro calls that typically expand to conditional checks). These are the places that could potentially be invariant and therefore need investigation under MISRA C Rule 14.3. Other fragments in the supplied code do not contain controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation for this specific rule: - The return statements and ordinary function calls (e.g. return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(...);, return return_code;) are not controlling expressions. - The inline helper OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl simply computes and returns a value (no control flow). - OS_TaskGetId_Impl only reads thread-local storage and returns a value; it contains no conditional/loop controlling expressions. - Macro definitions or constants that are used as operands (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, typedefs) by themselves are not controlling expressions. These items cannot violate Rule 14.3 directly because they do not form loop/conditional controlling expressions. If investigation of any reported macro (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_APINAME, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, BUGCHECK) shows they expand to non-conditional code or to allowed invariant usage (e.g., intentional infinite loop or permitted do-while constant-false pattern), then they would be acceptable under the rule; otherwise they should be reviewed further."
