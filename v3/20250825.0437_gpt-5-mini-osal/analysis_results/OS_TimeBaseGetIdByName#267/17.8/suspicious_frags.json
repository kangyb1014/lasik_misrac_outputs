  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function or related definitions assigns to the function parameters themselves. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameter timer_id is never reassigned inside OS_TimeBaseGetIdByName; it is only passed to OS_ObjectIdFindByName, which writes to *object_id (i.e., the object pointed to) \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8.\n- The string parameter timebase_name is declared const and is only passed by value to lookup functions; there is no modification of the pointed-to characters in the shown code.\n- The macros shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER and OS_CHECK_APINAME) expand to predicate checks and do not perform assignments to the parameter identifiers (they evaluate expressions like (ptr) != NULL or check string length). The use of BUGCHECK/ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK in the snippets is as checks, not reassignments.\n- Other related functions shown (OS_ObjectIdFindByName, OS_printf) do not reassign their pointer parameters in a way that would modify the pointer argument in the caller; OS_ObjectIdFindByName assigns via *object_id, which is allowed.\nGiven the provided code and macro expansions, there are no occurrences of modifying the pointer parameter variables themselves, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
