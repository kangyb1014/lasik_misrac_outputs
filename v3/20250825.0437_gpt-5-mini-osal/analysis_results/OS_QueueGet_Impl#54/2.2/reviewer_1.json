Immediately after this line the code unconditionally enters one of the do { sizeCopied = mq_...(...) } while(...) loops, which assign sizeCopied before any read.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The assignment sizeCopied = -1; is executed unconditionally but is overwritten on every possible control path before any use. Both branches (timeout == OS_PEND and the else branch) execute a do { sizeCopied = mq_...( ... ); } while(...); loop body at least once, so sizeCopied is always assigned by the mq_receive/mq_timedreceive call before any subsequent read (the later if (sizeCopied == -1) checks the result of those calls). Removing the initial assignment would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note also that sizeCopied is not volatile, and there are no intervening reads between the initial write and the guaranteed later writes, so there is no special case that would make the write semantically necessary."
