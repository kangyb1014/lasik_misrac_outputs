  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically checked items and rationale:\n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or builtins (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __inline__ nonstandard tokens) are present.\n- The function declared as static inline (OS_ObjectIdFromToken) uses the C99 inline feature, which is a standard language feature (not a compiler extension) unless the project targets a pre-C99 dialect \u2014 no evidence in the snippet indicates a compiler-only extension.\n- All casts and format specifier usage are standard C; the OS_DEBUG calls and use of pthread APIs (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_cond_broadcast, etc.) are POSIX library calls, not compiler language extensions and therefore outside Rule 1.2\u2019s scope as specified in your instruction.\n- Typedefs (int32 from int32_t, osal_id_t as uint32) and bitwise operations are standard C.\n- No nested functions, statement expressions, variadic macros with nonstandard behavior, or other known compiler-specific constructs were found.\n\nIf there are other files, macros, or build-specific compiler flags (or project targets a pre-C99 dialect) not shown here, those could introduce language extensions; those items would need to be reviewed to be certain. Based solely on the provided code, there are no fragments that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
