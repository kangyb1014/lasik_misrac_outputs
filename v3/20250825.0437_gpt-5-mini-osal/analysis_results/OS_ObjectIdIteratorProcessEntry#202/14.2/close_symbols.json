  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry can violate the MISRA \u2018for loop shall be well-formed\u2019 rule you must examine not only the target function but also any functions and types that affect (a) side effects performed inside the function body and (b) the contexts (call sites / iterator loops) that invoke it. The listed symbols are required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global: this is called directly by the target. You must inspect its behaviour (does it modify any objects that could be used as a for-loop counter or loop-control flag?) and whether it has persistent side effects visible to enclosing loops.\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl: the actual implementation may contain the real side effects (locks, global state changes); inspect it to determine whether those side effects could violate the rule when this function is used inside a for statement.\n- OS_Lock_Global: called directly after the handler call. As with unlock, you must know whether it modifies objects that may be used as loop counters or flags.\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl: implementation may perform modifications (e.g., change global state, update IDs); inspect to detect side effects affecting loop counters.\n- OS_ObjectIdFromToken: called to produce the osal_id_t passed to the handler. Verify it does not modify persistent state or objects that could be loop counters/flags.\n- OS_object_iter_t (struct/type): the target accesses iter->token and iter->arg. You need the struct definition to know the types and aliasing/ownership of token/arg (could they alias a loop counter or shared object modified elsewhere?).\n- osal_id_t (typedef): examine its representation to see whether passing/converting IDs could modify underlying objects or rely on objects that might be loop counters.\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: callers (e.g., CloseFileByName/CloseAllFiles) use iterator/iteration helpers. The for-loop that invokes the iterator routine may be in this function; inspect it to find the actual for-statement and identify its loop counter/flags.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: initialises the iterator used by the callers. You must see how the iterator and its loop counter/flags are set up and which objects they use (so you can check whether OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry or its callees modify those objects).\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: finaliser may modify iterator state; inspect for side effects relevant to loop control and whether only the loop counter is modified in the third clause of a for loop.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: used by callers in conjunction with the iterator; its behaviour may reveal which object(s) are used as loop counters or indexes and whether they can be modified by functions called in the loop body.\n- OS_CloseFileByName, OS_CloseAllFiles, OS_ForEachObjectOfType: these are the static callers of OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry. Inspecting them shows how the iterator is used, the actual for-loop(s) that execute the iterator body, which loop counter(s) / control flags are used, and what function pointer is passed as the handler.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: appears as a handler used by the callers. You must inspect the concrete handler(s) that are passed as func to OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry to determine whether the handler (the loop body behavior) modifies the loop counter or other objects forbidden by the MISRA rule.\n\nIn summary: inspect the unlock/lock/from-token implementations for side effects, the iterator type and iterator init/iterate/destroy functions to find the actual for-loop(s) and loop counters/flags, the callers to identify which handler functions are passed, and the handler implementations (e.g. UT_ExecuteBasicHandler) to determine whether any called function in the loop body modifies loop counters or other objects in violation of the MISRA rule."
