  "explanation": "I found no usages of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n\n- OS_MutSemGetIdByName: uses standard C (function, pointer parameters, return value) and a macro invocation (OS_CHECK_POINTER). No GCC/clang extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, nested functions, statement-expressions, typeof, or __builtin_* usage).\n- OS_printf: uses standard varargs (va_list, va_start, va_end) and the standard library function vsnprintf. No compiler extensions are present.\n- OS_ObjectIdFindByName: uses standard local variables and pointer dereference. The ARGCHECK and LENGTHCHECK tokens appear to be macros; their use here is standard macro invocation syntax and shows no extension usage.\n- Typedefs (osal_id_t, int32): these are ordinary typedefs of integer types (uint32, int32_t). Their usage is standard C.\n\nNotes/observations: if any of the macros referenced (BUGCHECK, BUGCHECK_VOID, OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) are defined elsewhere using compiler-specific extensions (for example, statement-expressions ({...}) in GCC, typeof, __attribute__, asm, or other vendor builtins), those macro definitions would need to be inspected. However, based on the source excerpts you provided, there is no evidence of language extensions in the shown code, so no fragments are flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
