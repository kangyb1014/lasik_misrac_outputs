  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not contain pointer declarations or uses that could be considered for const-qualification: - There are no other pointer parameters or local pointer variables in this function. - Scalar locals/parameters (return_code, msecs) are not pointer types. - The body contains only a call to the implementation and a return; there is no pointer arithmetic, casts, or assignments that would implicate const-qualification. - Comments and control flow are not relevant to Rule 8.13. Therefore only the pointer-bearing function signature and the pass-through call (which expose the pointer parameters) need to be investigated for possible const qualification. "
