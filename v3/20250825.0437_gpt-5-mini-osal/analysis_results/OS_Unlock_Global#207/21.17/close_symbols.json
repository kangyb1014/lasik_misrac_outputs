  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - The function calls OS_DEBUG in two places. To determine whether any string.h routines (memcpy/memset/strcpy/strlen/etc.) are invoked on pointers originating in OS_Unlock_Global, the implementation of OS_DEBUG must be inspected (it may format into internal or caller-supplied buffers or call helpers that use string.h). If OS_DEBUG uses string.h and operates on buffers passed from this function, that could cause a MISRA violation.\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl\n  - Although OS_Unlock_Global only passes a simple obj_type to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl, the callee should be checked to ensure it does not internally perform string operations on data derived from global state or any pointers that could be influenced by this function. Include its prototype/definition to be certain no string.h use occurs on pointers reachable from here.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The token parameter type definition is needed to see whether any of its members (e.g., lock_key, obj_type, lock_mode) contain pointers to character buffers or other objects that could be passed to string functions. Also confirm sizes and representations of members used in comparisons/assignments.\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t\n  - The element type of OS_objtype_state[] must be inspected to determine whether its members (owner_key, etc.) contain pointers to character arrays or other objects that might be passed to string functions. Knowing the structure fields is necessary to ensure no string.h usage could affect them.\n\n- OS_objtype_state (the global array)\n  - The global array declaration (type and size) is required to check indexing bounds (token->obj_type) and to know the actual storage layout and whether any members are pointers into external buffers that could be used with string functions.\n\n- OS_lock_key_t (type of owner_key / lock_key)\n  - The code accesses owner_key.key_value and lock_key.key_value and assigns OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID. The exact typedef/struct for these key objects is needed to rule out embedded pointers or custom copy semantics that might invoke string operations (or alias to char arrays), and to ensure assignments are simple scalar operations.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID\n  - The value assigned to owner_key and token->lock_key must be known (its type and value). If it is implemented via a macro or initializer that invokes string operations or wraps a structure containing pointers, it could introduce string.h use.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE\n  - Used in the bitmask check; its definition is required to verify it is a pure scalar constant and does not hide any string operations or pointer manipulation.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER\n  - This constant controls the branch taken (whether the function body executes or the error path). Knowing its value and type is necessary to reason about which code paths (and thus which calls to OS_DEBUG or OS_Unlock_Global_Impl) are reachable.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE\n  - Like OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, this constant controls branching based on token->lock_mode. Its definition is needed to determine which code paths are taken and whether any calls that could call string.h functions are reachable.\n\n(Collecting the above symbols and their definitions lets the next analyst determine whether any string.h functions are directly used in OS_Unlock_Global or indirectly used by callees or macros invoked here, and whether any of those uses operate on pointers/objects that originate from or are passed by this function.)"
