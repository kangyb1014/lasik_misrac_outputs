  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not involve pointer declarations or pointer-to-object usage that could be made const, so they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. Specifically:\n- The conditional expressions that read token->obj_type, token->lock_mode and owner_key.key_value only perform reads or comparisons; they do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified separately from the pointer variables listed above.\n- The OS_DEBUG calls only pass scalar values (casts of key_value) to a variadic function; these do not involve pointer-to-object declarations whose pointee could be const.\n- The call OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(token->obj_type) passes an integer value, not a pointer, so Rule 8.13 is not applicable.\n- The bitmask/comparison expressions and constant macros (e.g. OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE, OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID) are not pointer types and therefore not relevant to pointer const qualification.\n\nThe listed fragments are the only places in this function where pointer variables are declared, assigned from an address-of expression, or used to perform assignments to pointed-to objects; these are the relevant locations to inspect for possible const-qualification of pointees."
