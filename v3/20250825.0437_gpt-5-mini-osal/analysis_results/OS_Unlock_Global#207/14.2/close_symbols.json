  "explanation": "For determining compliance with the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect any for loops in the target function and in any functions/macros it calls, and you must know the concrete types and objects that could participate in loop control. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl: This is the direct callee of the target function. Any for loop in that function (or functions it calls) is part of the behaviour of OS_Unlock_Global and must be inspected for well\u2011formedness (loop counter usage, side effects, modifications in body).\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Often a macro; it could expand to arbitrary code (including loops) or have side effects that would matter if used inside a for statement in this function or in callees. You must inspect its definition.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (type): The target reads token->obj_type, token->lock_mode and token->lock_key. The exact types (e.g., integer, enum, struct) determine whether these objects could be used as loop counters/control flags in called code or could be modified in a loop body (violating the rule).\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t (type): The target indexes into the OS_objtype_state array and accesses objtype->owner_key. The struct layout may include arrays or fields that are used as loop counters in other functions; knowing the type is necessary to track which objects may be used/modified by loops.\n\n- OS_objtype_state (global array/object): The actual global object that is indexed (OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]) must be inspected to see if other code (including callees) uses its elements as loop counters or modifies them in loop bodies.\n\n- owner_key / lock_key type and member key_value: The code tests and assigns .key_value fields. You need the precise type of these members (integer width, signed/unsigned) and whether these objects are used elsewhere as loop counters or loop control flags in called code; also to check whether assignments here could violate the \u2018\u2018only one loop counter\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018no modification in body\u2019\u2019 clauses if those fields are used in loops.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The actual definition/value (likely a macro/const initializer) is assigned to owner_key/lock_key. Its definition could involve expressions or macros that contain side effects or references to other objects that might be loop counters; inspect to ensure no hidden loop\u2011relevant behaviour.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE: Used in the comparison against owner_key.key_value. Its definition determines if the comparison involves only simple values (safe) or more complex expressions/macros that could hide side effects relevant to loop\u2011clause rules.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: Used in the conditional. Knowing whether this is an enum/constant or macro determines whether lock_mode might be used as a Boolean loop control flag in other code, or whether its type could be qualified in ways that matter for MISRA analysis.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: The constant used to gate the unlock logic; its definition and type are needed to determine the ranges/indices used on OS_objtype_state and whether those indices or related objects appear as loop counters elsewhere.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementation of direct callees/macros that the function invokes (OS_Unlock_Global_Impl, OS_DEBUG) for any for statements, and inspect the concrete types and definitions for the token, objtype, key objects and macros/constants used here to determine whether any loop counter/control objects are introduced, used or modified in violation of the MISRA rule."
