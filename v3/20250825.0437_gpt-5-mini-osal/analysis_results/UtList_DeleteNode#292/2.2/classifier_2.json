Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_DeleteNode:\n```c\nvoid UtList_DeleteNode(UtListNode_t *DeleteNode)\n{\n    UtList_Extract(DeleteNode);\n\n    /* non-data/header nodes shouldn't be free()'ed */\n    if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL)\n    {\n        free(DeleteNode);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtList_DeleteNode:\nvoid UtList_Extract(UtListNode_t *ExistingNode)\n{\n    ExistingNode->Next->Prev = ExistingNode->Prev;\n    ExistingNode->Prev->Next = ExistingNode->Next;\n    ExistingNode->Next       = ExistingNode;\n    ExistingNode->Prev       = ExistingNode;\n}\n...\nvoid UtList_Reset(UtListNode_t *TagHead)\n{\n    while (!UtList_IsEmpty(TagHead))\n    {\n        UtList_DeleteNode(TagHead->Next);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n    free(ListHead);\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nExistingNode->Prev       = ExistingNode;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment ExistingNode->Prev = ExistingNode is not dead code. UtList_Extract is used to remove a node from a doubly-linked list and then make the extracted node a self-referential singleton. In some usage paths (e.g. when DeleteNode->Data == NULL or when an extracted node is not immediately freed), the node must retain Prev==node to avoid leaving stale links and to indicate a standalone node; removing this assignment would change program behaviour in those cases. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
