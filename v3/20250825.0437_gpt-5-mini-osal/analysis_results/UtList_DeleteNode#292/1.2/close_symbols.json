  "explanation": "To determine if UtList_DeleteNode uses any compiler language extensions you must examine the declarations/definitions that the function depends on and any preprocessor or header-level decorations that could inject extensions: \n\n- UtListNode_t (type/struct definition): required to check whether the node type uses compiler extensions (e.g. zero-length arrays, GCC flexible/zero-length array extensions, anonymous structs/unions, packed/aligned/other __attribute__ annotations, compiler-specific bit-field behavior). Such extensions can appear in the type layout even though the target function source looks ordinary.\n\n- UtList_Extract (declaration/definition): required because the callee's declaration or definition may employ compiler extensions (attributes, calling-convention pragmas, inline/asm extensions or nonstandard keywords) that affect how the call appears in this translation unit.\n\n- free (prototype / stdlib.h): required to verify that the free symbol used is the standard declaration and not a nonstandard macro or function alias that uses extensions or compiler-specific attributes.\n\n- NULL (macro definition): required to confirm the macro expansion (some compilers/headers implement NULL in nonstandard ways) and to ensure no extension is being used via the NULL definition.\n\n- Translation-unit headers / preprocessor macros and pragmas that affect these symbols (the header(s) that declare UtListNode_t/UtList_Extract and any macros that expand the function signature): required because compiler-specific pragmas, macros or attributes applied at the header or compilation-unit level (for example #pragma, #define wrappers that inject __attribute__ or inline assembly) can make otherwise-conforming code rely on language extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the type and the relevant declarations/headers) lets the analyzer detect any use of compiler-specific keywords, attributes, pragmas, or nonstandard extensions that would violate the MISRA rule on language extensions."
