  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided fragment. The snippet only uses standard ISO C constructs: a normal function definition, pointer member access (DeleteNode->Data), conditional (if), the NULL macro, and the standard library free() call. There are no compiler-specific tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof (as a GCC extension), Microsoft-specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions. Any other symbols referenced (UtList_Extract, UtListNode_t) are not defined in the given fragment; based solely on this code there is no evidence of language extensions to report."
