  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function deletes and frees the node: it calls UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) (which presumably modifies the node/list links) and later calls free(DeleteNode). Because the function modifies and deallocates the pointed-to object, the pointer cannot be const-qualified. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
