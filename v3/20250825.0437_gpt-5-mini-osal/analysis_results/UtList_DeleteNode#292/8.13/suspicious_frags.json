  ],
  "explanation": "The provided function body contains only the declarations and uses of the DeleteNode pointer and its Data member; there are no other pointer variables or pointer expressions in the snippet to consider. The listed fragments cover: the function parameter declaration (the pointer type as declared), the call that passes that pointer to another routine, the read access to the node's Data member, and the call to free the node. No other code fragments exist in the snippet that could be relevant to Rule 8.13 (there are no additional pointer declarations, casts, assignments to pointer targets, or other pointer-typed expressions). Therefore no other fragments need investigation based on the available code."
