  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (struct definition): Needed to know the type of DeleteNode and the type of its Data member. MISRA const-qualification analysis requires knowing whether members or the whole node are modified; the struct definition shows whether Data is a pointer-to-const already and which fields might be modified by called functions or by free.\n- UtList_Extract (declaration and/or definition): The target function passes DeleteNode to UtList_Extract. To decide if DeleteNode could be declared as a pointer-to-const, we must know whether UtList_Extract modifies the node (its prototype and/or body show whether it takes a non-const UtListNode_t* and whether it mutates fields). If UtList_Extract modifies the node, DeleteNode cannot be const.\n- UtList_Reset (declaration and/or definition): UtList_Reset is a caller of UtList_DeleteNode (per the call graph). The caller's prototype and usage indicate what qualification it expects and what it passes; this affects whether changing DeleteNode to const would be compatible with its callers.\n- UtList_Destroy (declaration and/or definition): UtList_Destroy calls UtList_Reset (call chain shown). Its prototypes/usages may reveal higher-level ownership semantics and whether nodes are expected to be modifiable or freed, which bears on whether pointers should be const.\n- free (prototype from <stdlib.h>): The function calls free(DeleteNode). free expects a void* (non-const). If DeleteNode were const-qualified, passing it to free would require casting away const \u2014 not allowed by MISRA. The free prototype is needed to determine whether freeing the object forces the pointer to be non-const.\n- Header that declares UtList_DeleteNode (e.g., utlist.h): The external declaration (header) shows the public API signature and required qualifications. To decide whether the implementation should use a const-qualified pointer we must ensure any change would be consistent with the declared prototype and public usage.\n(Extra: if available, include any node-creation/ownership functions to clarify who owns/frees nodes \u2014 ownership affects whether the delete function legitimately modifies/frees the object.)"
