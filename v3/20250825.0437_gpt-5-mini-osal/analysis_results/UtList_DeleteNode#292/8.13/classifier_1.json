  "scenario": "The expression alone does not show a declaration. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (they should be to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified). The fragment if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL) merely checks for NULL and does not itself require const. A violation would occur only if the member UtListNode_t::Data is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. void * or T *) even though the list never modifies the pointee; in that case Data should be declared as const void * or const T * and Rule 8.13 would be violated."
