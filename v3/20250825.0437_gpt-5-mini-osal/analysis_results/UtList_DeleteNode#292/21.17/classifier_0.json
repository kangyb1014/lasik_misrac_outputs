  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the single call UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) alone because this fragment does not invoke any <string.h> functions. The call itself does not violate Rule 21.17. A violation would occur only if the implementation of UtList_Extract uses string.h functions incorrectly \u2014 for example, doing memcpy(DeleteNode->Data, src, n) with n greater than the destination object size, strcpy(DeleteNode->Data, src) where src is longer than the destination buffer, or calling strlen on a non-terminated buffer so that the function reads past the object bounds. In such implementation cases Rule 21.17 would be violated."
