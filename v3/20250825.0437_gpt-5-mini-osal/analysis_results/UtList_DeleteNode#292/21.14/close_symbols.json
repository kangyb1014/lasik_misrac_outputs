  "explanation": "UtList_Extract: This function is called directly by UtList_DeleteNode; its body must be inspected to see if it (or functions it calls) uses memcmp to compare strings. UtListNode_t: The struct/type definition is needed to know the type of the Data member (e.g. char * or other) so you can determine whether any memcmp usage would be comparing null-terminated strings. UtList_Reset: Caller of UtList_DeleteNode \u2014 include to check wider call context and to find any related code paths that might perform memcmp on nodes or node->Data before/after deletion. UtList_Destroy: Calls UtList_Reset (caller-of-caller); include to cover the full reachable call chain from external APIs that might use memcmp on node data. memcmp: The standard-library symbol itself \u2014 search for direct or wrapper uses of memcmp in the above functions (or files) to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation being checked)."
