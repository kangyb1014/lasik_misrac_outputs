  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are constant/invariant literals. The only conditional is\n    if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL)\nwhich is a run-time expression dependent on the incoming pointer and therefore not an invariant constant. There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The call to UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) is not a controlling expression. The provided Rule 14.3 exceptions (infinite loops and the specific do-while case) do not apply. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. (Note: potential issues such as a NULL DeleteNode dereference are outside the scope of Rule 14.3 and are not flagged here.)"
