  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. UtList_DeleteNode calls only UtList_Extract and free; UtList_Extract (provided) does not call UtList_DeleteNode or any other function that would call back, so there is neither direct nor indirect recursion. There are no other function calls, function pointers, or callbacks in the provided code that could cause an indirect self-call. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
