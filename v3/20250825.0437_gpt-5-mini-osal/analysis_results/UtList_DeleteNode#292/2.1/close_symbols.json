  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: required to know the exact layout and semantics of the node (the Data field type, whether Data can be NULL, whether there are other sentinel/header fields). Determining whether the if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL) branch can ever be taken (or is unreachable) depends on the struct definition and any implicit invariants on its members.\n- UtList_Extract: this callee may modify DeleteNode or its Data field, or may free the node itself. To decide if the free(DeleteNode) statement is reachable (or if the code after Extract is unreachable/undefined), we must inspect UtList_Extract's implementation or contract.\n- UtList_Reset: a direct caller of UtList_DeleteNode. Its implementation is needed to determine what kinds of nodes it passes (header vs data nodes) and whether it can pass NULL, which affects reachability of the free() call and the conditional.\n- UtList_Destroy: a caller of UtList_Reset (in the call chain). Inspecting it may be necessary to see all call contexts that could make the conditional unreachable (e.g., if Reset/Destroy only ever pass header nodes).\n- node allocation/initialization routines (e.g. UtList_CreateNode, UtList_Init): the way nodes are created/initialized determines whether Data is ever non-NULL for allocated nodes, or whether some nodes are statically allocated/non-heap so free(DeleteNode) would never be executed or would be invalid. These routines are needed to tell whether any code path can produce a node that makes the if-body reachable.\n- header-node/data-node invariants/macros/documentation: any macros, constants or comments that establish that header nodes always have Data==NULL or that certain nodes must not be freed are needed to prove that the free(DeleteNode) branch is impossible (unreachable) or conversely that it can be reached.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyzer determine whether the conditional and free() call are ever reachable on any call path (and whether code following UtList_Extract is reachable at all), which is necessary to assess a violation of the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
