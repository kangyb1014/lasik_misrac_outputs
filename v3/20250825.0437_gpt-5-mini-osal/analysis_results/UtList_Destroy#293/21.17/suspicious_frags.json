  "explanation": "This function contains no direct calls to any <string.h> routines, so only operations that can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when such routines are called elsewhere need inspection. The declaration of the loop index (uint32 i;) and the function signature are ordinary and do not involve string handling. The only locations that could cause string functions (possibly called inside UtList_Reset) to access memory out of bounds are the places where the ListHead pointer is dereferenced and the Tags array is indexed (these have been reported). The final free() releases the ListHead object but is not itself a string operation; it has been included for completeness in case callers use ListHead after free or if UtList_Reset depends on ListHead lifetime. No other lines in the function perform string handling or pointer/array operations relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so they do not require further investigation."
