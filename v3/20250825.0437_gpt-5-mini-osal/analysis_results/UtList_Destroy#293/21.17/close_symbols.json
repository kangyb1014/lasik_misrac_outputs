  "explanation": "- UtList_Reset (function definition): UtList_Destroy calls UtList_Reset for each tag. To determine whether any string handling function is invoked on the tag object (and might access out-of-bounds memory), we must inspect UtList_Reset's body for uses of memcpy/strcpy/etc. and how it indexes or sizes buffers.  \n- UtList_DeleteNode (function definition): The static call graph shows UtList_Reset calls UtList_DeleteNode. Any string/memory operations that could overflow may be inside UtList_DeleteNode, so its implementation must be examined.  \n- UtListHead_t (complete struct/type definition): UtList_Destroy indexes ListHead->NumberOfTags and ListHead->Tags[]. The struct layout is needed to know Types, sizes and whether Tags references point to buffers or nested structures that string functions might operate on.  \n- Type/definition of ListHead->Tags[] element (tag record type, e.g., UtListTag_t or struct tag): If the tag structure contains character arrays or pointers to buffers, their sizes and ownership determine whether string functions used on them could exceed bounds.  \n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by UtList_Reset or UtList_DeleteNode that perform string/memory operations (bodies/prototypes of functions that call memcpy, memmove, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, memcmp, etc.): The MISRA rule targets uses of standard <string.h> functions. Even if UtList_Destroy itself doesn't call them, they may be used in its callees. You must include the implementations of any such functions to check argument lengths, buffer sizes, and indexing.  \n- Definitions of any macros/constants that determine tag buffer sizes or NumberOfTags semantics (e.g., compile-time size of Tags[], max counts): Bounds checks depend on how NumberOfTags is maintained and the allocated size of Tags[]. If Tags[] is a flexible array or allocated dynamically, the allocation size and any related macros/constants are required to verify that the loop and subsequent operations do not lead to out-of-bounds string operations."
