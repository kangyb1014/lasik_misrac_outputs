  "scenario": "The code fragment UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]); does not itself call any functions from <string.h>, so it does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation could occur only if UtList_Reset internally uses string.h routines (e.g. memcpy/strcpy) and the pointer passed is out-of-bounds \u2014 for example if ListHead->NumberOfTags is larger than the actually allocated length of the Tags array (or the ListHead/Tags object is otherwise corrupted), so &ListHead->Tags[i] refers beyond the array and is then dereferenced by a string function. In the absence of such internal string.h usage or an out-of-bounds index, the fragment does not violate Rule 21.17."
