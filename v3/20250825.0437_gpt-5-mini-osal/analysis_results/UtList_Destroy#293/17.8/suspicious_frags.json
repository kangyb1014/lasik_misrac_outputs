  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is ListHead (a pointer). The code only (a) dereferences ListHead to read NumberOfTags and to index Tags, (b) passes the address of an element (&ListHead->Tags[i]) to UtList_Reset (this may modify the object pointed to by ListHead, which is allowed by the rule), and (c) calls free(ListHead) (which releases the object referred to by the pointer but does not modify the pointer variable itself). There is no assignment to ListHead, no pointer arithmetic on ListHead, and no reassigning of the parameter variable. Therefore none of the shown fragments appear to violate Rule 17.8. If further assurance is required, inspect UtList_Reset to confirm it does not attempt to modify the pointer parameter variable passed to it (internally reassigning a parameter is local and does not affect the caller, but review may be needed for consistency with the rule inside that function)."
