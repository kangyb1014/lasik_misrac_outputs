  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer declarations and usages in the provided fragments: the parameter UtListHead_t *ListHead in UtList_Destroy, the member UtListNode_t *Tags in UtListHead_t, the parameter UtListNode_t *TagHead in UtList_Reset, and the parameter UtListNode_t *DeleteNode in UtList_DeleteNode. Rule 8.13 recommends adding const to the pointed-to type when the pointee is not modified through the pointer. In these fragments the pointees are modified or deallocated: UtList_Destroy calls free(ListHead); UtList_Reset deletes nodes via UtList_DeleteNode; and UtList_DeleteNode may call free(DeleteNode) and inspects/modifies DeleteNode->Data. Because these operations modify and/or free the objects pointed to, the pointers cannot be safely qualified as pointers to const. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that should be flagged for missing const qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If additional related code (other functions that only read through these pointers) exists elsewhere, those should be rechecked, but nothing in the supplied code is a violation."
