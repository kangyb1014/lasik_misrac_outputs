There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C \"for loop shall be well-formed\" requirements we must know whether the loop control expressions use or are affected by objects modified in the loop body or by called functions. Concretely:\n\n- UtListHead_t (struct definition): needed to see the layout and relation between the loop counter expression and the data being iterated; the second clause uses ListHead->NumberOfTags and the loop body indexes ListHead->Tags \u2014 the struct definition shows whether these are independent objects or if there are aliases/pointers between them.\n\n- UtListHead_t::NumberOfTags (field declaration and type): the loop continuation condition uses ListHead->NumberOfTags. MISRA requires the second clause not use objects that are modified in the loop body. We must know the exact type and whether any called function (UtList_Reset/UtList_DeleteNode) can modify this field.\n\n- UtListHead_t::Tags (field declaration and element type): the loop body passes &ListHead->Tags[i] to UtList_Reset. We need to know the element type and any back-pointers from a tag element to the parent ListHead (or shared state) that would allow UtList_Reset to modify NumberOfTags or other objects used in the loop clause.\n\n- Type of Tags[i] (the tag/node type passed to UtList_Reset): UtList_Reset takes a pointer to a tag/node; the tag type definition reveals if Reset can reach back (via pointers embedded in the tag) to modify ListHead or other objects used in the loop clauses.\n\n- uint32 (typedef/underlying type): the loop counter i is declared uint32. MISRA constrains loop counters; we must confirm uint32 is an integer type (signedness/width) and that no aliasing allows external modification of i (functions cannot legally modify a local unless passed its address).\n\n- UtList_Reset (prototype and full body/implementation): MISRA counts the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body. We must examine Reset to determine whether it modifies the loop counter, ListHead->NumberOfTags, ListHead->Tags, or any other object used in the for second/third clause, or whether it has persistent side effects relevant to the loop condition.\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode (prototype and full body/implementation): Reset calls DeleteNode. Any modification performed by DeleteNode (for example decrementing NumberOfTags, re-linking Tags, freeing memory, changing global flags) affects whether the for loop\u2019s second/third clauses are valid under MISRA. We must inspect DeleteNode's effects as part of Reset's behaviour.\n\n- Any global objects or external state referenced or modified by UtList_Reset/UtList_DeleteNode: if these functions modify global state that is also used in the for condition or increment, that can violate the rule that the second clause must not use objects modified in the loop body or that only the loop counter is modified by the third clause. Because we do not know the names a priori, the analysis must include every global/extern the called functions touch.\n\nThese symbols (definitions and implementations/prototypes) provide the necessary information to determine whether objects used in the for loop clauses are modified inside the loop body (directly or via called functions), whether there are persistent side-effects in the second clause, and whether the loop counter is the only object modified by the loop increment \u2014 all required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
