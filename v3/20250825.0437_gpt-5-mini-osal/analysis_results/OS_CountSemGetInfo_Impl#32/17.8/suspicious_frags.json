  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not modify the pointer parameters themselves and therefore do not raise a Rule 17.8 concern. Specifically: sem_getvalue(&impl->id, &sval) only passes the address of an internal semaphore and a local int (no parameter pointer reassignment). The assignment count_prop->value = sval modifies the object pointed to by count_prop (which is permitted by the rule). There are no statements that reassign the parameter variables token or count_prop. The listed fragments are the locations that require inspection to ensure the pointer parameter is not being modified (macro use and the macro definition that takes the address of its token argument, the function signature, the global table used, and the helper that accepts a token pointer)."
