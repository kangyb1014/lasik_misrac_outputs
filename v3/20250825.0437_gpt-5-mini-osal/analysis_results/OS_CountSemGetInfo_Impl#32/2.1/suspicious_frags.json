  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- There are no statements after an unconditional return; the only early return is inside the if (sem_getvalue(...) < 0) branch, which is a conditional runtime path. The final return is reachable when sem_getvalue succeeds. Both paths are reachable at runtime depending on the return value of sem_getvalue.\n- There are no constant conditions (e.g. if (0) or if (1)) or compile-time constructs in the shown code that would make any statement unreachable.\n- Declarations are used and there are no dead labels, unreachable case labels, or code after an unconditional jump in the shown fragment.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET was not provided; based on the visible code it is used as an expression to obtain impl. There is no evidence in the provided snippet that the macro expands to something that would introduce unreachable code. If the macro expansion were available and contained unconditional control flow (return/goto), that could change the analysis; but with the given code no such unreachable fragments are present.\n\nNote: Potential runtime issues (e.g. null pointers, invalid token) or undefined behavior are outside Rule 2.1\u2019s \"unreachable code\" scope and therefore not flagged here."
