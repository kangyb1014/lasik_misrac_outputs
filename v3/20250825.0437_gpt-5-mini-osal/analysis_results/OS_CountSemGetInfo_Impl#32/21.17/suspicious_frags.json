  "explanation": "I found no uses of any functions from <string.h> (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code. The function OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl only: 1) retrieves an entry from an object table via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, 2) calls sem_getvalue with a semaphore id and an int pointer, and 3) assigns an integer value into count_prop->value. None of these operations invoke or imply use of string handling routines or buffer manipulations covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The provided additional symbol (OS_impl_count_sem_table array) is an array of semaphore records and does not indicate any string buffer operations. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for Rule 21.17."
