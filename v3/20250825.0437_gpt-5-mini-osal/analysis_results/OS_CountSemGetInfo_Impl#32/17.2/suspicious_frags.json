  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl does not call itself, and none of the functions/macros it uses can lead back to it: sem_getvalue is a POSIX/system call and cannot call application functions; OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro that expands to an address computation using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (a simple inline accessor) and does not call OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl; OS_impl_count_sem_table is just an array of records; the public wrapper OS_CountSemGetInfo calls OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl but there is no reverse call from OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl to the wrapper; there are no function pointers, callbacks, or other indirections in the shown code that could create indirect recursion. Therefore there is no direct or indirect self-call to investigate for Rule 17.2."
