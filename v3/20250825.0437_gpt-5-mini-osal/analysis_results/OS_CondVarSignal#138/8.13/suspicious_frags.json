  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);",
    "return_code = OS_CondVarSignal_Impl(&token);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not involve pointer-to-object conversions or usages that could be qualified as pointing-to-const: the parameter var_id is passed by value (no pointer), the local variables (OS_object_token_t token; int32 return_code;) are plain objects (not pointers), the return statement and the status check logic do not create pointers that could/should be const-qualified. The only pointer usages in this fragment are the address-of operator on the local token when calling the two functions above, so no other lines require investigation under Rule 8.13."
