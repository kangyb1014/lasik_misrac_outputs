  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments in the provided function or the related definitions that constitute dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Rationale:\n\n- The local variable \"local\" is used to obtain the mount point (local->system_mountpt) passed to statvfs; removing the lookup/assignment would change behavior.\n- The statvfs() call is a runtime operation that affects program behavior (and the function returns OS_ERROR on failure). It is not removable.\n- The struct statvfs stat_buf is used to hold the results from statvfs and is subsequently read to populate the OS_statvfs_t result; those assignments are observable behavior.\n- The assignments to result->block_size, result->blocks_free, and result->total_blocks are necessary to deliver the function result to the caller; removing them would change behavior.\n- The OSAL_*_C macros used are compile-time casts and not runtime operations; they do not introduce dead executable operations.\n- The wrapper OS_FileSysStatVolume performs parameter checks and token lookup/release; these are necessary and executed in normal flow.\n- There is no unreachable code shown in the snippets; every executable statement in the shown path contributes to observable behavior.\n\nBecause every executed operation in the provided code affects the program's observable behavior (either by interacting with the OS via statvfs, by producing outputs written to the caller-supplied result, or by managing object tokens), there are no candidates that should be flagged as dead code for further MISRA Rule 2.2 investigation."
