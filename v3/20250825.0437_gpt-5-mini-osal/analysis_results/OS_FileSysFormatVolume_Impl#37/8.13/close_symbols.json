  "explanation": "1) Definition of OS_object_token_t: The const in the parameter const OS_object_token_t *token applies to the type OS_object_token_t. If OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer typedef (or has internal pointer members) the meaning of the const differs (e.g., const on a typedef-to-pointer does not make the pointed-to object const). To determine whether the parameter is correctly const-qualified per MISRA, you must inspect the exact typedef/struct.\n\n2) Definitions of any nested types/members used inside OS_object_token_t: If OS_object_token_t is a struct containing pointers or other typedefs, those nested types determine whether additional const qualifiers are required on the pointed-to subobjects. MISRA\u2019s guidance about pointing to const \"whenever possible\" can require inspecting the contained types to decide if deeper const qualification is appropriate.\n\n3) Function prototype/declaration of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (header): The external declaration (in headers) can differ in qualifiers from the implementation; you must confirm the public prototype matches the implementation\u2019s const usage and that there is no mismatch that would defeat the intended const-correctness.\n\n4) Implementation of OS_FileSys_Initialize (caller): To understand whether making the parameter const is appropriate in practice, inspect how callers create and pass the token (e.g., whether they expect the callee to modify the underlying object). While the target function is a no-op today, caller usage can reveal whether const qualification is safe/meaningful and whether changing qualifiers would cause caller-side issues."
