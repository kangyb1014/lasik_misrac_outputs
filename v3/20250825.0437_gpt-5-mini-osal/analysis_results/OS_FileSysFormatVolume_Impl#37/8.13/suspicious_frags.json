  "explanation": "I examined the function signature and body and the related typedef. The only pointer in the provided code is the parameter declaration: 'const OS_object_token_t *token', which already points to a const-qualified type and therefore complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer declarations, pointer casts, or implicit pointer uses in the function body or in the provided typedef ('typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t') that would warrant investigation for missing const qualification. Consequently, there are no suspicious code fragments to report."
