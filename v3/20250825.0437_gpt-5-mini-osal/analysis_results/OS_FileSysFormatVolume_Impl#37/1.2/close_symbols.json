  "explanation": "1) int32: The function return type is written as \"int32\" which is not a standard C keyword. To determine if this is a standard typedef (e.g. typedef int32_t int32;) or a compiler-specific language extension/type, the typedef/definition of int32 must be inspected.  \n2) OS_SUCCESS: The function returns the macro/constant OS_SUCCESS. Its definition could expand to an expression that uses compiler extensions (builtins, __extension__, asm, attributes, exotic integer widths, etc.). Inspecting the OS_SUCCESS definition ensures the return expression does not use language extensions.  \n3) OS_object_token_t: The parameter type may itself be a typedef, struct, or macro that uses compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, typeof, statement-expressions, builtins, incomplete-array tricks, or other nonstandard constructs). The type definition must be checked to rule out extensions.  \n4) OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (declaration/prototype): The function\u2019s declaration in headers or any macro that wraps the function name may include annotations/attribute macros (for example, macros expanding to __attribute__((...)), __declspec, or other compiler-specific qualifiers). Inspecting the prototype/header ensures no extensions are injected via declaration macros or pragmas."
