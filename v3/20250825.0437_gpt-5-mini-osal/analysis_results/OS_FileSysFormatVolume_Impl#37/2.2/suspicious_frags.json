  "explanation": "The two fragments above are explicit no-op implementations that are callable from the surrounding code (OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is invoked when should_format is true; OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl is invoked when formatting fails). They represent executed operations that perform no observable action and thus should be investigated for potential dead code.\n\nOther code fragments in the provided files were not included because they perform observable effects or necessary checks and therefore are not dead by the Rule 2.2 definition: for example, OS_FileSys_Initialize performs parameter validation, object allocation, state updates, and flag setting; OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl determines filesystem type, finds and validates a mount directory, and constructs local->system_mountpt; OS_mkfs and OS_initfs adapt historic error codes; the call sites that invoke the no-op functions are part of control flow but their other operations have effects (setting flags, starting volumes, allocating tokens). Macros and type definitions (e.g. OS_SUCCESS, OS_object_token_t) are not executable code and do not constitute dead code. No other functions in the supplied code are pure no-ops or appear to execute operations whose removal would be behaviorally inert."
