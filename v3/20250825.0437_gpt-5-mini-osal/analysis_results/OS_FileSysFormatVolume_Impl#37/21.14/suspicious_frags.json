  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl contains only comments and a single return statement (return OS_SUCCESS;). There are no calls to memcmp, no other Standard Library string/comparison functions, and no operations on null-terminated strings in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
