  "explanation": "1) OS_SUCCESS \u2014 The function returns this symbol. To be certain the function contains no hidden controlling expressions (e.g. if OS_SUCCESS were a macro that expanded to code with conditional/loop constructs), the analyzer must see its definition and confirm it is a simple integer constant or expression without control flow.  \n2) OS_object_token_t \u2014 The parameter type must be inspected only to rule out any strange macro/type tricks (for example, if the parameter were a macro that expands into code containing control statements). Verifying its typedef/definition ensures the function signature does not hide any controlling expressions.  \n\nNote: The target function body contains no if/while/for/switch/do constructs; thus, absent unusual macro expansions of the above symbols, there are no controlling expressions to evaluate for the MISRA rule."
