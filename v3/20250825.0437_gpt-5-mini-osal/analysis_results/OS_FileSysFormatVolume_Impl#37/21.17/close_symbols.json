  "explanation": "Only two symbols are needed to be certain the target function contains no use of string.h routines.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function body returns this symbol. If OS_SUCCESS is a macro or enum that expands to or invokes other code (for example, a macro that calls a function or expands to an expression that uses string routines), that could introduce uses of string.h functions. Confirming the definition ensures the return is a simple constant and not a hidden call to memcpy/strcpy/etc.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The single parameter's type should be checked to ensure it is a plain typedef/struct and not a macro that expands to something that causes implicit code generation (e.g., function-like macros, inline initialization, or attributes that expand to helper calls that might use string functions). While a plain type cannot by itself invoke string functions, some projects use macros in type position; verifying the definition rules out hidden string.h usage.\n\nNo other callees or globals appear in the target function, so symbols such as callers or unrelated functions are not required for determining compliance with the string-handling bounds rule for this function."
