  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is declared as a pointer-to-const (const OS_object_token_t *token) and the function body contains no statements \u2014 it immediately returns OS_SUCCESS. There are no assignments, reassignments, casts, or function calls that could modify the pointer parameter itself or the object it points to. The related definitions provided (typedef of OS_object_token_t and OS_SUCCESS macro) do not introduce any modifications. Hence there is nothing in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
