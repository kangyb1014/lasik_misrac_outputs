  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code fragments: OS_CondVarWait, OS_ObjectIdGetById, and OS_CondVarWait_Impl (and the related macros/typedefs). I found no unreachable code constructs that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Reasons:\n\n- OS_CondVarWait: The function calls OS_ObjectIdGetById and then conditionally calls OS_CondVarWait_Impl only if return_code == OS_SUCCESS. Both branches are reachable depending on the return value; there is no code after the final return that is bypassed or rendered unreachable by a prior unconditional return.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Control flow uses conditional returns and an if block based on return_code; each return is reachable depending on outcomes of the called routines. The OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel call is executed when return_code != OS_SUCCESS (including failure from OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex or OS_ObjectIdConvertToken), which is a reachable error-handling path. No statements are located after unconditional returns such that they would be dead.\n\n- OS_CondVarWait_Impl: The pthread_cleanup_push/pthread_cleanup_pop pair is present and surrounds the pthread_cond_wait call as required. The code following pthread_cleanup_pop (the status check and subsequent return) is reachable. There are no constant-condition branches or code placed after an unconditional return that would be unreachable.\n\n- Macros/typedefs: The provided #define and typedef fragments are simple constants/types and do not introduce unreachable code.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that appear to be unreachable. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the supplied code."
