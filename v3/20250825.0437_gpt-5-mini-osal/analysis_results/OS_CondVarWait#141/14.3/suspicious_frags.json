  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Specifically:\n\n- The if statements (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)) all test variables (return_code) which are assigned from function calls, so their values are not constant/invariant at compile time.\n\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById uses constant macro arguments, but that is a function call, not a controlling expression; the result is stored in return_code and subsequently tested at runtime.\n\n- OS_CondVarWait_Impl uses pthread_cond_wait and then tests the returned status (if (status != 0)), which is a runtime result and not invariant.\n\n- The literal false passed to pthread_cleanup_pop is an argument to a function-like macro and not a language-level controlling expression (if/while/for/do-while). Rule 14.3 targets controlling expressions (conditions of selection/iteration statements); passing a constant argument to a cleanup macro does not violate the intent of the rule in this context.\n\n- There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant controlling expressions in the provided fragments. The exception clauses for infinite loops or a do-while with a constant false do not apply because such constructs are not present.\n\nTherefore no code fragments require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 based on the supplied code."
