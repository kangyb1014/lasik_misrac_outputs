  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for-statement constructs in the supplied target function or in any of the additional code fragments. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops (their three clauses and loop-counter usage). Since there are no 'for (...)' statements present, there are no direct code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 14.2.\n\nDetailed reasoning:\n- The body of OS_TaskFindIdBySystemData contains no for loops; it only performs parameter checks, calls validation and lookup helper functions, and returns.\n- The provided implementations (OS_TaskValidateSystemData_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_TaskIdMatchSystemData_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease) likewise contain no for statements.\n- Macro usages in the shown code (e.g., OS_CHECK_POINTER / BUGCHECK) as provided do not expand to any visible for loop here.\n\nNotes for completeness / caveats (not flagged as suspicious fragments because their definitions were not provided):\n- Some called routines and macros referenced here are only shown by name (for example, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, and the BUGCHECK macro definition is elided). If those unseen definitions contain for loops, those implementations must be inspected against Rule 14.2. Because their bodies are not part of the provided code, they cannot be marked here as suspicious fragments \u2014 they should be reviewed separately.\n\nConclusion: No code fragments in the supplied code violate or need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 because there are no for loops present. If you want, I can review additional source files or the full expansions of the omitted macros/functions to check for any for-statements there."
