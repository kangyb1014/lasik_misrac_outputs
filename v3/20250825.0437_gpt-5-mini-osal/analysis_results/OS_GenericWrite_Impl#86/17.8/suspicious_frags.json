  "explanation": "All other code in OS_GenericWrite_Impl only reads the function parameters (token, buffer, nbytes, timeout) or assigns to local variables (return_code, os_result, operation, impl) and thus does not itself modify the parameter variables. There are no direct assignments to any of the parameters (no statements like token = ..., buffer = ..., nbytes = ..., or timeout = ...). The listed fragments are the only places where the parameters are used in ways that could mask or enable modification of a parameter (macro address-of usage, passing the token to another routine, and use of a macro that may cast away const on buffer). Those usages therefore should be investigated further to confirm the pointer itself is not being modified and that any casts do not violate the rule. No other fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 based on the provided code."
