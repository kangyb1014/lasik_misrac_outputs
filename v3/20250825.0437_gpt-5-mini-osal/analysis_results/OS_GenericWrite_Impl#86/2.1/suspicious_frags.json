  "explanation": "Fragments not reported do not show evidence of being statically unreachable. Declarations and the final return statement are normal and reachable in at least one control-flow path. The assignment return_code = OS_SUCCESS and the initial variable declarations cannot by themselves produce unreachable code. Comment lines and the closing return return_code; are not unreachable-code issues. The fragments listed above are those control-flow points that could be impossible to execute depending on configuration/constants or macro behavior (for example: the table lookup/macros used to obtain impl, the nbytes conditional, the selectable/OS_SelectSingle call, the writable-bit test, the write() call, and the os_result branches). These should be investigated to determine whether any of them are in fact impossible to reach (e.g. due to constant definitions, incorrect macro expansions, or invariants elsewhere in the project). Other code in the function is straightforward and does not present an apparent unreachable-code concern."
