  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. All conditional statements (e.g. if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)) depend on the variable return_code which is assigned by function calls, so the expressions are not constant. There are no loops in the provided code (no for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions. The use of constants/macros (OS_SUCCESS, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR) occurs only as operands in comparisons or as arguments, and those comparisons include a non-constant variable, so they do not violate Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no fragments requiring further investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
