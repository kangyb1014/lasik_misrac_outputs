  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function parameter var_id is a scalar (typedef uint32) passed by value and is never assigned to or otherwise modified within OS_CondVarBroadcast (no '=' to var_id, no increment/decrement, no address-of operator &var_id). The only pointer used is &token, but token is a local variable; passing its address may allow the callee to modify the object referred to (which is permitted by the rule) but does not modify any parameter of OS_CondVarBroadcast itself. The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById passes var_id by value (not by address), so the callee cannot modify the caller's var_id. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
