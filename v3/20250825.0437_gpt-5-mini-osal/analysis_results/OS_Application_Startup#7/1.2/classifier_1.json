  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment 'int32 Status;' uses an identifier 'int32' which, in the absence of compiler documentation, should be treated as a typedef/alias rather than a language extension. MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is only violated if 'int32' is a compiler-provided non-standard type/keyword explicitly documented as an extension (e.g. a compiler built-in type named 'int32'). There is no evidence of such an extension in the provided code, so the rule is not violated."
