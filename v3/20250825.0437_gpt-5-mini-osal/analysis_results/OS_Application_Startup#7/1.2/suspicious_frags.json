  "explanation": "Other code fragments in this function use standard C constructs and do not by themselves indicate compiler language extensions: the function definition and parameter list (void), the assignment and function call syntax (Status = OS_API_Init();), the if statement and comparison (if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)), the cast to (int) and the string literal/format specifier, and the call to OS_ApplicationExit(Status) are all standard C usage. No use of inline assembly, GCC/Clang attributes, nonstandard keywords, or other obvious compiler-specific constructs appears elsewhere in the shown code. The two reported fragments should be investigated because they may hide nonstandard elements (a project-specific typedef named int32 or a macro BSP_DEBUG that could rely on compiler-specific variadic-macro or attribute extensions)."
