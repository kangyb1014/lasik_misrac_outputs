  "explanation": "All other branches and statements in the provided code are reachable in normal control flow and therefore do not warrant investigation for Rule 2.1. The initial error-return paths in OS_ObjectIdGetById (returning immediately on failure) are explicit and reachable when the called routines fail. The conditional in OS_close that gates the close/finalize sequence is a normal runtime branch. The logging path inside OS_GenericClose_Impl (when close() returns < 0) is also reachable at runtime. The remaining statements in OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete (setting final_id to OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED on success, calling OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, and the success-only OS_NotifyEvent call) are executed by the normal success path. Therefore no other code fragments appear to be statically unreachable and need investigation for Rule 2.1."
