  "explanation": "I scanned the provided code for compiler-specific language extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, GCC/clang builtins, or other nonstandard keywords). None of those appear explicitly in the visible code or declarations. The remaining constructs are ordinary C (typedefs, function calls, pointer/struct access, return statements, macros used in a standard way). The three reported fragments are macro or callback invocations that could potentially expand to or wrap compiler-specific extensions (macros often hide compiler-specific constructs such as attributes, builtin functions, statement-expressions, or other extensions). These macro usages should be investigated by inspecting their definitions to ensure they do not rely on compiler-specific language extensions. All other code lines in the snippets provided do not show signs of using compiler extensions and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the visible code."
