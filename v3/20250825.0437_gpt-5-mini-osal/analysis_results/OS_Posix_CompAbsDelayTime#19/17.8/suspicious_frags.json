  "explanation": "Only the statements that write through the pointer parameter tm (the clock_gettime call which initializes the object, and the subsequent modifications of tm->tv_sec and tm->tv_nsec) need to be inspected for compliance with Rule 17.8. There are no assignments to the pointer variable tm itself (no statements like tm = ...), and the non-pointer parameter msecs is not modified anywhere, so other lines/statements in the function do not raise concerns under Rule 17.8."
