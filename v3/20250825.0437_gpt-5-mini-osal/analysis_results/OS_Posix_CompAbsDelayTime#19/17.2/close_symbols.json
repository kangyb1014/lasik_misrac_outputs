  "explanation": "OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl: Direct caller of OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime (present in the static call graph). Its body must be inspected to see whether it (or functions it calls) call back to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, which would create indirect recursion.\n\nOS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl: Direct caller of OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime. Must be checked for any call paths that lead back to the target function.\n\nOS_QueueGet_Impl: Direct caller of OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime. Its implementation and its callees must be examined for paths returning to the target.\n\nOS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: A callee of OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl (per the call graph). It needs to be analyzed because it could contain calls that eventually lead back to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, forming an indirect cycle.\n\nOS_ObjectIndexFromToken: A callee of OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl and OS_QueueGet_Impl. Include to check whether it (or functions it calls) can create a call cycle back to the target.\n\nOS_BinSemTimedWait: Public/wrapper caller of OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl. Include wrapper-level callers because call cycles may traverse through higher-level APIs; the wrappers must be inspected if they participate in any indirect recursion involving the target.\n\nOS_CountSemTimedWait: Public/wrapper caller of OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl. Included for the same reason as above.\n\nOS_QueueGet: Public/wrapper caller of OS_QueueGet_Impl. Included because wrapper-level call chains may be part of an indirect recursive cycle.\n\nIn summary: to determine whether OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime participates in direct or indirect recursion (MISRA rule), all direct callers and the callers' callees (and the public wrappers that call the impls) must be inspected to find any path that returns to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime."
