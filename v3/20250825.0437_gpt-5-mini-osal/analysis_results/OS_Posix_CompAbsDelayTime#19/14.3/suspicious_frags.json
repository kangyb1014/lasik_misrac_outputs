  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (loops/conditionals) that are invariant. In the provided function there are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) and only one conditional controlling expression. Other statements (function call to clock_gettime, assignments and arithmetic) are not controlling expressions and therefore do not fall under Rule 14.3. There is no do-while with an essentially Boolean constant nor any obvious infinite-loop intent that would invoke the stated exceptions. Consequently, no other fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3."
