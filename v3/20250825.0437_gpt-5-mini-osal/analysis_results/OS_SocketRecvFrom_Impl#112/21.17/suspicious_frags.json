  "explanation": "I found no calls to the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided function. The only string-related usage is strerror(errno) inside OS_DEBUG(\"recvfrom: %s\\n\", strerror(errno)); strerror takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal static string\u2014it does not take a pointer parameter that could lead to out-of-bounds access as described by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The recvfrom call uses buffer and buflen, but recvfrom is a socket API (not a <string.h> function) and so is outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The macro call impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is present but no string.h functions are invoked in the visible expansion. Therefore, there are no code fragments here that directly violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
