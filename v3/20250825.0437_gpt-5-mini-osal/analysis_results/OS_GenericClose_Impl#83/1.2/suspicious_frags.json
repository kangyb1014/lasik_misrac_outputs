  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_... intrinsics, typeof, __asm__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The macros used (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_DEBUG variadic macro) are standard preprocessor constructs; variadic macros are part of standard C (C99 and later) and their use is not a compiler extension.\n- The use of static inline for OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the bool member in the struct, typedefs, extern array, and pointer/address expressions (e.g. &(*token)) are standard C features.\n- Calls to library/POSIX functions (close, strerror, errno) are API/library usages, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
