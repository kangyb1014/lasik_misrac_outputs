  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the provided related definitions for any use of the standard library function memcmp or any apparent use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. No occurrences were found in the function body, in the macros shown (OS_DEBUG, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), or in the small inline helper (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken). The only C standard/POSIX library calls present are close() and strerror(), neither of which is memcmp nor used to compare strings. There are also no explicit string comparison operations (e.g., strcmp, strncmp, or memcmp) in the supplied code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the provided snippets."
