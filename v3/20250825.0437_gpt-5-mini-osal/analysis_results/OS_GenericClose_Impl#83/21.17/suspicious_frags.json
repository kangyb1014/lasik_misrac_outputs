  "explanation": "The only use of a standard-string-library function in the provided code is the call to strerror inside the OS_DEBUG call. No other calls to <string.h> functions (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the target function or related definitions shown. The other statements (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...), result = close(impl->fd); impl->fd = -1; return OS_SUCCESS;) do not invoke string.h functions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken macro usage involves integer indexing and pointer arithmetic for object lookup, not string operations, so it does not need investigation under this rule. If the OS_DEBUG macro is disabled (as shown), the strerror call is not evaluated at runtime, but the call site should still be inspected because enabling/logging variants could re-enable the string usage."
