  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this use: the macro yields a pointer to a mutable table element (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *) which is intentionally modified (impl->fd = -1). OS_ObjectIndexFromToken() accepts a const OS_object_token_t * and the macro passes the address of the token expression, so the token-to-index call preserves const-correctness. A potential violation would exist if the macro were used only for read-only access (then it should yield a pointer to a const-qualified element or the table should be const), but in the shown code the pointer must be non-const, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not violated."
