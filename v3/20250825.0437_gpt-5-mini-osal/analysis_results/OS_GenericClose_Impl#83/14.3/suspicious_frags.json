  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant, so there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Detailed reasoning:\n\n- The only explicit controlling expression in the function body is: if (result < 0)\n  - This expression depends on 'result', which is assigned from the return value of close(impl->fd). The return value of close() is determined at run time and is not a compile-time constant, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- There are no loops (for, while, do-while) in the function body to examine for invariant controlling expressions. The allowed exceptions in the rule (infinite loops and the specific do-while constant-false case) do not apply because no such constructs exist here.\n\n- The macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token) expands to use OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)). OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is an inline function returning token->obj_idx, which is runtime data derived from the passed token; thus the index expression is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- Assignments (impl->fd = -1) and the call to OS_DEBUG are not controlling expressions and are irrelevant to Rule 14.3.\n\nBecause every controlling expression present depends on runtime values (close() return or token->obj_idx), none are invariant, and therefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
