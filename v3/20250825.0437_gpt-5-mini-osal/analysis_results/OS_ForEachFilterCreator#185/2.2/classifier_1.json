  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\n```c\nbool OS_ForEachFilterCreator(void *ref, const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj)\n{\n    OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref;\n\n    /*\n     * Check if the obj_id is both valid and matches\n     * the specified creator_id\n     */\n    return (OS_ObjectIdIsValid(obj->active_id) && (OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) ||\n                                                   OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id)));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdIsValid(osal_id_t object_id)\n{\n    osal_objtype_t objtype = OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(object_id);\n    return (objtype > OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED && objtype < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER);\n}\n...\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdEqual(osal_id_t object_id1, osal_id_t object_id2)\n{\n    return (OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id1) == OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id2));\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    osal_id_t        creator_id;\n    OS_ArgCallback_t user_callback;\n    void *           user_arg;\n} OS_creator_filter_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_common_record OS_common_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdEqual(osal_id_t object_id1, osal_id_t object_id2)\n{\n    return (OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id1) == OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id2));\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function simply returns the result of comparing the integer representations of the two IDs; every operation (both calls to OS_ObjectIdToInteger and the comparison) contributes to the returned value, so removing any of them would change behaviour. Therefore this code is not dead. (If OS_ObjectIdToInteger had undocumented side effects then removal could change behaviour, but there is no evidence of that here.)"
