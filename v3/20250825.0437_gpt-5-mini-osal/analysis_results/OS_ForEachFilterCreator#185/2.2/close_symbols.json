  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: The target calls this function. To decide if removing OS_ForEachFilterCreator changes program behaviour we must know whether OS_ObjectIdIsValid has side effects (modifies globals, performs I/O, asserts, or evaluates its argument multiple times). If it has side effects, the call is not removable and the function would not be dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual: Same reasoning as above. Its implementation or macro expansion could have side effects or evaluate its arguments multiple times. Knowing its semantics is necessary to judge whether the call inside the predicate is removable.\n\n- OS_creator_filter_t: The predicate reads filter->creator_id. The structure definition is needed to confirm that accessing this member has no hidden side effects (for example, if the member is a function-like macro or if the type has unusual semantics) and to confirm the type of creator_id for interaction with OS_ObjectIdEqual.\n\n- OS_common_record_t: The function dereferences obj->active_id and obj->creator. The record definition is needed to ensure those fields exist and to check whether reading them could have side effects (e.g., volatile-qualified members, bit-field semantics, accessor macros) or special semantics that affect removability.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: Present in the signature (unused in the body). The token type and any conventions around callbacks may affect whether the function is referenced/required (for API callback compatibility) and whether removing it would affect behavior through side-channel uses.\n\n- OS_object_id_t (typedef used for active_id/creator): The concrete ID type is relevant to understand how equality/validity functions behave and whether comparisons involve hidden side effects or expensive operations whose removal would change timing/behaviour.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY: The constant appears in the conditional. Its value/semantics (e.g., a special sentinel that changes control flow elsewhere) must be known to reason whether the conditional is meaningful or could be optimized away without semantic impact.\n\n- All references/call sites of OS_ForEachFilterCreator (any direct callers or places taking its address): To decide if the function is dead we must know whether it is ever called or its address taken (registered as a callback). If there are no references anywhere, it may be dead; if its address is passed to an iterator or stored for later use, it is live. The full set of call sites/registrations is therefore essential.\n\n- Iteration/registration routines that may invoke this predicate (any OS_*ForEach or iterator APIs that accept this signature): The function name suggests use as a predicate for an iteration API. Identifying the iterator/registration functions (and their semantics, e.g., whether they are used at runtime, their calling frequency and timing) is required to determine whether removing the predicate would alter program behaviour (including timing-related behaviour, which the MISRA note highlights).\n\nIn summary, we need the implementations/macros for the two callees to rule out side effects, the data-type definitions and constant to confirm field accesses and comparisons are ordinary reads, and the set of usages/callers (including iterator APIs) to establish whether the function is ever used at runtime. Without these symbols/locations we cannot conclude whether OS_ForEachFilterCreator is dead code."
