  "explanation": "- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: This function is directly called by OS_ForEachFilterCreator. To prove the target does not (directly or indirectly) call itself you must inspect OS_ObjectIdIsValid's implementation (and its transitive callees) to ensure it does not call OS_ForEachFilterCreator or any function that leads back to it.\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual: This function is also directly called by OS_ForEachFilterCreator. Its implementation (and any functions it calls) must be checked to ensure there is no path back to OS_ForEachFilterCreator (i.e., no indirect recursion).\n\nNo additional callees are listed for these two functions in the provided static call graph, so inspecting their bodies (and confirming their transitive callee lists are empty or do not include OS_ForEachFilterCreator) is sufficient to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
