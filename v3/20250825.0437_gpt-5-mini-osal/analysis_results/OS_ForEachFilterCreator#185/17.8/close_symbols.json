  "explanation": "OS_creator_filter_t: needed to see the type and const-qualification of filter->creator_id (and confirm that assigning ref to a local pointer does not write to the parameter variable). OS_common_record_t: needed to inspect types and const-qualification of obj->active_id and obj->creator to determine whether accesses are reads (allowed) or could imply writes. OS_object_id_t: the underlying type of active_id/creator/creator_id (or whatever ID type is used) to know if these are scalar/value types or pointers that might be modified by called functions. OS_object_token_t: to confirm the type and const-qualification of the unused token parameter (to ensure no hidden modification requirements). OS_ObjectIdIsValid (prototype): to determine how its parameter is passed (by value or by pointer) and whether the call could modify any object referred to by the function parameters. OS_ObjectIdEqual (prototype): same reason \u2014 its signature/semantics determine whether calling it can modify the objects pointed to by obj or ref. OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY: to know its type and value (ensures the comparison is a pure value comparison and has no side effects). These symbols let an analyst verify whether the function ever modifies the pointer parameters themselves (ref, token, obj) as required by the MISRA rule, and whether any called routine or member access could cause modification of the parameter variables or their pointees."
