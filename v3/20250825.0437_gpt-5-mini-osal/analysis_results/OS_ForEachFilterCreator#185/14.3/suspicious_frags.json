  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (if, while, for, do-while, switch) are present in the provided code fragments. The only conditional-like code is the boolean return expression in OS_ForEachFilterCreator, which composes calls to OS_ObjectIdIsValid and OS_ObjectIdEqual; these functions compute their results from input parameters (object_id, creator_id) and are therefore not invariant. The helper functions shown (OS_ObjectIdIsValid and OS_ObjectIdEqual) return values derived from their arguments (via OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl and OS_ObjectIdToInteger), so their results are not constant at compile time. The macro OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY is a constant, but its use is within a value comparison, not as a controlling expression for a loop or branch. Consequently, there are no invariant controlling expressions to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
