  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must examine where memcmp could be used and what is being compared: \n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: its implementation may call memcmp (or other string ops). You need to inspect it to see whether memcmp is used and on what types. \n- OS_ObjectIdEqual: most likely location for an equality comparison between IDs; must inspect its implementation to see if it uses memcmp to compare identifiers and whether those identifiers are null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the rule). \n- OS_common_record_t: declaration/definition is required to know the exact type of obj->active_id and obj->creator (are these string buffers, fixed-length arrays, structs, or integer IDs?). That determines whether memcmp usage would be comparing null\u2011terminated strings. \n- OS_creator_filter_t: declaration/definition is required to know the exact type of filter->creator_id (same reasoning as above). \n- OS_object_id_t: the typedef (or underlying type) used for object IDs; needed to determine whether ID comparisons are operating on null\u2011terminated char arrays or on fixed\u2011size binary identifiers suitable for memcmp. \n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY: definition/value of this constant is needed to understand how OS_ObjectIdEqual is used here (e.g., if it is a special sentinel string or integer). That affects whether comparisons involve strings. \n- memcmp: include the symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect uses of memcmp in the above functions and determine if it is being applied to null\u2011terminated strings (the essence of the MISRA rule check)."
