  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the expression calls OS_ObjectIdEqual with object identifier values; it does not invoke any <string.h> string-handling function (memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc.), so Rule 21.17 is not applicable. (Only if OS_ObjectIdEqual\u2019s implementation internally used string functions that read past buffer bounds would a violation occur, but that cannot be determined from this fragment.)"
