  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment performs a simple conversion from void* to OS_creator_filter_t* and does not call any <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). Rule 21.17 concerns accesses caused by those functions, so it is not applicable here. (Note: if ref does not actually point to a valid OS_creator_filter_t object other rules may be relevant, but not Rule 21.17.)"
