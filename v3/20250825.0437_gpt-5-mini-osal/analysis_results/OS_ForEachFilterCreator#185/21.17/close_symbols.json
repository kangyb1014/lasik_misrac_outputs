  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule checking about use of <string.h> functions and out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses you must examine any functions and data types the target calls or accesses:\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (implementation): The target calls this function. You must inspect its body to see if it uses any string.h functions (memcmp/strcmp/strlen/etc.) or performs memory accesses on object id fields that could go out of bounds.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (implementation): The target calls this function to compare IDs. Its implementation needs review to determine whether it uses string/memory functions (e.g., memcmp, strlen) or performs pointer/array accesses that could exceed object bounds when comparing IDs or constants like OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY.\n\n- OS_common_record_t (struct/typedef): The function reads obj->active_id and obj->creator. You need the exact field types and layout to know whether these are scalars, arrays, or pointers and whether any comparisons or copies inside callee functions could access beyond their bounds.\n\n- OS_creator_filter_t (struct/typedef): The function reads filter->creator_id. Knowing its type/layout is required to determine if comparisons/copies operate on arrays/pointers and whether such operations could overrun memory.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (struct/typedef): Although not used in the body, providing the token type completes the type context and ensures no hidden macros/attributes affect calling conventions or field aliases that could influence accesses.\n\n- OS_object_id_t (typedef for active_id/creator/creator_id): The underlying typedef (name used by the project for object IDs) is required to understand representation (integer, struct, pointer, fixed-size array) so you can judge whether any string/memory functions used in ID helpers might read/write beyond valid bounds.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY (macro/constant): The comparison uses this constant. You must know its type and value/representation (e.g., special ID, string, array) to determine whether OS_ObjectIdEqual or other code could perform string/memory operations involving this constant that might cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\nProviding the implementations and type definitions above lets the analyzer determine whether any string.h function calls occur in the called helpers or whether comparisons/copies could index past allocated object bounds."
