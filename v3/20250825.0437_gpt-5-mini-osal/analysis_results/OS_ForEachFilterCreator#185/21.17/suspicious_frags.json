  "explanation": "The function body contains no direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) nor any direct manipulation of character buffers or lengths. Simple pointer cast and field accesses (the assignment of ref to filter and uses of obj->active_id and obj->creator) do not by themselves involve the standard string handling functions covered by Rule 21.17. The only places that could possibly invoke string.h functions are the called helper functions OS_ObjectIdIsValid and OS_ObjectIdEqual; therefore those calls are listed above for investigation. All other fragments in this snippet do not involve string.h usage and need not be investigated for Rule 21.17 compliance."
