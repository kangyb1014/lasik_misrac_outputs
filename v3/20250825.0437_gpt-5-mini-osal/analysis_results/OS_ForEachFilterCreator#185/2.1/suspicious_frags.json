  "explanation": "The function contains only an initialization and a single return statement whose result is formed from nested Boolean subexpressions using short-circuit operators. There is no code after the return, no conditional compilation, no labeled blocks or multiple branches that would introduce statically unreachable statements beyond the listed expression parts. Therefore only the assignment and the subexpressions making up the return expression need investigation for potential reachability issues (e.g. whether some subexpressions can never be evaluated due to short-circuiting or due to always-true/always-false conditions). All other parts of the snippet (comments, function header, braces) do not contain unreachable code and do not need further investigation."
