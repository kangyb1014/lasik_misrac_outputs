  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given code as written. The call OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id) is part of a runtime-evaluated logical expression and will be executed whenever obj->active_id is valid and OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) evaluates to false. Short-circuit evaluation does not make this code unreachable. A concrete violation scenario would be if OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) can be determined at compile time to be always true (for example, if filter->creator_id is a compile-time constant equal to OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY or the comparison is folded to a constant true); in that case the second operand would be statically unreachable and Rule 2.1 would be violated."
