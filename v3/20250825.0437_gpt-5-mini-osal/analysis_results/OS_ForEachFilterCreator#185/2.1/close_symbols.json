  "explanation": "- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (implementation/macro): You must know whether this is a compile\u2011time constant, a macro or a function and what inputs can make it always true/false. If it is always false (or always true) for all possible obj->active_id values, the entire RHS (the inner ||) can become unreachable due to short\u2011circuiting of &&. Its implementation reveals whether evaluation can be constant and whether it has side effects.\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (implementation/macro): The semantics/implementation determine whether comparisons involving filter->creator_id or obj->creator are constant or simplified by the preprocessor/optimizer. If one of the OS_ObjectIdEqual calls always yields the same result for all inputs, a branch of the || (or the whole ||) may be statically unreachable.\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY (macro/constant definition): The value of this constant (and how OS_ObjectIdEqual treats it) is required to know whether the B operand (filter->creator_id == OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) can ever be true or is always true/false; this affects reachability of the other || operand.\n- OS_creator_filter_t (type/structure definition): You need the structure layout to know the type and possible range/constraints of filter->creator_id (and whether filter can be NULL), which affects whether the B operand can vary and thus whether code is reachable.\n- OS_common_record_t (type/structure definition): Needed to know the types and possible ranges/constraints of obj->active_id and obj->creator (and whether obj can be NULL). These affect whether OS_ObjectIdIsValid or the second OS_ObjectIdEqual can ever be true, and thus whether parts of the expression are unreachable.\n- OS_object_id_t (typedef / representation of object IDs): The underlying representation (integer type, special reserved values) and any invariants are necessary to decide if identity/validity tests are effectively constant, which is key to proving reachability/unreachability of subexpressions.\n\nCollecting the exact implementations/definitions above (including the header(s) where they are defined) lets a static reviewer determine whether any subexpression is deterministically constant and therefore whether parts of the expression are unreachable (violating the MISRA unreachable\u2011code rule)."
