  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The assignment \"OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref;\" is reached and the variable is subsequently used in the return expression (filter->creator_id), so there is no unreachable code. A concrete violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 would occur if the assignment were placed after an unconditional return (e.g. \"return ...; OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref;\"), or if it resided inside a block that can never be executed (e.g. inside \"if (0) { ... }\"), making the statement impossible to reach."
