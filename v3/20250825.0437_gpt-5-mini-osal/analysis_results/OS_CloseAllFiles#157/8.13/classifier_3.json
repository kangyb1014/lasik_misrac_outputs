  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not show a violation. However, a violation would occur if the function OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. OS_object_iter_t *iter) but does not modify the iterator; in that case the parameter should be declared as const OS_object_iter_t *iter and Rule 8.13 would be violated in the function declaration (not in this call site). With only the call site available, there is insufficient information to prove a violation."
