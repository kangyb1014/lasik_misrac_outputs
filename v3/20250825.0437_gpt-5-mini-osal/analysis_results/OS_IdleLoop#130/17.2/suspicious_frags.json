  "explanation": "No direct self-calls are present in the provided fragments. OS_IdleLoop calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl, and the shown definition of OS_IdleLoop_Impl only calls the system function sigsuspend \u2014 there is no call back to OS_IdleLoop, so that pair does not form recursion. The other provided UT_* functions (UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_GetStubEntry, UT_SetHandlerFunction, UT_DefaultStubImpl) as shown do not call themselves or form a call cycle among the visible implementations. The only call sites that invoke functions whose implementations are not provided in the snippets (and therefore could potentially introduce indirect recursion) are the two listed above: UT_DoSetHookFunction and UT_DefaultStubImplWithArgs. These missing implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not call back (directly or indirectly) into the caller chain, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. All other fragments were examined and shown (from the provided code) not to participate in recursive calls."
