  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_IdleLoop:\n```c\nvoid OS_IdleLoop()\n{\n    /*\n     * Wait until the shutdown value is set to the shutdown number\n     * In most \"real\" embedded systems, this will never happen.\n     * However it will happen in debugging situations (CTRL+C, etc).\n     */\n    while (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        OS_IdleLoop_Impl();\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_IdleLoop:\nOS_SharedGlobalVars_t OS_SharedGlobalVars = {\n    .GlobalState     = 0,\n    .PrintfEnabled   = false,\n    .MicroSecPerTick = 0, /* invalid, _must_ be set by implementation init */\n    .TicksPerSecond  = 0, /* invalid, _must_ be set by implementation init */\n    .EventHandler    = NULL,\n#if defined(OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PRINTF)\n    .DebugLevel = 1,\n#endif\n}\n...\n#define OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER 0xABADC0DE\n...\nvoid OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)\n{\n    /*\n     * Unblock signals and wait for something to occur\n     *\n     * Note - \"NormalSigMask\" was calculated during task init to be the original signal mask\n     * of the process PLUS all \"RT\" signals.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment to OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState and the call to OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() are both observable: the GlobalState value is tested by OS_IdleLoop() and the Impl hook is expected to wake the idle task. Removing either could change program behaviour. (Hypothetical violating scenario: if OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() always performs process termination or itself sets GlobalState to OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER and the assignment here is never relied upon, then the assignment would be dead code.)"
