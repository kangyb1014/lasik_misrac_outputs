  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER is not invariant \u2014 it depends on the global variable GlobalState which can be changed (e.g. OS_ApplicationShutdown sets it to OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER). Even if in normal operation the value rarely changes (resulting in an effectively infinite loop), that is an intended runtime behavior and the MISRA exception for intentional infinite loops would apply."
