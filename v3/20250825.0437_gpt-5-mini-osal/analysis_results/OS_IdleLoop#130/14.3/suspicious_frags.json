  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the provided code are dependent on runtime values or parameters and so are not syntactically invariant: - The if in UT_ExecuteBasicHandler uses the result of UT_GetStubEntry(...) and DefaultHandler (runtime) and thus is not invariant. - The if in OS_ApplicationShutdown depends on the parameter 'flag'. - The if in OS_ApplicationExit depends on the parameter 'Status'. - There are no do-while loops or other constant controlling expressions in the supplied fragments. Therefore these other fragments do not need investigation under Rule 14.3. The listed while loop should be inspected to confirm it is not an unintended invariant controlling expression (or that it legitimately implements an infinite wait/shutdown-check pattern and that concurrent updates to GlobalState are visible to the loop)."
