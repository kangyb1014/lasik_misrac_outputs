  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The only conditional is:\n\nif (pthread_equal(pthread_self(), impl->id) == 0)\n\nThis expression depends on the runtime values returned by pthread_self() and the impl->id looked up via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET using the function parameter token, so it is not a compile-time or program invariant. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions in the snippet. The macro and helper (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) use the runtime token parameter, so the table lookup is dynamic. The return values (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR) are constants but are not used as controlling expressions. Therefore no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C Rule 14.3 are present."
