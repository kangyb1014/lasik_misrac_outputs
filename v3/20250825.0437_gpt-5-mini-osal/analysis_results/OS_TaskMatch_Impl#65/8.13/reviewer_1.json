True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'impl' is declared as OS_impl_task_internal_record_t * but is only used for read access (reading impl->id). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type: e.g. declare as 'const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl'. The assignment 'impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);' therefore violates the rule because the pointer is not const-qualified although it could be.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskMatch_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_t id;\n} OS_impl_task_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_task_internal_record_t OS_impl_task_table[OS_MAX_TASKS]\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The local pointer 'impl' is only used to read impl->id and is never used to modify the pointed object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type when possible. Assigning the address of a non-const array element (the macro yields an OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *) to a pointer-to-const is allowed, so declaring\n\n    const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n\nwould both be legal and satisfy the rule. There is no macro or type constraint here that prevents adding the const qualification, so Agent A's report is correct."
