  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function do not perform any assignment to the function parameter token nor do they cast away its const-qualifier or otherwise rebind the pointer itself. The calls to pthread_equal(pthread_self(), impl->id), the returns, and the use of impl do not modify the parameter token (they only read from the object table or compare thread IDs). The only places that could lead to modification of the parameter or the object it denotes are the function signature (how token is declared), the use of *token as the macro argument, and the macro definition which takes the address of the macro argument and passes it to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken \u2014 these need inspection to ensure no write or const-discarding modification occurs. No other fragments in the provided code require investigation for Rule 17.8."
