  "explanation": "No suspicious code fragments: The rule concerns pointer types that should be const-qualified when possible. In the provided code there are no pointer declarations, pointer parameters, pointer returns, or expressions taking addresses. The function parameter (Status) is an int32 (scalar), exit is called with integer constants (EXIT_SUCCESS / EXIT_FAILURE), and the related definitions (typedef int32_t int32 and #define OS_SUCCESS (0)) do not introduce pointer usage. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this code."
