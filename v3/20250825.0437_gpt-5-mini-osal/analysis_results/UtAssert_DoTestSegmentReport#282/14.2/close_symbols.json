Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'well-formed for' analysis of UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport:\n\n- UtAssert_TestCounter_t: defines the structure/array (CaseCount) accessed by the function. Necessary to confirm that indexing expressions are simple/non\u2011modifying and to know whether any member access has side effects.\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_* (ABORT, WARN, FLOW, DEBUG, N/A, INFO, END, PASS, FAILURE, MIR, TSF, TTF): the integer constants/macros used to index CaseCount and passed as case-type arguments. Needed to verify that the index expressions are pure (no hidden side effects) and to determine whether any of these symbols are macros that could expand to expressions with side effects that would affect loop-clause rules.\n- snprintf: called twice in the function. Although a library call, its implementation could contain for loops; MISRA treats behavior of functions called from within a for loop as part of the loop body. Provide snprintf to inspect whether it contains for loops that would influence compliance if called inside a for loop (or if snprintf implementation has side effects relevant to loop counters/objects).\n- UT_BSP_DoText: the function called to emit the ReportBuffer lines. Must be inspected because any for loops or modifications to objects inside it count toward the behavior of a for loop in the caller (per the rule). Also its argument types/side effects matter.\n- UT_BSP_Lock / UT_BSP_Unlock: UT_BSP_DoText callers (locking/unlocking). Must be checked for loops or modifications to global objects (loop counters, flags) that could violate the rule when considered part of a caller's for loop body.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: one of UT_BSP_DoText's callees that may perform output; must be inspected for for-loops and side effects on objects used by any enclosing for loop in the caller.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: called by UT_BSP_DoText; include to check for loops or persistent side effects affecting loop-counter rules.\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: included because UT_BSP_DoText may call shutdown paths; check for for-loops or modifications of global state used as loop control.\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: helper called by UT_BSP_DoText per the static graph; include because it could contain loops or modify objects that would count as part of a caller's for-loop body.\n\nIn short: include the type and all index constants used directly in the function to ensure indexing is side\u2011effect free, include snprintf because it is called inside the function, and include UT_BSP_DoText and its direct callees because the MISRA rule counts behavior of called functions as part of any for-loop body in the caller. These symbols allow determination whether any for loops exist in the target or its callees and whether those loops (or any functions called within them) modify loop counters or other objects in ways that would violate the rule."
