  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided function. The only string/character-buffer operations are two calls to snprintf and subsequent calls to UT_BSP_DoText. Each snprintf call supplies the destination buffer size (sizeof(ReportBuffer)), which prevents snprintf itself from writing beyond ReportBuffer. The first snprintf uses a string literal (\"\"), which is valid. The second snprintf takes SegmentName as a %s argument; while a NULL SegmentName would be a runtime error, this is not a use of any <string.h> function and so is outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The indexed accesses through TestCounters->CaseCount are normal array accesses (not calls to string.h routines) and should be checked under other relevant rules if needed, but they are not subject to Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation specifically for Rule 21.17."
