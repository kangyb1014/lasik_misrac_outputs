  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment itself does not prove a violation. Whether Rule 8.13 is violated depends on the declaration of OS_DirCreate_Impl. If OS_DirCreate_Impl is declared as int32 OS_DirCreate_Impl(const char *path, uint32 access) then no violation. A violation occurs if OS_DirCreate_Impl is declared as int32 OS_DirCreate_Impl(char *path, uint32 access) while the function does not modify the path \u2014 in that case the pointer parameter should be const-qualified and Rule 8.13 would be violated."
