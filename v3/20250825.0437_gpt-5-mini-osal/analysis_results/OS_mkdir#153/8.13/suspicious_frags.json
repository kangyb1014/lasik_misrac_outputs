  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer const-qualification. The function parameter 'const char *path' is already const-qualified and therefore does not need investigation. The local array 'local_path' is used as an output buffer and must be modifiable by any function that writes into it (e.g. OS_TranslatePath), so its declaration itself is not necessarily a violation but should be checked in context of the called function prototypes. Other lines in the function do not involve pointer objects or pointer-typed parameters and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13. The three listed fragments are the call sites/declaration where const-qualification issues may arise (e.g., whether the called functions accept or should accept const-qualified pointers) and should be inspected against the prototypes of OS_TranslatePath and OS_DirCreate_Impl."
