  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are statically invariant. The only conditional is \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\" where return_code is assigned from the call to OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path), so the condition depends on a runtime function result and is not a constant/invariant expression. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) or other control statements with constant controlling expressions, and no preprocessor-generated constant conditions. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
