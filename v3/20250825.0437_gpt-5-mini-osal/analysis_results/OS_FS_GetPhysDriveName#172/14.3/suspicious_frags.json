  "explanation": "I examined all controlling constructs in the function. There are no loop constructs (for, while, do/while) in this code, and the only conditional statements are:\n- if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n- if ((filesys->flags & OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM) != 0)\nThese conditions depend on variables or object state and are not constant/invariant. The macros OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(MountPoint) and OS_CHECK_POINTER(PhysDriveName) could expand to additional checks, but nothing in the visible code shows an invariant controlling expression. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that warrant investigation for Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
