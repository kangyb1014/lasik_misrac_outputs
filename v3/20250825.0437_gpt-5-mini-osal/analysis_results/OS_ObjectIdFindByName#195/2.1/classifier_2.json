  "scenario": "No violation: the if-block is conditionally reachable when return_code == OS_SUCCESS (return_code is assigned from OS_ObjectIdGetByName). There is nothing in the fragment that makes it unreachable. Only if OS_ObjectIdGetByName were provably guaranteed to never return OS_SUCCESS (or if OS_SUCCESS were impossible) would the block be unreachable, which would require inspection of that function/definitions."
