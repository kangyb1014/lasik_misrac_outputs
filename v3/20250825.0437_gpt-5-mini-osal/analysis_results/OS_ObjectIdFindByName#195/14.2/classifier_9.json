  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdFindByName:\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindByName(osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, osal_id_t *object_id)\n{\n    int32             return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n\n    /*\n     * As this is an internal-only function, calling it with NULL is allowed.\n     * This is required by the file/dir/socket API since these DO allow multiple\n     * instances of the same name.\n     */\n    ARGCHECK(name, OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND);\n    LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, OS_ERR_NAME_TOO_LONG);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, idtype, name, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        *object_id = token.obj_id;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ObjectIdFindByName:\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, const char *name, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(lock_mode, idtype, OS_ObjectNameMatch, (void *)name, token);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t MatchFunc, void *arg,\n                             OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(lock_mode, idtype, token);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch(MatchFunc, arg, token);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /*\n         * The \"ConvertToken\" routine will return with the global lock\n         * in a state appropriate for returning to the caller, as indicated\n         * by the \"lock_mode\" parameter.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(token);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdRelease(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, NULL);\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(OS_object_token_t *token, const osal_id_t *final_id)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        /* nothing to do */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    record = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n\n    /* re-acquire global table lock to adjust refcount */\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE || token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT)\n    {\n        OS_Lock_Global(token);\n    }\n\n    if (record->refcount > 0)\n    {\n        --record->refcount;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * at this point the global mutex is always held, either\n     * from re-acquiring it above or it is still held from\n     * the original lock when using OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL.\n     *\n     * If an ID update was pending (i.e. for a create/delete op)\n     * then do the ID update now while holding the mutex.\n     */\n    if (final_id != NULL)\n    {\n        record->active_id = *final_id;\n    }\n    else if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE)\n    {\n        /*\n         * If the lock type was EXCLUSIVE, it means that the ID in the record\n         * was reset to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a single macro invocation (LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, OS_ERR_NAME_TOO_LONG)) and contains no for statement itself. Therefore Rule 14.2 (well\u2011formed for loops) does not apply. Only if the LENGTHCHECK macro were to expand into a for statement that violates the clause (for example, by modifying a non\u2011loop counter in the body or using more than one loop counter) would Rule 14.2 be violated; no such expansion is shown here."
