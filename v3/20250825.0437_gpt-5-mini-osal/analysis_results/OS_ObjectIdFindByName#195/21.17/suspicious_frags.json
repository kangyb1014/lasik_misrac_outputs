  "explanation": "The function body contains no direct calls to <string.h> functions; therefore only locations that could invoke string handling logic indirectly need inspection. The function signature is included because it declares the 'name' pointer parameter that is passed to downstream checks/calls. The ARGCHECK and LENGTHCHECK macros are suspicious because they commonly perform NULL and length validation and may call string functions (e.g. strlen, strnlen) \u2014 their implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not read beyond the buffer. The call to OS_ObjectIdGetByName passes the same 'name' pointer to another routine that may use string.h functions; that callee must be audited. Other fragments (variable declarations, the assignment '*object_id = token.obj_id;', the call 'OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);', the return statement, and the comment) do not perform string handling and therefore do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
