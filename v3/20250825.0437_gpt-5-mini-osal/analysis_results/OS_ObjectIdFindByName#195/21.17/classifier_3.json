  "scenario": "The statement ARGCHECK(name, OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND) by itself does not invoke any <string.h> functions and therefore does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation could only occur if the ARGCHECK macro's implementation used a string.h function (e.g. strlen, strcpy) in a way that accessed beyond the bounds of the object pointed to by 'name' (for example calling strlen(name) when name is NULL or not a null-terminated buffer). That possible internal implementation issue cannot be determined from this single fragment."
