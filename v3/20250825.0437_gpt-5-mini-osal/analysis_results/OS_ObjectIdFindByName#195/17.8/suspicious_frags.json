  "explanation": "Other lines in the function are simple declarations or the final return and do not involve pointer parameters or their pointees (e.g., variable declarations for return_code and token, the function prologue/epilogue). The listed fragments are those that either use the pointer parameters (name, object_id) directly, pass them to other routines, or perform casts that could affect constness; these therefore warrant investigation for compliance with the rule that function parameters themselves must not be modified. No other fragments in the provided code interact with function parameters in a way relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
