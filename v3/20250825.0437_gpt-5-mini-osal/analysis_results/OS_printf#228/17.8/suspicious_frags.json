  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not appear to modify the function parameter itself and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 17.8. There is no assignment to String (no \"String = ...\"), no pointer arithmetic on String, and no incremental/decremental operations on the parameter. The remaining operations only read from String (use it as a format string) or operate on local objects (va_list, msg_buffer, actualsz) or call other functions that receive String by value; such calls cannot directly modify the caller's pointer variable. The listed fragments are those places where the parameter is introduced or passed to macros/functions (which could hide behavior) and therefore warrant inspection to ensure the parameter itself is not altered by macro expansion or unexpected constructs. Other lines (e.g., msg_buffer manipulation, OS_ConsoleWrite call, va_end, error handling) do not affect the parameter and so do not need investigation for this rule."
