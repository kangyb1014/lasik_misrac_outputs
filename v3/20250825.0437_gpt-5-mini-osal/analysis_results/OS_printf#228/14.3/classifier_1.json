  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a function/macro invocation, not a controlling expression (if/for/while/do/switch). Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions; none are present here. (Only a potential violation would occur if the OS_DEBUG macro expanded to an if/loop with an invariant condition, e.g. if (0) ..., but there is no evidence of that in the fragment.)"
