  "explanation": "No loop controlling expressions (for, while, do-while) are present in the provided OS_DirectoryRead function or the related snippets. The only controlling constructs are if statements: \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\" and \"if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\", and these test the variable return_code which is assigned from function calls (e.g. OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit) so their values are not invariant. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro expands to BUGCHECK((ptr) != NULL, ...), which depends on the pointer parameter and is not a compile-time invariant. The OS_SUCCESS macro is a constant used as the comparison target but does not by itself make the controlling expression invariant. No do-while with an integer constant controlling expression or other permitted exceptions are present. Therefore there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to investigate in the supplied code."
