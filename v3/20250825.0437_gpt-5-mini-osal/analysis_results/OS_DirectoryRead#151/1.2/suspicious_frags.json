  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments for use of compiler-specific language extensions. No occurrences were found of explicit compiler-extension constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__ / __inline__ assembly, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions (GCC), labels-as-values (&&label), __builtin_* functions used as language extensions, __extension__ markers, Microsoft __declspec, or vendor-specific keywords. The code uses standard C and POSIX APIs (readdir, strncpy, va_list/vsnprintf) and ordinary typedefs/macros. The cppcheck-suppress comments are analyzer directives, not compiler language extensions. Variadic usage shown (OS_printf) is a standard C function, not a variadic macro or an extension.\n\nNote: Some macros referenced (e.g. BUGCHECK, OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) were not expanded in the snippets. If those macro definitions (or other headers not shown) themselves use compiler-specific extensions, those definitions would need to be reviewed. Based solely on the visible code, there are no explicit language extensions to report."
