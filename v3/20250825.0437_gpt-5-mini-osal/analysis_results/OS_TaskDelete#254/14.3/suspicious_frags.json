  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The MISRA C Rule 14.3 concern is constant/invariant controlling expressions in conditionals or loops. In the snippets shown: \n\n- OS_TaskDelete: conditionals such as \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\" and \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS && delete_hook != NULL)\" depend on the local variable return_code (set by OS_ObjectIdGetById/OS_TaskDelete_Impl/OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete) and delete_hook (read from the task record). These are runtime values and not constant.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: conditionals like \"if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\" and \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\" use return_code assigned from calls to other functions (OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken), so they are not invariant.\n\n- OS_TaskDelete_Impl: conditionals such as \"if (ret != 0)\" and the nested checks use ret assigned from pthread_cancel/pthread_join return values, which are runtime results and not constant.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: \"if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\" uses the function parameter operation_status, which varies at call time.\n\n- There are no loops in the provided snippets with constant controlling expressions (no while/for/do-while with constant conditions). The presence of the constant macro OS_SUCCESS (0) in comparisons does not by itself create an invariant controlling expression because it is compared against variables (return_code, operation_status, etc.).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code, there are no fragments that exhibit invariant controlling expressions requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
