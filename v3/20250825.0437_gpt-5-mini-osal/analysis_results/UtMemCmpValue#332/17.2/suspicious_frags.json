  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls). The function body contains no function calls at all (only a for loop, an array index, and return statements). There are no function-pointer usages, no macro expansions in the provided snippet, no callbacks, and no indirect call sites that could introduce recursion. Parameters are plain data pointers/integers (const void*, uint8, uint32), so there is no possibility of this fragment calling itself directly or indirectly based on the shown code. Therefore no code fragments require further investigation for recursion in this snippet."
