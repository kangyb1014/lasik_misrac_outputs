  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp, strncmp, strcasecmp, etc.) are present in the provided code. The function UtMemCmpValue performs an explicit byte-wise comparison of a memory region against a single byte value using a for-loop and a uint8 pointer; it does not compare null-terminated strings nor call memcmp. The typedefs shown (uint8, uint32) do not introduce any memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
