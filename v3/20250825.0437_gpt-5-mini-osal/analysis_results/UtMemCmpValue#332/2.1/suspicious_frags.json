  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasoning: all declarations at function entry are executed. The for loop condition (i < Length) is evaluated at runtime; if Length is zero the loop body is simply not entered and the final 'return true;' is reached (so that return is reachable). If Length > 0 the loop body is reachable and the 'return false;' inside the loop is reachable when a mismatching byte is encountered. There is no code after a guaranteed unconditional return, no mutually exclusive constant conditions, and no constructs that would render any statement unreachable for all possible inputs. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
