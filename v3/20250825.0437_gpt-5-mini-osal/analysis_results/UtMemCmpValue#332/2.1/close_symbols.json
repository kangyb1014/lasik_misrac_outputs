  "explanation": "Provide the definitions/types/meanings of these symbols so the next analyzer can determine whether any control-flow in UtMemCmpValue is in fact unreachable. Specific reasons:\n- bool: MISRA reachability analysis must know what \"bool\" expands to (e.g. C99 _Bool or a macro/typedef) because a nonstandard definition could affect return semantics or be implemented as something with side-effects or attributes.\n- true / false: need the actual definitions (macros or enum/constants) to ensure they are simple values and do not expand to statements or attributes that could alter control flow.\n- uint8: the element type of Byte_ptr and Value; its width/signedness affects comparison semantics and whether conversions could introduce undefined behaviour that changes control flow analysis.\n- uint32: the type of Length and i; its width and signedness determine loop termination behavior (wrap-around, comparison semantics) which is central to deciding if any code after/inside the loop is reachable.\n- Memory (const void * parameter): its type and any annotations (e.g. restrict, volatile, special attributes) could affect whether indexing causes undefined behaviour or hidden control-flow effects; also needed to check whether Memory could be defined via a macro that changes code structure.\n- Value (parameter): although a simple parameter, if it is defined through a macro or has annotations (volatile, const qualifier differences) it could affect comparisons/optimizations leading to apparent unreachable code.\n- Length (parameter): its value domain (e.g. if it is constrained by typedef, macro, or annotated as compile-time constant) affects whether the for-loop may be guaranteed to execute zero times and therefore whether subsequent code is reachable.\n- Byte_ptr (local variable): its initialization from Memory and any qualifiers (volatile, restrict) influence indexing semantics and potential side-effects; static analysis needs this to decide if the loop body or final return can be reached.\n- i (loop counter): its type and any possible compiler/runtime behavior for overflow or instrumentation affect whether the loop terminates and thus whether code after the loop is reachable.\n\nIn short, the analyzer needs the actual typedefs/definitions and any relevant qualifiers/attributes for these symbols (and true/false) to determine if the loop or return statements are guaranteed unreachable under project-specific definitions or macros."
