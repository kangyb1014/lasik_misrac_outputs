This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- uint8, uint32, bool: need the typedefs (or headers) to confirm sizes/representations and that indexing/count types behave as assumed (e.g. uint8 is a 1\u2011byte type). This impacts the interpretation of Length and byte accesses.\n- All call sites of UtMemCmpValue: to determine whether any invocation can pass a pointer/length pair that would make Byte_ptr[i] access beyond the referenced object; static analysis must inspect callers.\n- Declarations of the objects/buffers passed as Memory at each call site: the declared size (array bounds, struct field size) is required to check that accesses Byte_ptr[0..Length-1] are inside the object.\n- Expressions/macros/constants used to compute Length at each call site: Length may be computed from macros or sizeof expressions; their values/definitions are required to check bounds.\n- Allocation symbols and size expressions for heap buffers: if callers pass dynamically allocated buffers, the allocation size expression must be examined to ensure it is >= Length.\n- Any pointer arithmetic or casts before the call: calls that pass &buf[offset] or (uint8*)p + n change the effective remaining buffer size; these transformations must be analyzed to verify remaining length is sufficient.\n- Preconditions/annotations/contract for UtMemCmpValue: if the function relies on a documented caller contract (e.g. Memory non-NULL when Length>0, or Length <= provided buffer size), those annotations are needed to justify that accesses are safe.\n- Definitions of memory-mapped or external buffers: such buffers may have special sizes or alignment; their definitions are needed to determine whether indexing could go out of bounds.\n\nIn short: to assess whether UtMemCmpValue can access beyond the bounds of the object referenced by its Memory parameter (the MISRA string.h bounds rule analogue), you must examine the typedefs that affect indexing and every caller site plus the concrete buffer definitions/allocations/expressions that determine the valid range for Byte_ptr[0..Length-1], and any caller-side pointer adjustments or contracts that guarantee safety."
