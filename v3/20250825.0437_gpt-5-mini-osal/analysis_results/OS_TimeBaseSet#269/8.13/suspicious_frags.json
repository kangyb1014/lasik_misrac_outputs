  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The local scalar variables (return_code, objtype, start_time, interval_time, token) are value types or explicit outputs and not pointer declarations. - The ARGCHECK macro uses scalar comparisons (start_time, interval_time) \u2014 no pointers involved. - The call to OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(OS_TaskGetId_Impl()) uses value-returning functions; no pointers to object data are taken. - The timebase pointer (OS_timebase_internal_record_t *timebase) and the subsequent write operations timebase->nominal_start_time = start_time; timebase->nominal_interval_time = interval_time; show the pointed-to object is modified here, so the pointee cannot be const \u2014 therefore these lines are not candidates for conversion to a pointer-to-const. - Any other macros (e.g., OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) are used to obtain a modifiable record here; since the code writes fields, const-qualification of the pointee would be inappropriate. The listed fragments are the locations where a non-const pointer (via &token) is passed to functions; these should be inspected to determine whether the callee actually modifies the pointee or could accept a pointer-to-const (i.e., whether the pointer parameter could be const-qualified)."
