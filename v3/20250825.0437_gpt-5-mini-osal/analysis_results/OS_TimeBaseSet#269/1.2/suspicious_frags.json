  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related macro/type definitions for uses of compiler-specific language extensions. The code only uses standard C constructs: typedefs (int32_t/uint32_t), normal function calls, structure access, array indexing, preprocessor macros, and integer/constant macros. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous/unnamed language extensions, inline assembler, vendor pragmas, or other nonstandard keywords. The macros shown (ARGCHECK, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) expand to ordinary if/return and address/index expressions (the provided ARGCHECK text appears to have a typographical spacing error \"returnerrcode;\" but that is not a compiler extension). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
