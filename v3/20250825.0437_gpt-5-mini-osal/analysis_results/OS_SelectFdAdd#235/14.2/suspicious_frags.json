  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. A search of the provided code fragments (the body of OS_SelectFdAdd and all additional code supplied) reveals no for statements anywhere. The only macros shown are OS_CHECK_POINTER (expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)) and several inline/helpers; none of the provided definitions contain a for loop. The OS_SelectFdAdd implementation performs bit manipulation and calls OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, and that function and the other supplied helpers (OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl, OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl, OS_GetMaxForObjectType, OS_printf) likewise contain no for statements. Therefore there are no for-loop related fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 14.2. (If the omitted definition of BUGCHECK or any other external macro/function contains a for loop, that expansion would need to be inspected \u2014 but no such for loop is present in the code provided.)"
