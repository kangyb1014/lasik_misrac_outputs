  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/declarations of all macros, typedefs, constants and externally referenced functions/types used in the body \u2014 any of those may themselves be implemented with compiler-specific extensions (attributes, builtin functions, GCC-style statements/expressions, inline asm, compiler-specific typedefs like __int32, non-standard macro tricks, etc.).\n\n- OS_DEBUG: macro; may use variadic macros, token-pasting, or compiler-specific constructs. Inspect definition.\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: status macros/enum values \u2014 their definitions may use compiler extensions (e.g., enums with attributes or nonstandard base types).\n- OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE: API-level constants/macros \u2014 could be macros built from compiler extensions.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: these could be macros or constants that expand to expressions or builtin calls (getuid/geteuid wrappers) or use compiler-specific constructs; definition needed.\n- int32, uint32: typedefs for integer types \u2014 could be defined via compiler-specific types (e.g., __int32) or aliases using extensions; need to confirm they are standard typedefs (int32_t) and not compiler-specific.\n- mode_t, struct stat: platform typedef/struct \u2014 their definitions live in system headers and might include implementation-specific extensions or attributes; inspect to ensure no extensions used in declarations visible to this translation unit.\n- O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY: file open flags \u2014 macros from fcntl.h; inspect in case they are defined via non-standard constructs (rare but necessary for completeness).\n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP: permission-bit macros \u2014 defined in system headers; check definitions if they use any extension constructs.\n- open, fstat, fchmod, close, strerror: externally declared functions \u2014 their prototypes (in system headers) can include compiler-specific attributes or extensions (e.g., __attribute__, nonstandard linkage); these must be checked.\n- errno: macro or lvalue that may expand to a function call or thread-local object (e.g., __errno_location()); such implementations can be compiler-specific and must be inspected.\n- ENOTSUP, ENOSYS, EROFS: errno value macros \u2014 defined in errno.h; check definitions for any extension usage.\n\nInspecting these symbols' definitions/declarations will allow the next analyzer to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used (and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated)."
