  "explanation": "For checking compliance with the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must be certain that none of the referenced symbols (macros, types, or called functions) can modify the formal parameters local_path or access_mode or expand into code that assigns to them. Explanations: \n\n- OS_DEBUG: a macro \u2014 could expand to code with side effects (including assignments). Need its definition to ensure it does not reassign parameters. \n- open, fstat, fchmod, close, strerror: function prototypes/signatures are needed to confirm they do not modify the parameter variables (e.g., open takes a const char * path argument and will not assign to the caller's parameter variable). Also to ensure they are not implemented as macros with side effects. \n- errno: may be a macro or function-like accessor; its definition is needed to verify it does not expand to code that writes to parameter variables. \n- struct stat, mode_t: definitions are required to confirm that only members of the local 'st' object are modified and that no aliasing occurs with parameters. \n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP: permission-bit macros/constants \u2014 include to ensure they are simple constants/macros (no side effects or expressions that could modify parameters). \n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: constants/macros used in comparisons \u2014 include to ensure they are simple values without side effects. \n- OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE: access_mode enumerants/constants \u2014 needed to ensure they are simple values (no side effects) and that comparisons do not hide assignments. \n- O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY: flags for open() \u2014 include to ensure they are simple constants/macros with no side effects. \n- uint32, int32: typedefs for parameter/return types \u2014 include to confirm these are plain integer types and that no strange macro substitution could alter parameter semantics. \n- OS_ERROR, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_SUCCESS: return-code constants \u2014 included to ensure they are simple constants and that any macros do not perform hidden assignments.\n\nWith these symbols available, an analyzer can determine whether any macro expansions or called-function behaviors could cause an assignment to the parameter variables (local_path or access_mode) and thus violate the MISRA rule."
