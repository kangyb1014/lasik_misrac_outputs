  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA C \"no unreachable code\" analysis we must know which conditionals and calls could be compile-time constant, non-returning, or otherwise force/avoid execution of subsequent statements. Briefly, each symbol is required for the following reason:\n\n- open, O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY\n  - Needed to know whether the open() calls can be resolved as ordinary returning calls and whether the O_* macros change behavior. If open had a noreturn attribute (or macros expand to a non-returning construct) or if O_* are special, code after open might be unreachable.\n\n- fstat\n  - fstat() return behavior affects whether the code inside the else (mode manipulation and fchmod) is reachable. Also if fstat were declared noreturn that would affect reachability.\n\n- fchmod\n  - fchmod() behavior determines which branches after the call are taken (errno checks, setting status). If fchmod were non-returning the code after it would be unreachable.\n\n- close\n  - close() must be a normal returning function; if it were non-returning it would make code after the close unreachable. Also ensures the comment about always closing fd is meaningful.\n\n- strerror, errno\n  - errno is read after failing syscalls; if errno is a macro with unusual behavior this could affect branch conditions. strerror is used only for diagnostics but could be non-returning in a platform-specific way; include to rule that out.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - OS_DEBUG is used in early return/error reporting; if it expands to a non-returning construct (e.g., abort/longjmp) it could make later code unreachable. Need its definition/semantics.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID\n  - These are compared to st.st_uid and st.st_gid. If they are compile-time constants or macros that force a particular branch (or expand to something that changes control flow), that can make the ownership branches unreachable or always taken. Their definitions are required to decide reachability of the user/group ownership blocks.\n\n- OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE, OS_READ_ONLY\n  - These macros determine the access_mode comparisons. If they are compile-time-fixed or overlap, some read/write branches could be unreachable. Need their definitions and intended distinct values.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED\n  - Return values/macros used at multiple return sites. If any expands to a control-flow altering construct (unlikely but must be checked) this could mark code after as unreachable; they are also needed to understand which return paths exist.\n\n- struct stat (definition), mode_t (typedef)\n  - Required to know the fields st_uid, st_gid, st_mode exist as used and whether accessing them is valid; also to determine if comparisons against OS_IMPL_SELF_* are sensible at compile time (e.g., if types force constant folding).\n\n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP\n  - These constants control which mode-bit modifications are performed. If any of these are defined such that operations on st.st_mode become no-ops (e.g., zero), that can make some branches effectively no-ops but not necessarily unreachable; still needed to see if code is trivially dead.\n\n- ENOTSUP, ENOSYS, EROFS\n  - errno comparisons after fchmod determine which error-path branch is taken. Their definitions are required to see if the errno checks can overlap or be equivalent, or if they are compile-time constants that render one branch unreachable.\n\n- int32 (typedef), uint32 (typedef)\n  - The parameter and return typedefs are needed to ensure there are no hidden conversions or macro expansions that alter control flow (for completeness of static analysis).\n\nIn short: include syscall/prototype semantics (open/fstat/fchmod/close/strerror/errno), platform constants (O_*, S_*, errno macros), OSAL configuration macros (OS_IMPL_SELF_*, OS_READ/WRITE constants), return-code macros, and the struct/type definitions. These let the next analyzer determine whether any conditional or call in OS_FileChmod_Impl is compile-time determinable as always true/false or non-returning, which is necessary to establish presence or absence of unreachable code."
