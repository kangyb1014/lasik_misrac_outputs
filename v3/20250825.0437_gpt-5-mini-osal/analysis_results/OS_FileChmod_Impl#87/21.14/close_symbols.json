  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to analyze MISRA rule \"memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\":\n\n- memcmp\n  - Direct target of the MISRA rule. The analysis must check whether memcmp is invoked in this function (or in any inlined/project-level callees) to compare null-terminated strings (e.g. local_path or strings returned by strerror). Include the memcmp symbol so the next agent can search for its uses and argument patterns.\n\n- local_path\n  - The function parameter of type const char*. If memcmp is used anywhere in this function (or passed into callees) it might be used to compare this null-terminated path. The analyzer must treat this symbol as a candidate null-terminated string subject to erroneous memcmp usage.\n\n- strerror\n  - Returns a pointer to a null-terminated error string which is passed to OS_DEBUG in this function. The analyzer should verify that strerror's return is not compared via memcmp (either here or in any wrapper/debug helpers) which would violate the rule.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - A project logging macro/function that receives strings (including strerror(...) and local_path). Its definition/body must be inspected to ensure it does not perform memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings (e.g. for conditional logging or internal helpers).\n\n- open\n  - The system/library call which receives local_path. If the project provides a wrapper or inlined variant of open, that wrapper could contain memcmp misuse; include open so the analyzer can resolve whether an application-level wrapper (not the kernel call) is used.\n\n- fstat\n  - Called with the file descriptor; included to ensure there is no project-level wrapper or inlined implementation that performs string comparisons using memcmp on paths or other null-terminated strings used here.\n\n- fchmod\n  - The final operation that sets mode bits. Included so the analyzer can detect any project wrappers or inlined implementations that might perform string comparisons with memcmp.\n\n- close\n  - Close is used on fd; include to allow checking for project-level variants that might perform string comparisons (rare but included for completeness).\n\n- errno\n  - The global error indicator whose value is passed to strerror and used in debug output. Included because misuse of memcmp could involve comparing errno-derived message strings; the analyzer should know where errno-derived strings originate and are used.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID\n  - Macro/constant compared against st.st_uid. Included because it is a project symbol referenced in this function; checking its definition ensures it is not a wrapper that internally compares strings using memcmp (unlikely but required for completeness).\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID\n  - Same rationale as OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID for st.st_gid comparisons and to ensure no hidden string comparisons via memcmp in its definition.\n\n- OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE\n  - Access-mode constants used to select permission changes. Included so the analyzer can fully resolve control-flow and confirm no code path performs memcmp string comparisons when evaluating these modes (e.g., if these are macros/functions rather than plain constants).\n\nNotes:\n- The system calls (open, fstat, fchmod, close, strerror) are typically library/kernel functions and their internal use of memcmp is not considered an application-level MISRA violation. However, many projects supply wrappers or macros for these calls; the analyzer must have access to the project-level definitions to be sure there is no memcmp-based string comparison in application code paths. The listed symbols cover the parameters and any project-level wrappers most relevant to detecting the prohibited use of memcmp on null-terminated strings in or reachable from this function."
