Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "- UT_BSP_DoText: UtMessage calls this function. To determine whether any for-loop-related behaviour affecting UtMessage exists (e.g. indirect modification of objects used as loop counters, or macros/inlines that expand into for loops), the body/definition of UT_BSP_DoText must be inspected. The MISRA rule refers to the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop body, and any loop interaction originating in a callee could be relevant.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: This type defines Buf. If it is a macro, typedef or struct with unusual definitions (macros can expand to code containing for loops or loop-like constructs), those expansions/definitions must be inspected to be sure no for-loop appears implicitly in UtMessage.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t.Text: The member used as the destination buffer and passed to sizeof() and vsnprintf. Its declaration (array vs pointer, size macros) could involve macros or definitions that expand to code with loops or side-effects; knowing its exact definition is needed to rule out hidden for loops or side effects that would affect loop-well-formedness.\n\n- vsnprintf: Standard library call used here; inspect whether it is mapped to any local wrapper or macro (some codebases replace the C library call with an inline/wrapper that could contain loops or side-effects). Confirming the actual implementation ensures no hidden for loops or side-effects relevant to MISRA rule.\n\n- va_start and va_end: These are macros (or functions) that set up/tear down variadic argument handling. If they are redefined or wrapped in this project they could expand to code with loops or side-effects; their actual definitions should be checked to ensure they do not introduce for-loops or modify potential loop counters.\n\n- va_list: The variadic argument type. Its definition/aliasing in the project headers should be checked only if project headers redefine it in a way that could introduce unexpected behaviour (rare, but consistent with checking macros/typedefs that could hide loops).\n\nNotes: UtMessage itself contains no explicit for statement, so the primary concerns are (1) whether any macros/types used in its source expand to for loops, and (2) whether the callee UT_BSP_DoText (or any wrappers of vsnprintf/va macros) contains for loops whose interaction with any for loops in UtMessage would matter. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to confirm there are no hidden/expanded for loops or side-effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
