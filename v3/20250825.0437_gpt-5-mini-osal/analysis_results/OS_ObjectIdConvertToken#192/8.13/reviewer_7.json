True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function parameter 'OS_object_token_t *token' is only read (e.g. here: if (token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)) and the function does not modify the token itself. The pointer therefore could be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token). Because the pointer is not const-qualified although it could be, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The claim is correct based on the code shown: OS_ObjectIdConvertToken never writes through the token pointer (no assignments to *token or token->...), it only reads fields and passes the pointer to other functions. Therefore, from the perspective of this function alone the parameter could be declared as const OS_object_token_t *token to make intent explicit and satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n\nCaveat: whether the change is feasible in the wider codebase depends on the prototypes/semantics of the called functions (OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_WaitForStateChange, OS_Unlock_Global). If any of those functions are declared to take a non-const pointer and actually modify the token, then making this parameter const would not be possible without changing those APIs. But nothing in the function body itself necessitates a non-const parameter, so the agent A report that this function violates Rule 8.13 is correct for the snippet shown."
