  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related code provided. There are no calls to the string.h functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) or other typical string-manipulation functions that take pointer + length parameters and could cause out-of-bounds accesses. The only string-related call is strerror(ret) in OS_Unlock_Global_Impl used inside an OS_DEBUG format; strerror takes an integer and returns a pointer to an internal static message \u2014 it does not accept a caller-supplied buffer/pointer that could be indexed out-of-bounds, so it is not relevant to Rule 21.17. Other potentially sensitive operations in the code (e.g., indexing OS_common_table via OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken or locking/wait logic) are not string.h calls and thus fall outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for this specific rule."
