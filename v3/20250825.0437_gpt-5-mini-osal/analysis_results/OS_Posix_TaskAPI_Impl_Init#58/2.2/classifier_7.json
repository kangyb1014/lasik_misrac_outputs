  "scenario": "Yes \u2014 the memset(&sched_rr_limits, 0, sizeof(sched_rr_limits)); is executed but removable without changing program behaviour. sched_rr_limits is always populated by OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams() before any use (the code only reads sched_rr_limits when sched_rr_valid is true, and OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams writes the fields on success). If the getter fails the limits are not used. Therefore the memset only serves to suppress a compiler warning and its removal would not affect runtime behaviour, which meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
