  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- queue_id is passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById and is not assigned to or altered anywhere in the function.\n- data is declared const void * and only used in the null-check macro (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and passed unchanged to OS_QueuePut_Impl; there is no assignment to the data parameter itself.\n- size is validated with OS_CHECK_SIZE and compared to queue->max_size, but is not assigned to or modified.\n- flags is passed through to OS_QueuePut_Impl without modification.\n- The macros shown (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_SIZE, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) do not perform assignments to the function parameters; OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET takes the address of the local token, not of any function parameter.\n\nThe only potential modifications occur to the local variable token (via OS_ObjectIdGetById) and to the object pointed to by data may be modified by OS_QueuePut_Impl, but that would be within that callee, not a modification of OS_QueuePut's parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
