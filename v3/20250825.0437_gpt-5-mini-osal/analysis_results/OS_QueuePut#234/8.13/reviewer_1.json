True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf the prototype of OS_QueuePut_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer (for example: int32 OS_QueuePut_Impl(OS_object_token_t *token, void *data, size_t size, uint32 flags)), then passing the local parameter data which is declared as const void * discards the const qualifier. That constitutes a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when the data is not modified. To fix, declare OS_QueuePut_Impl to accept a const void * for the data parameter (or otherwise ensure the callee actually needs to modify the data and change the caller accordingly).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The OS_QueuePut function as shown declares its data parameter as const void * \u2014 that already follows the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The scenario described by agent A only leads to a problem if the callee OS_QueuePut_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer. In that case the violation is in the callee's prototype (it should use const if it does not modify the data), or there is an illegal qualifier-discarding conversion at the call site (which would be a different issue). Therefore the reported claim that OS_QueuePut itself violates Rule 8.13 is incorrect. The correct resolution is to update OS_QueuePut_Impl to accept const void * (if it does not modify the data), or else make the const qualification consistent between caller and callee so no qualifier is discarded; also ensure the prototype is visible to avoid implicit conversions/warnings."
