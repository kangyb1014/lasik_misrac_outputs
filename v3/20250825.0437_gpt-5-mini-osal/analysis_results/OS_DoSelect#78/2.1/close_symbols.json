  "explanation": "To decide whether any portion of OS_DoSelect is statically unreachable (MISRA rule about unreachable code) the analyzer must know the definitions/semantics of external symbols and the calling context that can make certain branches impossible. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- OS_SelectSingle_Impl: one of the direct callers. Its implementation (how it computes and passes msecs, maxfd, rd_set/wr_set) can make some branches in OS_DoSelect (msecs <0 / ==0 / >0) never occur; need its code to determine reachable paths.\n- OS_SelectMultiple_Impl: the other direct caller. Same rationale as above \u2014 its call-site behavior may constrain msecs and fd set arguments and therefore render branches unreachable.\n- clock_gettime: called when msecs>0 and inside the retry loop; its prototype/semantics (possible failure modes, whether it can be a macro) affect whether the time computations/branches are meaningful or can be optimized away.\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC: constant used with clock_gettime; its definition could matter if build-time configuration makes clock_gettime resolve differently (affects analysis of time-based branches).\n- select: the core syscall invoked. Its return-value semantics (negatives on error, setting errno, zero on timeout, positive on events) are needed to judge reachability of post-select branches and the do/while retry condition.\n- errno: the global checked in the loop condition. To know if the while condition can ever be true, you must know errno's behavior/visibility and whether it can be equal to EINTR/EAGAIN after select.\n- EINTR: value used in retry condition. Needed to determine if (errno == EINTR) can be true at runtime for the given environment/syscall.\n- EAGAIN: same as EINTR; used in retry condition and needed for reachability of the loop continuation.\n- memset: called in the else branch when msecs <= 0; its presence/definition can influence whether the ts_end zeroing branch is a no-op or has other side-effects (and whether that branch is used by callers that never pass msecs>0).\n- OS_ERROR: symbolic return code used when select fails. Knowing its definition is needed to map os_status outcomes to return values and to determine whether some return branches are redundant or unreachable in the system context.\n- OS_ERROR_TIMEOUT: symbolic return code for timeout (os_status == 0). Needed to judge whether the timeout-return branch can be reached given callers and select semantics.\n- OS_SUCCESS: symbolic return code for positive select result. Needed to determine whether the success-return branch can be reached.\n- struct timespec: definition (member types and signedness of tv_sec/tv_nsec). Necessary to check the arithmetic and comparison logic that determines whether the computed tv can be negative (which affects the early break and thus reachability of subsequent code).\n- struct timeval: definition (member types and signedness of tv_sec/tv_usec). Necessary for the same reason as timespec \u2014 the conversions, signedness and range affect whether branches checking tv.tv_sec < 0 or tv.tv_usec < 0 are possible.\n- int32 (typedef): type definition of the int32 parameter/return type. Knowing its range and signedness is needed to reason about comparisons with 0 (msecs) and whether certain branches are possible or eliminated by type constraints.\n\nIncluding these symbols (their prototypes/definitions and the callers' implementations) supplies the information required to determine whether any conditional or block in OS_DoSelect is provably never executed in the actual project build/configuration."
