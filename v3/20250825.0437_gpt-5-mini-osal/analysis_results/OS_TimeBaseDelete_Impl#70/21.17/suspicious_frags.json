  "explanation": "No other calls to the string.h string-handling functions (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function or related definitions. The remaining code lines are calls to pthread_cancel and timer_delete, simple assignments, array indexing via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and structure/table declarations \u2014 none of which invoke string.h functions or perform pointer-based string/byte copies that could access beyond object bounds. The provided OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty in the additional code, so in this build it does not introduce any string.h usage; therefore the only expression that may involve a string library (strerror(errno)) is the fragment listed above and should be investigated."
