  "explanation": "The submitted function contains no calls to memcmp or any other explicit memory-comparison routine used to compare strings. The only string-related usage is strerror(errno) for error reporting, which returns a pointer to an error message and is not used for comparison. No macros or wrapper calls in this fragment invoke memcmp, and there are no comparisons of null-terminated strings (no strcmp, memcmp, or manual byte-wise comparisons). Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
