  "scenario": "The declaration is for an array (char local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN]) not a pointer. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations being const-qualified when possible. Additionally, this buffer is used as an output-modifiable array (passed to OS_TranslatePath which writes into it), so qualifying it as const would be incorrect. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 8.13."
