  "explanation": "The only operations in the provided code that appear to be effectively dead are the debug/logging call and the macro that disables it. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty, so any invocation (including the call that passes strerror(errno)) expands to nothing \u2014 the call and its argument evaluation are not present in the compiled code and thus are dead/no-op from a behaviour perspective and should be investigated. All other statements in OS_SocketListen_Impl perform functional operations (obtaining the impl record, calling listen(), checking the return value and returning OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS) whose removal would change program behaviour, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2. The surrounding higher-level logic (token/table access, stream state checks, and the handling in OS_SocketBind) likewise affect control flow or state and therefore are not reported as dead code."
