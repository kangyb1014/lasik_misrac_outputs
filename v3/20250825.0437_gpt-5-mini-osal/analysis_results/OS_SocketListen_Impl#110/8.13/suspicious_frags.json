  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token), the listen call uses an integer file descriptor (impl->fd) not a pointer type, and the function return type and local scalar variables do not involve pointer-to-object types. The extern array declaration (OS_impl_filehandle_table) is a non-const object; while it is related to pointer usage, the actual pointer variables/usages that could drop const-qualification are covered in the reported fragments above. No other pointer declarations or expressions are present in the provided code that would be candidates for adding const qualification under Rule 8.13."
