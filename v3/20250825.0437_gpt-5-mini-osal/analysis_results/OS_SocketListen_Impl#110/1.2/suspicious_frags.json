  "explanation": "I examined the provided code and related definitions for constructs that could be compiler-specific language extensions. The following were considered but are not reported as suspicious because they are standard C language features or standard library/POSIX functions rather than compiler extensions:\n\n- The use of the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its invocation with *token (the macro trick of using &(tok) is standard preprocessor usage, not a language extension).\n- The variadic macro definition #define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) (variadic macros are part of standard C since C99).\n- The static inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (the inline keyword is standard since C99).\n- The use of the bool type in the struct (bool is standard when stdbool.h is available; this is not a compiler extension).\n- Use of standard/POSIX APIs and symbols such as listen, strerror, errno (these are library/OS APIs, not C language extensions).\n- Use of extern array definitions, typedefs, and ordinary pointer/address operations.\n\nIf you are targeting a particular compiler or an older C standard version where features like variadic macros or inline are not supported, then those would need to be checked against that compiler\u2019s documentation; however, based solely on the code shown and current standard C features, there are no explicit compiler language extensions present that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 reporting."
