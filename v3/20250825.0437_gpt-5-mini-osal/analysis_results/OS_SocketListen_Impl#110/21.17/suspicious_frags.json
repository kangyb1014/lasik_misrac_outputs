  "explanation": "Only the invocation that uses strerror and the OS_DEBUG macro definition need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule concerns use of string-handling functions from <string.h>. No other string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are called in the shown code. The call to listen(impl->fd, 10) and the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro (indexing into OS_impl_filehandle_table) do not use functions from <string.h> and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. The struct definition and the OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS macros are also unrelated to string handling and cannot cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects via string.h functions."
