  "explanation": "I have reported all locations that could make following code unreachable depending on the expansion/behavior of the project macros/functions. Specifically, the various BUGCHECK/ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK/OS_CHECK_POINTER/BUGCHECK_VOID macros (and the UtAssert_Abort wrapper calling UT_BSP_DoText) are the only constructs in the provided snippets that may invoke non-local termination or return (or otherwise alter control flow in a way that could render subsequent statements unreachable). Other code fragments (simple assignments, the call to OS_ObjectIdGetByName, the conditional if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) { ... }, the subsequent return statements, and the normal use of OS_DEBUG/OS_ConsoleWrite/formatting in OS_printf) are standard conditional or sequential control-flow constructs and are not themselves evidence of unreachable code: their reachability depends on runtime conditions and they do not contain syntactic unreachable code (e.g., code following an unconditional return within the same block, or code after an infinite loop). Therefore these other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided excerpts."
