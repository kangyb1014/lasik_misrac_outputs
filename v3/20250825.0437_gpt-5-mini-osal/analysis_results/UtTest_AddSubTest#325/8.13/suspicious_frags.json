  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this function. Reasons:\n- All character pointers that could and should be const are declared as const char * (GroupName, TestName, GroupPtr, TestPtr). These point to immutable string data and are correctly const-qualified.\n- The local buffer CompleteTestName is a modifiable char array used as the snprintf destination; it must not be const.\n- The function-pointer parameters (void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void)) are pointers to functions; C does not permit const-qualification of function types (and the MISRA rule concerns pointer-to-const-qualified types, not making the pointer variable itself const). Thus no additional const-qualification is possible or required for these parameters.\n- Pointer arithmetic and comparisons are performed on const char * pointers (GroupPtr/TestPtr) and are appropriate for read-only traversal of the strings.\n\nGiven the above, there are no places in this function where a pointer should be changed to point to a const-qualified type but is not, so no suspicious fragments are reported."
