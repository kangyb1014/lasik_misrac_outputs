  "explanation": "I reviewed the controlling expressions in the function. There are two while loops: \n- while (*GroupPtr != 0 && *GroupPtr == *TestPtr)\n- while (TestPtr > TestName && *TestPtr != '_')\n\nNeither of these controlling expressions is invariant: both depend on pointer values or pointed-to characters that are modified inside the loops (the first loop increments GroupPtr and TestPtr; the second loop decrements TestPtr). Therefore the conditions can change across iterations and are not constant/invariant. There are no do-while loops or other constructs with a compile-time constant controlling expression, and no infinite-loop patterns that would trigger the permitted exception. The remaining conditional (if (*TestPtr == '_') and if (strncmp(...) == 0) and if (TestName != NULL)) are simple branches, not loops, and their controlling expressions are not compile-time invariant in a way that would be problematic for Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
