The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect each external symbol that the target function or its callees reference to decide whether any for-loop in the function (or functions called inside a for-loop) would violate the MISRA for-loop constraints (side effects, loop-counter modification, extra modified objects, etc.). Specific reasons:\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon: Called from the target function. Although the target uses while loops (no for in this function), MISRA requires the behaviour of any functions called within a loop to be considered \u2014 therefore the implementation/signature of UtTest_AddCommon must be checked to ensure it does not get invoked from a for-loop here (it is not) and to ensure it does not modify any objects that could act as loop counters or control flags via aliasing.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock, UtList_Add, UT_BSP_Unlock: These are direct callees of UtTest_AddCommon per the static call graph. To fully reason about side effects that might affect loop counters or loop-control flags (including through global state), the implementations of these lower-level functions must be examined.\n\n- strncmp: Used to compare GroupName with the literal \"Test_\". You need to confirm it has no persistent side effects (it is a pure comparision routine) so it cannot violate the MISRA rule by altering loop counters/objects used in loop conditions.\n\n- snprintf: Used to write CompleteTestName. Confirm it only writes the provided buffer and has no hidden side effects that would affect loop counters or objects used in loop conditions.\n\n- UTASSERT_GROUP_TEST: Macro/constant passed to UtTest_AddCommon \u2014 its value/definition could influence UtTest_AddCommon behaviour (and thus any side effects). Include it so the next analyst can see whether it affects control-flow/side-effects relevant to MISRA loop requirements.\n\nNote: The target function contains no for-loops itself; the purpose of listing these symbols is to allow the next analyzer to verify that none of the called functions (directly or indirectly) would be invoked inside a for-loop in this function or would otherwise introduce side effects that would make a for-loop in this codebase non-conforming. If you want to be exhaustive, also provide the full declarations (prototypes) and implementations of the listed symbols so their side-effects and parameter aliasing can be inspected."
