  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function are variant and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: - The loop termination test if (token->obj_idx >= obj_count) is variant because token->obj_idx is incremented each iteration (++token->obj_idx). - The conditional if (OS_ObjectIdDefined(record->active_id) && MatchFunc(arg, token, record)) depends on record (obtained from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(base, *token)) and on the result of MatchFunc, so it is not an invariant. - No do-while constructs are present. Therefore the only controlling expression that could be considered invariant in the code is the while (true) loop control; it should be investigated to ensure it meets the allowed exceptions for invariant controlling expressions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
