  "explanation": "No code fragments in the supplied code are clearly unreachable. Reasons:\n- There are no statements placed after an unconditional return in the same block; each return is a terminal statement for that execution path.\n- Conditional blocks (for example the if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) blocks) are governed by runtime return_code values and are therefore potentially reachable depending on inputs; they are not statically dead.\n- Early returns (e.g. returning when OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit fails) are legitimate error-handling paths and do not create unreachable code elsewhere in the shown functions.\n- The OS_DirRewind_Impl function performs an operation and returns OS_SUCCESS; it is reachable when called and does not contain dead code.\n\nNote: macros and external functions (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, rewinddir, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit/ToArrayIndex/ConvertToken/TransactionCancel, etc.) are only partially shown. If any of those expand to constructs that do not return (e.g. longjmp/exit) or contain unconditional returns, additional investigation of their definitions would be needed to fully assess reachability. Based on the provided code alone, there are no explicit unreachable code fragments to report."
