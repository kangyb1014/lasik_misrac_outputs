  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The only conditional controls are: (1) if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) and (2) if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) (appearing multiple times). In each case the controlling operand is the variable 'return_code', which is assigned from function calls (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken) and therefore may vary at runtime \u2014 these are not invariant expressions. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant controls such as while(1) or do { } while(0) that would need special consideration under the rule and its exceptions. The macro OS_SUCCESS is a constant (0) but it is only used as the RHS of comparisons with a non-constant variable, which does not make the controlling expression invariant. Consequently there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
