  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown usage. The expression &Retcode yields a pointer to a local (non-const) object which is passed to UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue; if that function's parameter is a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *), then no MISRA 8.13 violation occurs because the callee will not modify the object and the pointer need not be declared as pointing to a non-const type. A violation would occur if UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue actually expects a non-const pointer (e.g. void *) and could modify the pointed-to object \u2014 in that scenario the code is using a pointer to a modifiable type where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate."
