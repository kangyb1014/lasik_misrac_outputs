  "explanation": "The only pointer usage in this function is the address-of operator applied to the local parameter 'Retcode'. Rule 8.13 concerns pointers that should point to const-qualified types whenever possible; therefore the call that takes '&Retcode' is the relevant fragment to inspect (it produces a pointer to a non-const object). Other fragments do not create or pass non-const pointers: the Count check (if (Count <= 0)) is a scalar comparison, the UtAssert_Failed call passes scalar values and a format string, sizeof(Retcode) yields a size_t value, and the NULL argument is a pointer constant rather than a pointer to a non-const object. Hence no other parts of this function present additional potential Rule 8.13 issues."
