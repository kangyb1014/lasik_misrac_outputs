  "explanation": "- UtList_GetHead: must inspect its body and its callees to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls UtList_Add, which would create recursion.\\n- UtList_NewNode: same reason \u2014 if NewNode creation calls back into UtList_Add (directly or via other functions) that forms indirect recursion.\\n- UtList_Insert_Before: must be checked for calls (direct or transitive) that would reach UtList_Add.\\n- Transitive callees of the three functions: recursion can be indirect and may occur several levels down; include full transitive closure of their callees so the entire reachable call graph from UtList_Add can be examined for cycles back to UtList_Add.\\n- Definitions of UtListHead_t and UtListNode_t: these types may contain function-pointer members or fields that cause indirect calls; their layout and member types are needed to detect calls made via data structures.\\n- Any function-pointer typedefs/callbacks referenced: calls via function pointers are a form of indirect call that can create recursion; include their declarations/targets so such indirect paths can be analyzed.\\n- Macros used inside the above functions that expand to function calls: macro expansions can hide calls that contribute to an indirect call cycle, so include them to avoid missing a recursion path."
