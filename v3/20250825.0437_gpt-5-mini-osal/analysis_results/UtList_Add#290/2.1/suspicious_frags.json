  "explanation": "No syntactically unreachable code is present in the provided function. All statements are potentially reachable: the assignment to TagHead is executed unconditionally; the three statements inside the if-block are executed when the runtime condition (TagHead != NULL) holds. There are no constant boolean expressions, no statements following an unconditional return, no labels/gotos that skip code, and no infinite loops that would render subsequent code unreachable. (Note: potential runtime issues such as dereferencing a NULL NewNode returned by UtList_NewNode are defects but are not instances of unreachable code and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.)"
