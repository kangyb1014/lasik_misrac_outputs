  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Add (or any function it invokes) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we must inspect the code that actually performs comparisons or handles the Data buffer. Explainations: \n\n- UtList_GetHead: UtList_Add calls this to locate TagHead. GetHead may compare node data or keys and could call memcmp (or strcmp/strncmp) on stored data \u2014 we must inspect its implementation to see whether memcmp is used on null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- UtList_NewNode: This constructs the node from Data and DataSize. It may copy or validate Data, and may perform comparisons or use memcmp internally. Its implementation is required to see whether memcmp is used incorrectly or whether Data is known to be a string vs. raw bytes.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before: Insertion logic can include comparisons (to find insertion point) or sanity checks that might use memcmp/strcmp. Inspecting it ensures no hidden memcmp usage.\n\n- UtListNode_t and UtListHead_t: The node/head structure definitions are required to determine the type and interpretation of the Data stored in nodes (e.g., whether nodes hold char* or raw buffers, presence of string length fields, null terminators). This is essential to decide whether any memcmp calls compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): Knowing the exact typedef/width and semantics of DataSize/Tag can clarify whether DataSize is a string length or arbitrary byte count; this affects whether memcmp usage would be comparing null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, memcpy (standard functions): These are the likely standard library routines to look for in the implementations. memcmp is the rule target; strcmp/strncmp are the safe string comparison alternatives (and their presence helps interpretation); memcpy shows how Data bytes are handled. We must find any usage of memcmp and verify its arguments (are they pointers to null\u2011terminated strings and is the length derived from strlen?).\n\n- All direct and indirect callees of UtList_GetHead, UtList_NewNode and UtList_Insert_Before: If those functions call other helpers, those helpers may contain memcmp calls. The full call chain implementations are required to be certain no memcmp misuse occurs.\n\nProvide the source/definitions for the listed functions, struct/type definitions and any helper functions called by them so the next analyst can locate any memcmp usage and determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
