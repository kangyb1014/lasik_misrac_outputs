Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Brief justification for each required symbol:\n\n- UtList_GetHead (function definition/body): The MISRA for\u2011loop rule requires analyzing the behaviour of any functions called from inside a for loop body. Although UtList_Add contains no for loop itself, UtList_GetHead is a direct callee of UtList_Add; if any caller or future change places UtList_GetHead inside a for loop, or if Insert/NewNode call into it, its body must be inspected for for loops that could violate the rule. We need the full body to find any for loops and analyze their clauses and side effects.\n\n- UtList_NewNode (function definition/body): UtList_Add calls UtList_NewNode. The body may contain for loops (or call other functions that do). To judge compliance we must inspect its implementation (loop counters, side effects, objects modified in body) and any functions it calls.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before (function definition/body): This function is called after creating the node and could contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags. Its body (and any functions it calls) must be examined to verify loop well\u2011formedness and that loop counters are not modified in the body.\n\n- UtListNode_t (struct/type definition): UtList_Add writes NewNode->Tag. To determine whether a for loop in any callee modifies the same object(s) used as loop control (or whether node fields are used as loop counters/flags), the structure layout and field types are needed (e.g., which fields are mutable, types of Tag and other fields referenced in loops).\n\n- UtListHead_t (struct/type definition): Callees operate on the list head; loops in those functions may use fields of UtListHead_t as loop counters or flags. Knowing the head structure is necessary to see which objects are read/written in loop conditions or bodies.\n\n- Definitions/declarations of any global variables or file\u2011scope objects referenced by UtList_GetHead/UtList_NewNode/UtList_Insert_Before: The MISRA clause forbids loop conditions or increment clauses that use objects modified in the loop body (including globals). Any globals used by these functions could serve as loop counters or loop control flags; their declarations/usages are required to determine if a loop is well\u2011formed.\n\n- Prototypes/declarations for the above functions (if separate from bodies): To resolve parameter types and linkage, and to ensure we analyze the correct function signatures (types of loop counters/flags), have the declarations as well.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any for loops that affect, or are affected by, UtList_Add violate MISRA, you must inspect the bodies of its direct callees (and any objects those bodies reference). The listed symbols provide the code and type information required for that analysis."
