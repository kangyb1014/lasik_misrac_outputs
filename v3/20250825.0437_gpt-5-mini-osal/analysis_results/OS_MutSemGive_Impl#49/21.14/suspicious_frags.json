  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the provided code. The function only calls pthread_mutex_unlock and accesses object/table macros and fields; there are no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or other standard library functions that compare or operate on null-terminated strings. The variables (token, impl, impl->id) are not used as C strings, so Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for null-terminated string comparison) is not applicable to any fragment in this function."
