  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter itself. Reasoning:\n\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token; the code never assigns to token (no statements like token = ...), so the parameter variable is not modified.\n- The macro invocation impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_mutex_table, *token) expands to use &(*token) (because the macro uses &(tok)); &(*token) is equivalent to token, so this only reads the pointer and its pointee to compute an index \u2014 it does not modify the parameter.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const OS_object_token_t * and returns token->obj_idx, which only reads the object; it does not alter the pointer or the pointed-to object.\n- The assignment to impl stores a pointer into a local variable; this does not change the parameter.\n- The call to pthread_mutex_unlock(&(impl->id)) operates on the mutex object (impl->id), not on the function parameter. Modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule; the prohibition is only on modifying the parameter (the pointer) itself.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no additional fragments require investigation under this rule."
