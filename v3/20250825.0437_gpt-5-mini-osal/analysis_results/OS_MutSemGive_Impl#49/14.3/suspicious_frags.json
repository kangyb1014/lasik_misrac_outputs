  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The only conditional is\nif (status != 0)\nand status is assigned from pthread_mutex_unlock(status) immediately before \u2014 a runtime value, not a compile-time invariant. There are no loops or other if/switch statements with constant or invariant expressions in OS_MutSemGive_Impl. The related macros and helpers (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, token->obj_idx) perform index calculation and table access using runtime data (the token), not compile-time constants. Returns use defined constants (OS_SUCCESS, OS_SEM_FAILURE) but these are not controlling expressions. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
