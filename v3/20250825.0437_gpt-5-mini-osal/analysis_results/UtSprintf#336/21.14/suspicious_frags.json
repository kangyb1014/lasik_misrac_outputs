  "explanation": "I inspected the provided UtSprintf function and the related symbol definitions. There is no use of the Standard Library function memcmp (neither directly nor via a visible macro or wrapper) in the shown code. The function uses va_list, vsnprintf and accesses a static char buffer; none of these invoke memcmp or compare null-terminated strings with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other source files or macros not shown that might call memcmp, those would need to be examined, but based on the provided code no suspicious fragments exist."
