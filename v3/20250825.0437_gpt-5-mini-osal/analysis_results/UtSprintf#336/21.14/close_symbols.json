  "explanation": "Each symbol and why it's required for checking the MISRA rule (memcmp shall not be used to compare NUL-terminated strings):\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: Needed to know the exact definition of the buffer type used by UtSprintf. If the buffer's Text member is not a char array (or has unusual semantics) that affects whether returned data is a NUL-terminated C string and whether any comparisons could be string comparisons.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t.Text: The member type and length (e.g. char Text[N]) are required to determine whether vsnprintf will produce a NUL-terminated string in that storage and whether any subsequent comparisons could be of NUL-terminated strings. The array length also matters for whether truncation can occur.\n\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: The macro value affects the Buf array size and indexing logic; include it to ensure TextIndex wrap logic is correct and that Buf accesses cannot alias unexpectedly.\n\n- Buf (static UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf[UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS]): Although declared in the function, the analyzer needs the exact storage layout/definition to confirm what is returned (pointer into static storage) and whether that pointer could be compared as a NUL-terminated string elsewhere.\n\n- TextIndex: Its type/visibility/value semantics confirm the indexing into Buf and that the returned pointer is to a persistent static buffer (not ephemeral), which affects how and where memcmp might be used on returned strings.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): The type of TextIndex must be known to ensure the increment/wrap behavior is correctly interpreted (signed/unsigned width and overflow behavior can affect indexing and thus buffer returns).\n\n- vsnprintf: The implementation/semantics are required to confirm that the function writes a NUL terminator when space is available and that it does not itself perform comparisons using memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings in a way that would violate the rule in the translation unit's context (or that a platform-specific wrapper is not aliasing to a memcmp-based routine doing string comparisons).\n\n- va_list, va_start, va_end: These standard variadic helpers are used here. Their presence/definitions must be known to ensure no hidden macro/wrapper expands into code that uses memcmp for string comparisons.\n\n- memcmp: Include the memcmp symbol so the analyzer can search the translation unit, linked libraries, or any wrappers/macros for uses of memcmp that compare return values or Text buffers produced by UtSprintf. The MISRA rule targets use of memcmp for NUL-terminated strings, so the analyzer must detect any direct or indirect memcmp usage involving the buffers/returned pointer.\n\nNotes: The primary items to inspect are the buffer member definition (Text) and the vsnprintf implementation/wrappers. UtSprintf itself does not call memcmp, but an accurate determination requires checking the types/definitions above and any indirect calls (wrappers/macros) that could use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings returned from this function."
