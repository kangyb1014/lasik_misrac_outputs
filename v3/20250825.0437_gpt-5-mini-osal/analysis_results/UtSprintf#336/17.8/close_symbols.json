  "explanation": "- vsnprintf (declaration/prototype): needed to confirm the function signature (especially that the format parameter is declared as const char * and that the function will not modify the pointer argument itself). If vsnprintf is a macro or a wrapper on the target platform it might modify arguments in non\u2011standard ways, so the real declaration must be checked.\n\n- va_list (type): va_list is used to hold the variable-argument state. Its exact type/semantics (from <stdarg.h> or platform headers) are needed to inspect how va_start initializes it and whether that initialization could modify the named parameter Spec (some implementations depend on the last named parameter's address).\n\n- va_start (macro/implementation): va_start is a macro that uses the last named parameter (Spec) to set up the varargs pointer. To determine whether the operation constitutes modification of the parameter Spec on the target platform, the actual macro/implementation must be inspected.\n\n- va_end (macro/implementation): include va_end to verify its semantics and ensure it does not alter the value of the named parameter (or have side effects that would be considered modification of the parameter variable).\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (type/definition, including member Text): the struct/type defines Buf[].Text. Knowing whether Text is an array of char, a pointer, or an alias to some other storage is required to ensure there is no aliasing or indirect modification of the Spec pointer (for example, if Text were a pointer that aliasing Spec). It also helps verify that vsnprintf writes into an independent buffer and not into memory aliased with Spec.\n\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS (macro/value): needed to understand the wrap logic for TextIndex and to ensure Buf indexing is well-defined; also to check for any macro side effects (if it is defined as an expression or alias) that could affect or rebind Spec.\n\n- uint32 (typedef/definition): TextIndex is declared uint32; the typedef/definition is required to confirm its type/size and to inspect any unusual macro typedef that might expand in a way that touches function parameters.\n\n- Any macros/rewrites that redefine vsnprintf, va_start, va_end, or Spec: on some platforms or test frameworks these names may be macro\u2011replaced with custom implementations that could mutate the named parameter. All such redefinitions must be checked to be sure no code path in this function modifies the parameter variable Spec.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether any operation in UtSprintf (direct assignment, macro expansion, or called functions/macros) modifies the pointer parameter Spec itself (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
