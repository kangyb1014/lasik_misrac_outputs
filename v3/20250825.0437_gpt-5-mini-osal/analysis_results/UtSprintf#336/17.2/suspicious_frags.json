  "explanation": "Recursion (direct or indirect) can only occur via function calls made from within UtSprintf. The remaining fragments in the function (the static buffer declaration, the TextIndex increment and wrap, the return of the buffer pointer, and the UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS macro) do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves introduce self-calls; they are state/manipulation operations. va_start/va_end are standard macros for variadic argument handling and do not cause indirect recursion in normal implementations; the only call that could lead to indirect recursion is to the formatting routine (vsnprintf), which is included above for investigation. No explicit call to UtSprintf appears in the body (so there is no direct recursion present)."
