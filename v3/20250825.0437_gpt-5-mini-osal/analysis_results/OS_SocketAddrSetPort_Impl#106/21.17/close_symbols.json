  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can cause an out-of-bounds access (and thus to check the MISRA rule concerning string.h functions \u2014 here we must at least confirm there are no hidden string/memory functions and that the explicit memory writes are safe) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The full definition (layout) of the public socket address wrapper is required to know how large Addr->AddrData is and whether writing through the accessor can exceed the buffer embedded in OS_SockAddr_t.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The accessor type (likely a union/struct that overlays AddrData with sockaddr/sockaddr_in/sockaddr_in6) is required to know the field offsets and ensure that casting &Addr->AddrData to this accessor yields valid in-bounds accesses when assigning sin_port/sin6_port.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa.sa_family): The definition and offset of sa_family are needed to ensure the switch is reading a valid discriminant in-bounds of AddrData and to validate that the family value corresponds to the memory layout expected by the accessor.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (sa_in, sin_port): The layout and offset of sin_port within struct sockaddr_in are required to verify that Accessor->sa_in.sin_port is located inside the AddrData buffer and that assigning to it cannot write past the end.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sa_in6, sin6_port): Same reason as sockaddr_in but for the IPv6 case \u2014 needed if IPv6 support is enabled to check sin6_port location and size relative to AddrData.\n\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t) size/definition: Although part of OS_SockAddr_t, call out the concrete array size/type used for AddrData. The safety of the pointer cast and subsequent writes depends on this size being at least as large as the largest accessed sockaddr structure.\n\n- AF_INET: The constant value is needed only to map the switch case to the expected layout; verifying correct family value interpretation helps ensure the chosen branch accesses the correct overlay inside AddrData.\n\n- AF_INET6: Same as AF_INET for the IPv6 branch.\n\n- in_port_t: The type (size, signedness, and alignment) of sin_port/sin6_port is needed to ensure assignment of sa_port (result of htons) matches the destination field without unexpected widening or alignment issues that could lead to undefined behavior.\n\n- uint16 / uint16_t: Definition of the PortNum parameter type and its width is needed to confirm htons usage and that the conversion cannot produce data larger than the destination field.\n\n- htons: Declaration/semantics (return type and that it does not perform any hidden memory operations) are needed to ensure this call does not involve string.h functions or hidden memory copies that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: The compile-time macro determines whether the AF_INET6 branch is present in the compiled code; the analyzer must know whether that code path exists to include the sockaddr_in6 checks.\n\nNotes: The MISRA rule quoted specifically targets standard C string.h functions. This function does not call any string.h functions, but writing to fields within an overlayed buffer can still cause out-of-bounds memory writes. The symbols above are exactly those needed to verify that the pointer cast and the subsequent writes (sa_in.sin_port / sa_in6.sin6_port) are within the bounds of Addr->AddrData and that no hidden call to a string.h routine occurs (htons does not). Symbols such as OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS or OS_SUCCESS are irrelevant to the string.h rule and are not required for the bounds analysis."
