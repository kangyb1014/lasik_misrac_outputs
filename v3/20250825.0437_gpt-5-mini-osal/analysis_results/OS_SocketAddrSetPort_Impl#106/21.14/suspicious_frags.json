  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related definitions for any use of memcmp or any other byte-wise comparison functions used to compare null-terminated strings (e.g., memcmp, strcmp, strncmp). None are present. The function only: converts a numeric port with htons, casts the Addr->AddrData into an accessor union, switches on sa_family, and assigns numeric port fields (sin_port or sin6_port). The union contains a char data[] member but it is not used for any string comparison in the shown code. No calls to memcmp (or other string-comparison functions) occur in the target function or the supplied related definitions, so there are no code fragments that should be investigated for Rule 21.14 in the provided snippets."
