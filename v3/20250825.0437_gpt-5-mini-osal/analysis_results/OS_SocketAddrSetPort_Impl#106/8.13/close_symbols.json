  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule checking about pointer const-qualification you must know the exact types and qualifiers involved so you can tell whether the code (a) legally/illegally discards a const qualifier or (b) actually modifies an object and thus should not use a const pointer. Explanation of each required symbol:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (full struct/typedef): determines the type and qualifiers of the function parameter Addr and, crucially, the declaration of its member AddrData (whether AddrData is const-qualified). If AddrData is const, the cast to a non-const accessor would discard const (MISRA concern).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (full struct/typedef): shows the exact member types and any const qualifiers for the accessor used after the cast (sa, sa_in, sa_in6). Needed to see whether the code writes through a non-const pointer to data that might be declared const.\n\n- AddrData (member type within OS_SockAddr_t): if AddrData is, for example, an array of const bytes or a const-qualified buffer, the cast &Addr->AddrData to a non-const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t * would remove const \u2014 directly relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- struct sockaddr (or the type used for Accessor->sa) including sa_family field and its type: to confirm the sa_family member name/type and whether it (or the enclosing object) has any const qualifiers that affect writes.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (including sin_port field): to confirm sin_port member type and qualifiers (writing to sin_port is a mutation \u2014 if the underlying object is const-qualified this is a violation).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (including sin6_port field): same rationale as sockaddr_in for the IPv6 branch (and whether that write mutates a const object).\n\n- in_port_t typedef: to know the exact type assigned to sin_port/sin6_port and whether htons returns a matching non-const type (type mismatch/qualifier propagation can be relevant to const analysis).\n\n- uint16 (or underlying typedef, e.g., uint16_t): to confirm the PortNum parameter type and whether any implicit conversions affect const qualification (mainly completeness of type picture).\n\n- htons prototype/signature: to know its return type and qualifiers (mostly to ensure no const qualifiers are introduced/expected on the port value and to detect any casting of const-qualified values).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6 macros/values: to confirm which code paths are compiled/exercised; AF_INET6 presence plus OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 affects whether the IPv6 write is relevant.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 macro/definition: determines whether the AF_INET6 case exists in the build \u2014 needed to know which writes occur and thus whether the pointer must be non-const for those paths.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS and OS_SUCCESS constants: included to fully resolve the function return semantics (not directly about const, but necessary for complete analysis of effects and control flow).\n\nIn short: primarily you need the definitions of OS_SockAddr_t, its AddrData member type, and OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (and the referenced sockaddr{,_in,_in6} types and in_port_t) to determine if the code is casting away const or modifying an object that should be const-qualified. The other symbols (htons, numeric typedefs, AF_* macros, OS_* constants) complete the type/control-flow picture so the const-qualification analysis is accurate."
