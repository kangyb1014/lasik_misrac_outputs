True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe call passes a fixed-size local buffer (local_path) to OS_TranslatePath without providing its size. If OS_TranslatePath internally uses string.h functions that do not check bounds (e.g. strcpy, strcat, memcpy/memmove with an incorrect length), a long input path can cause writes beyond local_path (>= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN) and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. For example, if OS_TranslatePath uses strcpy(local_path, path) and path length >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, this will overflow the buffer.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nENTER OS_OpenCreate: filedes=0x55dd8b7c8608 path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8 flags=3 access_mode=2 local_path_size=128\nOS_OpenCreate: calling OS_TranslatePath(path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8, local_path=0x7ffee2309620)\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath returned -108\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath failed with -108\nEXIT OS_OpenCreate: returning -108 filedes=0\nENTER OS_OpenCreate: filedes=0x55dd8b7c8608 path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8 flags=3 access_mode=2 local_path_size=128\nOS_OpenCreate: calling OS_TranslatePath(path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8, local_path=0x7ffee2309620)\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath returned -108\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath failed with -108\nEXIT OS_OpenCreate: returning -108 filedes=0\nENTER OS_OpenCreate: filedes=0x55dd8b7c8608 path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8 flags=3 access_mode=2 local_path_size=128\nOS_OpenCreate: calling OS_TranslatePath(path=0x55dd8b7ab2b8, local_path=0x7ffee2309620)\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath returned -108\nOS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath failed with -108\nEXIT OS_OpenCreate: returning -108 filedes=0\n\n</execution_log>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not proven. The code in OS_OpenCreate does not itself call any <string.h> functions \u2014 it merely passes a fixed-size local buffer to OS_TranslatePath. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is concerned with uses of the string.h API that cause out-of-bounds accesses. Whether there is a violation depends on the implementation/contract of OS_TranslatePath: if that function ensures it never writes more than OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes (or returns an error when the translated path would be too long), then no Rule 21.17 violation occurs. The provided execution log even shows OS_TranslatePath returning an error (-108) rather than corrupting the stack, which is consistent with a bounds check in the callee. By itself, passing local_path without its size is a potential hazard but is not sufficient evidence of a MISRA 21.17 violation. To establish a definite violation you must inspect OS_TranslatePath (and any functions it calls) to see whether string.h routines are used without proper bounds checking. Recommendation: either (a) modify the API to pass the buffer length (e.g. OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path, sizeof local_path)), or (b) document and verify that OS_TranslatePath enforces the OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN limit and does not call string.h routines in a way that can overflow the buffer."
