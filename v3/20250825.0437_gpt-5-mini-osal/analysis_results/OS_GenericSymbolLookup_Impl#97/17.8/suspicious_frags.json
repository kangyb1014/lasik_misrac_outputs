  "explanation": "I reviewed all parameter usages in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself but allows modifying the object it points to. In this function:\n\n- There are no assignments to any parameter variables (no statements like dl_handle = \u2026, SymbolAddress = \u2026, or SymbolName = \u2026). The parameters themselves are never re-assigned.\n- The only write involving a pointer parameter is *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function; which modifies the object pointed to by SymbolAddress \u2014 this is explicitly allowed by the rule.\n- dl_handle and SymbolName are only passed to dlsym/dlerror and used for diagnostics; they are not modified. dlError and Function are local variables, not parameters.\n- The OS_DEBUG macro (defined empty here) only uses the parameters as arguments; passing a pointer as an argument does not modify the parameter itself.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing requires further investigation with respect to this rule."
