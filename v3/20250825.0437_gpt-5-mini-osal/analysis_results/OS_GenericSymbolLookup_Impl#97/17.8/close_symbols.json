  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl violates the MISRA rule \u201ca function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must ensure no macro or expansion inside the function assigns to the parameter variables (dl_handle, SymbolAddress, SymbolName). The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This is invoked with SymbolName and dlError. If OS_DEBUG is a macro (not a simple function) its expansion could reference or assign to the parameter identifiers (e.g. SymbolName). Inspecting its definition ensures it does not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- dlsym: This is used as dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName). If dlsym is implemented as a macro rather than a pure function, its expansion could modify the actual parameter variables (dl_handle or SymbolName). We need its definition to confirm it does not assign to those parameters.\n\n- dlerror: Called with no arguments but could be a macro whose expansion references or assigns to local/parameter names; examine its definition to ensure it doesn't modify parameters.\n\n- cpuaddr: The cast (cpuaddr)Function and the subsequent assignment *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function rely on the exact typedef/definition of cpuaddr. Knowing the type confirms that the code modifies the object pointed to by SymbolAddress (allowed) and not the pointer itself, and that no hidden behavior (e.g., complex macro typedef) could alter the pointer parameter.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: These identifiers are used to set status. If they are macros with side effects (unlikely but possible), their expansions could modify parameters or local variables. Verifying they are simple constants or enum values ensures no hidden parameter modification.\n\nInspecting these symbols (definitions/macros) is sufficient to conclude whether any parameter identifier is being assigned to or otherwise modified inside this function."
