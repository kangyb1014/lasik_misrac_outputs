  "explanation": "dlsym \u2014 Need the exact prototype (parameter and return const-qualification) to determine whether passing SymbolName (const char *) to dlsym discards a const qualifier and therefore violates the MISRA rule. POSIX dlsym returns void * and takes const char *; if the target environment differs that affects the analysis.\n\ndlerror \u2014 Need the prototype/return type to check const-qualification interactions (the code stores dlerror() result into a const char *). If dlerror returned non-const char * this assignment adds const (allowed); if it returned const char * that is also allowed. Exact declaration matters for MISRA analysis.\n\nOS_DEBUG \u2014 The declaration/signature (macro or function) is required to confirm whether passing SymbolName and dlError (both const char *) into OS_DEBUG drops const (e.g., if OS_DEBUG expects a char * rather than const char * or performs non-const operations). MISRA can be violated if a const-qualified pointer is passed to an API that requires a non-const pointer.\n\ncpuaddr \u2014 The typedef for cpuaddr is required to know what cpuaddr *SymbolAddress means (is cpuaddr an integer type, pointer type, etc.), and to determine whether casting a void * (Function) to cpuaddr and storing it via *SymbolAddress modifies constness or otherwise conflicts with const qualifiers.\n\nint32 \u2014 The typedef/definition of int32 is needed to ensure status handling or any implicit conversions do not interact with const qualifiers (primarily for completeness in type analysis of the function).\n\nOS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR \u2014 The definitions (macros/enum values) are needed only to fully understand status assignments/flow; while not directly const-related, including them ensures the analyzer has the full context of how status is used and whether any pointer constants depend on these values.\n\nNote: The critical symbols for the MISRA rule here are the exact declarations of dlsym, dlerror, and OS_DEBUG, plus the cpuaddr typedef. The rest are included for completeness so an analyzer has the surrounding type/constant context."
