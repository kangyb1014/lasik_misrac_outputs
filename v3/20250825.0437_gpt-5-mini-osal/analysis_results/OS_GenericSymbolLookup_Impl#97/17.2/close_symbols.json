  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion (MISRA rule), the analysis must examine all call paths into and out of the target function: \n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl: a direct caller of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. Any calls it makes to other functions could form an indirect path back to the target.\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: another direct caller of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. Its callees must be checked for paths that return to the target.\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: called by OS_SymbolLookup_Impl; it could (directly or via other functions) call back into OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, creating indirect recursion.\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: called by OS_SymbolLookup_Impl; include it for the same reason as above (possible callback path).\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: called by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; it could be part of a chain that leads back to the target.\n- OS_SymbolLookup: a higher-level caller of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl; include to inspect larger call chains that originate outside the Impl layer and might close a recursion cycle.\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup: a higher-level caller of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; include for the same reason as OS_SymbolLookup.\n\nBy inspecting these symbols (their callees and callers as needed), the next agent can trace all possible call paths to verify whether any path starting from or reaching OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl eventually calls it again (directly or indirectly)."
