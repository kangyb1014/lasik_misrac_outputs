  "explanation": "dlerror \u2014 need the prototype/definition and any attributes (e.g. noreturn) and documented runtime behavior (returns NULL or error string). If dlerror were declared noreturn or had side effects that alter control flow, that could make following code unreachable.\n\ndlsym \u2014 need the prototype/semantics (return value, side effects, possible exceptions). If dlsym had nonstandard attributes (e.g. aborts on failure) that would affect reachability of later branches.\n\nOS_DEBUG \u2014 this is a macro or function used in the two error branches. Its definition must be inspected because macros can expand to statements that change control flow (return, goto, exit, longjmp). If OS_DEBUG can transfer control out of the function, code after the call could be unreachable.\n\nOS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS \u2014 constant definitions for the status variable. While these values do not normally affect reachability, knowing their definitions is required to rule out any surprising macro expansions or expressions that might change control flow during assignment (e.g. if defined as function-like macros).\n\ncpuaddr \u2014 the typedef/definition used for casting and assignment to *SymbolAddress. If cpuaddr is a macro or unusual type that expands to code with side effects, that could affect reachability analysis.\n\nOS_SymbolLookup_Impl, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl, OS_SymbolLookup, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup \u2014 callers/related wrapper functions from the static call graph. To decide whether the target function (or any part of it) is unreachable in the project you must examine the call chain to see if the function is ever invoked. Provide these caller implementations to determine if the function itself is reachable from program entry points or other used APIs.\n\n(These are the minimal additional symbols required to decide whether any statements in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl can never be executed. Other standard macros such as NULL are assumed standard and need not be re-supplied unless project-specific overrides exist.)"
