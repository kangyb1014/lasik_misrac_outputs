  "explanation": "To decide whether the function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect all non-standard types, macros and external declarations used in the function body and their definitions: \n\n- int32: typedef for the function return type. If this typedef is defined using a compiler-specific extension (e.g. non-standard integer type, __int32, or unusual attributes) it would violate the rule. \n\n- cpuaddr: typedef for the SymbolAddress parameter and the cast target. The cast (cpuaddr)Function can be a portability/implementation issue; you must see the actual typedef to ensure it is a standard integer type (e.g. uintptr_t) and not a compiler-specific extension. \n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: these macros/constants determine control flow and may be defined using compiler extensions (e.g. __extension__, unusual attributes or non-standard constant expressions). Their definitions must be checked. \n\n- OS_DEBUG: macro used for error reporting. Macro definitions can hide language extensions (variadic macro syntax beyond the language standard, GCC-only __attribute__ usage, statement-expressions, inline assembly, or other extensions). Inspecting its definition is required to confirm no extensions are used. \n\n- dlsym and dlerror: external library functions called by the code. Their prototypes (and any accompanying macros used in their headers) must be checked because system headers sometimes use compiler-specific macros or attributes (for example __THROW, __attribute__, or other implementation-specific extensions). \n\n- dlfcn.h (declarations/macros used by dlsym/dlerror): explicitly inspect the header/declarations that introduce dlsym/dlerror in the build environment to ensure they do not employ compiler extensions (attributes, macros, or non-standard language constructs). \n\nChecking the above symbols and their definitions is sufficient to determine whether the target function relies on or hides any compiler language extensions."
