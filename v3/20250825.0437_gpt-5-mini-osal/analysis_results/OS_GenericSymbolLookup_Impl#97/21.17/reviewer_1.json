The code only checks the pointer for NULL (OS_CHECK_POINTER) but does not ensure the buffer is NUL-terminated or within bounds, so passing an unterminated or truncated buffer can lead to out-of-bounds accesses of objects referenced by pointer parameters to string.h functions.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl:\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32            status;\n    int32            local_status;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n\n    /* First search global table */\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* If not found iterate through module local symbols and break if found */\n    if (status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE, &iter);\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            local_status = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&iter.token, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n            if (local_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                status = local_status;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32                             status;\n    OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token);\n\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(impl->dl_handle, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    int32 staticsym_status;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolAddress);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * attempt to find the symbol in the symbol table\n     */\n    return_code = OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * If the OS call did not find the symbol or the loader is\n     * disabled, then check if a static symbol table is present\n     */\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL);\n\n        /*\n         * Only overwrite the return code if static lookup was successful.\n         * Otherwise keep the error code from the low level implementation.\n         */\n        if (staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            return_code = staticsym_status;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ModuleSymbolLookup(osal_id_t module_id, cpuaddr *symbol_address, const char *symbol_name)\n{\n    int32               return_code;\n    int32               staticsym_status;\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n    OS_object_token_t   token;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(symbol_address);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(symbol_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, module_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_global_module_table, token);\n\n        return_code = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&token, symbol_address, symbol_name);\n        if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            /* look for a static symbol that also matches this module name */\n            staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(symbol_address, symbol_name, record->name_entry);\n\n            /*\n             * Only overwrite the return code if static lookup was successful.\n             * Otherwise keep the error code from the low level implementation.\n             */\n            if (staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                return_code = staticsym_status;\n            }\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. Rule 21.17 from MISRA C 2023 is specifically about the use of the string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and requires that calls to those functions must not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl implementation does not call any of the listed <string.h> functions itself \u2014 it calls dlsym() and dlerror(), and uses an OS_DEBUG macro (which in the provided code is defined as a no-op). The indirect possibility that an underlying library implementation of dlsym/printf might internally call string.h routines does not constitute a direct use of the <string.h> functions in this translation unit and so does not by itself prove a violation of MISRA Rule 21.17.\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- The code does rely on the caller to provide a valid NUL-terminated string for SymbolName. The public entry points shown (OS_SymbolLookup and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup) do perform OS_CHECK_POINTER to ensure the pointer is non-NULL, but they do not validate that the buffer is NUL-terminated or within a particular length. This is a separate robustness / defensive-programming concern (and could be relevant to other MISRA rules about passing invalid pointers/objects to external APIs), but it is not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 as written.\n- If you want to be conservative, validate or document that SymbolName must be a valid NUL-terminated string before calling OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, or avoid using OS_DEBUG with %s unless the string is guaranteed terminated."
