  "explanation": "dlerror, dlsym: These library functions are called directly by OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule you must inspect the implementations (or wrappers) of these functions to see if they themselves call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings or perform any string comparisons that would trigger the rule. OS_DEBUG: This logging/debug macro/function is used for error messages that include SymbolName and dlerror() text; its definition could contain string-comparison usage (or expand to code that does), so it must be inspected for memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings. OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: These are the callers of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl and are the places where SymbolName (the string passed in) is created, validated, or manipulated. To judge whether any string comparisons involving SymbolName are done improperly (e.g., via memcmp on a null-terminated string) you must inspect these callers to see how they construct/pass SymbolName and whether they use memcmp on it. SymbolName: The actual string argument needs to be examined (or traced to its origin) to determine whether it is a NUL-terminated C string and whether any comparisons against it (in this function or in callees/callers) use memcmp improperly."
