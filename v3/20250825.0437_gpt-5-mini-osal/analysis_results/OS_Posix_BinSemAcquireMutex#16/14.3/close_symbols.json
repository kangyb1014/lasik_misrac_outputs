  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' you must determine whether the two if conditions can be compile-time or run-time invariant. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- clock_gettime: the controlling expression is (clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &timeout) != 0). You must see the declaration/definition (or any macro wrapper) to ensure clock_gettime is a true non\u2011constant function (has runtime-varying return) and not a macro/inline/constant that would make the test invariant.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: this macro/constant is passed into clock_gettime. Although it is a constant, its definition could indicate unusual macro behavior; include it to be certain the call expression is not rewritten to an invariant.\n\n- pthread_mutex_timedlock: the second controlling expression is (pthread_mutex_timedlock(mut, &timeout) != 0). You must inspect its prototype/definition or any macro wrapper to ensure it is not a compile-time constant or macro that yields an invariant result.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: the type of mut. If pthread_mutex_t is defined as a macro or as a type with unusual semantics (e.g. resolves to a constant handle), it could affect whether the timedlock call is invariant. Include the type definition to rule that out.\n\n- struct timespec: timeout is used and its fields are modified before timedlock. You need the struct timespec definition (types of tv_sec/tv_nsec) to ensure the addition of OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS does not create a compile-time constant or otherwise change whether the timedlock invocation is invariant.\n\n- OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS: used to modify timeout.tv_sec. While not part of the direct controlling expressions, its value could make the code behave deterministically in a way that affects the timedlock call; also check whether it is a macro that expands to an expression that could alter invariance analysis.\n\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE and OS_SUCCESS: these return values are used after the controlling expressions. Their definitions (macros/enum values) are needed to understand whether the comparisons to 0 and subsequent returns interact with any constant-folding or macro behavior that might render the controlling expressions invariant.\n\nIn short, you need the actual prototypes/definitions or macro expansions for the functions, the constants/macros used as arguments and return values, and the relevant type definitions to conclusively determine whether either controlling expression could be an invariant (constant) in the compiled code."
