  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions found. The only controlling constructs are two if statements: \"if (clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &timeout) != 0)\" and \"if (pthread_mutex_timedlock(mut, &timeout) != 0)\" \u2014 both depend on runtime function return values and therefore are not invariant. There are no loops in this function (so the rule exceptions for infinite loops or constant do-while are irrelevant). The use of the constant OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS (defined as 2) only appears in the assignment \"timeout.tv_sec += OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS;\" which is not a controlling expression. The macro return values (OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS) are constant but only used as return values, not as controlling expressions. Therefore no code fragments in the provided function require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
