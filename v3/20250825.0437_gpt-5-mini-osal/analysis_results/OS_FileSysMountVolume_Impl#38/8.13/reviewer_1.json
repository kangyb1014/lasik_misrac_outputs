In the function it is only used to read fields (local->system_mountpt, local->fstype, etc.) and never modified, so it could and should be declared as 'const OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local;'.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In this function the local variable is only used for read access (local->system_mountpt, local->fstype, etc.) and never modified, so it can and should be declared as a pointer-to-const (e.g. const OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local) to reflect intent and satisfy MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (which yields an OS_filesys_internal_record_t *) to a pointer-to-const is permitted (adding const), and making local const does not conflict with the calls made here (stat/mkdir take const char * and the array members decay to const char * from a const-qualified struct). Therefore the agent A's claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is justified."
