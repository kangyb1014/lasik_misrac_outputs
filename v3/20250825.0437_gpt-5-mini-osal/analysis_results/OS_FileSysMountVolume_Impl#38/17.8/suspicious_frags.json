  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter token (the pointer) in this function. The only use of the parameter is as *token in the call\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\nwhich dereferences the pointer to read the object value; this does not assign to or rebind the pointer variable token. There are no statements like token = ..., ++token, token += ..., or any other assignment that would change the pointer itself. The parameter type is const OS_object_token_t * so attempting to assign through *token would be a compile-time error, and there is no code here that attempts that. All other operations act on local, stat_buf, or filesystem calls (stat, mkdir, strerror) and do not modify the parameter. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
