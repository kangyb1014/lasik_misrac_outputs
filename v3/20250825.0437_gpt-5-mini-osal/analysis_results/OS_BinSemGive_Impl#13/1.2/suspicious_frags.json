  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code. I inspected the function and related definitions for common compiler-specific extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples checked):\n\n- GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, __asm__ / inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&label), or other vendor-specific keywords \u2014 none are present.\n- No asm statements, pragma extensions, or vendor-specific intrinsics are used.\n- Macros used (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) and usage of operators (&, [ ]) are standard C constructs; passing *token to the macro is valid C and not a language extension.\n- POSIX library calls and types (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_cond_t, pthread_mutex_timedlock, clock_gettime, struct timespec, sig_atomic_t) are part of POSIX, not compiler language extensions; they are not violations of MISRA Rule 1.2 as stated (the rule targets compiler language extensions documented as such).\n- Typedef names like int32 and the OS_* macros are project-defined types/macros, not compiler extensions; their use alone does not imply a language extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions must not be used). If you want, I can re-check if any project headers introduce compiler-specific extensions elsewhere (e.g., via macros expanding to __attribute__ or pragmas) \u2014 those would need the header sources to analyze."
