  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I inspected all provided code fragments (OS_BinSemGive_Impl, OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, and the declaration of OS_impl_bin_sem_table). None of these fragments contain any use of memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any other string-comparison function. The semaphore code manipulates integer fields (sem->current_value), pthread primitives (pthread_cond_signal, pthread_mutex_unlock, pthread_mutex_timedlock), and clock_gettime \u2014 none of which involve comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\nNote: The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is referenced but its definition was not provided; since its implementation is not in the supplied code, it cannot be analyzed here. If that macro (or any omitted code) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, it would be a violation, but there is no evidence of such use in the presented code fragments. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report from the given code."
