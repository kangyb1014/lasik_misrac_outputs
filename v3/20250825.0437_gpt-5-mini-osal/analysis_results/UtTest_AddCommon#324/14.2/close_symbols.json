Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether UtTest_AddCommon (including the behaviour of the functions it calls) violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule we must inspect any called code that can contain for statements and the data types those loops read or modify. The listed symbols are required for the following reasons:\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock: This callee may contain control-flow (including for loops) or call into OS_BSP_Lock_Impl; its body must be inspected for for-loops and loop-counter usage.\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl: Implementation called by UT_BSP_Lock; may contain for-loops whose counters/side-effects must be checked.\n- UT_BSP_Unlock: Like UT_BSP_Lock, this wrapper may contain loops or call into OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl that must be inspected.\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl: Implementation called by UT_BSP_Unlock; needs inspection for any for-loops and whether they obey the MISRA clauses.\n- UtList_Add: Directly called by UtTest_AddCommon and very likely to contain traversal/insert logic (for loops). Its implementation is the primary place to look for for-loops and any loop counters or loop-control flags.\n- UtList_GetHead: Callee of UtList_Add; may contain loops or affect objects used as loop counters/flags in the calling code.\n- UtList_NewNode: Callee of UtList_Add; may contain loops (e.g. memory initialization loops) or modify objects that appear in surrounding loops.\n- UtList_Insert_Before: Callee of UtList_Add; insertion logic may include loops that must be checked against the MISRA requirements (single loop counter, no modification of loop-controlled objects in body, etc.).\n- UtAssert_Global: The global whose DataBasePtr is passed into UtList_Add; its definition (type and the object pointed to) is required to understand what objects are being iterated/modified by UtList_Add and therefore whether loops use/modify objects improperly.\n- UtTestDataBaseEntry_t: Definition of the local struct copied into the list (including TestName array). Needed to check whether loops in the called list functions iterate over or modify fields of this structure (which would affect the rule about objects modified in the loop body).\n- Types and structure definitions used by UtList_* (list node/head types referenced by UtList_Add): The concrete list node and head types and their field definitions are necessary to determine which objects are loop counters, which are loop-control flags, and whether those objects are modified inside loop bodies called from UtTest_AddCommon.\n\nIn short: because UtTest_AddCommon itself contains no for loops, the rule compliance depends on the implementations of the functions it calls (and their callees) and on the definitions of the data structures those functions manipulate. The above symbols are the minimal set required to inspect those implementations and data types for MISRA for-loop well-formedness violations."
