Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtTest_AddCommon:\n```c\nvoid UtTest_AddCommon(void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void), const char *TestName,\n                      uint32 EntryType)\n{\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry_t UtTestDataBaseEntry;\n\n    memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test     = Test;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n    if (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtList_Add(UtAssert_Global.DataBasePtr, &UtTestDataBaseEntry, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t), EntryType);\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUT_BSP_Lock();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call to UT_BSP_Lock() in this context is not dead code: it pairs with UT_BSP_Unlock() around UtList_Add and is presumably required for synchronization or other side effects. Removing the call would change program behaviour (e.g. break thread-safety), so Rule 2.2 is not violated here (is_rule_violated = false). Specific violation scenario: if UT_BSP_Lock() is implemented as a no-op (e.g. an empty inline function or macro that generates no code and has no side effects) while UT_BSP_Unlock() is likewise a no-op, then the call would be executed but its removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 in that build/configuration the call would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
