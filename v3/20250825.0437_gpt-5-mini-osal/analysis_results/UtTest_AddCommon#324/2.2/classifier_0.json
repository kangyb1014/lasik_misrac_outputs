  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtTest_AddCommon:\n```c\nvoid UtTest_AddCommon(void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void), const char *TestName,\n                      uint32 EntryType)\n{\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry_t UtTestDataBaseEntry;\n\n    memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test     = Test;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n    if (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtList_Add(UtAssert_Global.DataBasePtr, &UtTestDataBaseEntry, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t), EntryType);\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment stores the Teardown function pointer into the local UtTestDataBaseEntry structure, which is then passed to UtList_Add (copied into the test database) and later used when the test is run. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (the stored Teardown pointer would be incorrect), so the statement is not dead code."
