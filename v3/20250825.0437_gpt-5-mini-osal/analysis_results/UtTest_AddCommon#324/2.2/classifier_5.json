  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtTest_AddCommon:\n```c\nvoid UtTest_AddCommon(void (*Test)(void), void (*Setup)(void), void (*Teardown)(void), const char *TestName,\n                      uint32 EntryType)\n{\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry_t UtTestDataBaseEntry;\n\n    memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test     = Test;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Setup    = Setup;\n    UtTestDataBaseEntry.Teardown = Teardown;\n    if (TestName != NULL)\n    {\n        strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName) - 1);\n    }\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtList_Add(UtAssert_Global.DataBasePtr, &UtTestDataBaseEntry, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t), EntryType);\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The memset call zero-initializes the local UtTestDataBaseEntry structure before selective field assignments and before passing the entire structure (sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry_t)) to UtList_Add. Removing the memset would leave other members (and padding) indeterminate and would change program behaviour (and could cause undefined behaviour). Also, initialization is not considered dead code per MISRA note 3. Therefore this operation is not dead code."
