  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 as follows.\n\n- The parameters Test, Setup and Teardown are function pointers. The rule targets the pointed-to type being const-qualified; functions cannot be const-qualified in C, so applying const to the function type is not meaningful \u2014 Rule 8.13 is not applicable to these function-pointer targets.\n\n- TestName is already declared as const char *TestName, so it conforms to the rule.\n\n- Calls to memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, ...) and strncpy(UtTestDataBaseEntry.TestName, TestName, ...) involve destinations that are intentionally modified; therefore the pointee types must be non-const for those uses and are not candidates for const qualification.\n\n- The local variable UtTestDataBaseEntry is a mutable object (stack instance) that is initialized and then copied/used; taking its address for operations that copy or modify it is appropriate and does not indicate a missing const qualification on the pointee type.\n\nThe UtList_Add call is flagged because it passes the address of a local object and a database pointer into an API where the parameter types (e.g., void * vs const void *) are not visible here; that API boundary should be reviewed to determine whether the pointer parameters should point to const-qualified types."
