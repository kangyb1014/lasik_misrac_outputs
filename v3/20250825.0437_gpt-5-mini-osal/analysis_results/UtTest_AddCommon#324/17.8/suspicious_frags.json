  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. Analysis by parameter:\n- Test, Setup, Teardown: These function-pointer parameters are only read and copied into fields of the local UtTestDataBaseEntry structure (UtTestDataBaseEntry.Test = Test; etc.). The parameter variables themselves are not assigned to or altered.\n- TestName: This const char * is only read (used as the source in strncpy). The code does not assign to TestName or modify the pointer; the pointee (the string) is not modified by this call.\n- EntryType: This integer parameter is only passed by value into UtList_Add; it is not modified.\nOther operations (memset on the local struct, UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, UtList_Add with a pointer to the local struct, and strncpy writing into the local struct's buffer) do not modify any of the function's parameters themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
