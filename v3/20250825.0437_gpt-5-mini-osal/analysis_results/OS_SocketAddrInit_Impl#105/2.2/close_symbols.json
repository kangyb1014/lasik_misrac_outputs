  "explanation": "For determining whether any operations in OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl constitute dead code (i.e., executed but removable without changing program behaviour) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why each is required:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t\n  - Definition/layout of the target Addr object (fields ActualLength, AddrData, total size). Required to know what memset(Addr,0, sizeof(OS_SockAddr_t)) and assignments (Addr->ActualLength) actually affect and whether those writes are later used.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t\n  - The accessor union/struct that maps AddrData to sa.sa_family. Needed to verify that Accessor->sa.sa_family writes change memory used elsewhere (i.e., whether that write is observable) and to confirm no padding/aliasing issues.\n\n- OS_SocketDomain_t\n  - The domain enum/typedef to know the full set of possible Domain values and determine whether some switch-case arms are unreachable or never chosen (dead).\n\n- OS_SocketDomain_INET and OS_SocketDomain_INET6\n  - The domain constant values used in the switch. Needed to determine which case labels are possible and whether any case (or default) is dead.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n  - The compile-time macro that controls presence of the IPv6 case. If undefined, the IPv6 code is not present at all (affects whether that code can be dead or simply absent). This affects dead-code determination.\n\n- sa_family_t and socklen_t\n  - Underlying typedefs used for sa_family and addrlen. Required to understand assignment types and whether writes are meaningful or truncated/aliased.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6\n  - Needed to evaluate sizeof(...) used to set addrlen and to understand what memory layout/size are being assigned into Addr->ActualLength (and whether those sizes are used elsewhere).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6\n  - Values assigned to sa_family; required to know whether the assignment to Accessor->sa.sa_family is meaningful (i.e., used later to distinguish address families) and thus not dead.\n\n- OSAL_SIZE_C\n  - Macro used when assigning Addr->ActualLength; must know if it changes the value or has side-effects (casts/annotations) that affect whether the assignment is necessary.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and OS_SUCCESS\n  - Return codes used by the function. Needed to reason about control-flow and whether the early-return (when addrlen==0) is ever taken or can be removed without effect.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrInit (implementation)\n  - The wrapper/caller of OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl. To decide if any writes in the Impl function are unused, we must examine how callers use the initialized Addr (e.g., whether they rely on ActualLength, sa_family, or zeroing).\n\n- OS_SocketAccept (implementation)\n  - Listed caller of OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl. Its implementation is needed to see how it constructs/passes Domain and how it uses the Addr after initialization (to determine if writes in the Impl are observable or removable).\n\n- OS_SocketAccept_Impl (implementation)\n  - A callee of OS_SocketAccept that may consume the initialized Addr or Domain; required to trace use-def chains to see if fields set by OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl are used later.\n\n- OS_CreateSocketName (implementation)\n  - Called by OS_SocketAccept (per call graph); may use Addr or its fields. Including it helps determine whether writes done in OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl are subsequently read and thus not dead.\n\nIn short: to decide dead code for the memset, the ActualLength assignment, the sa_family write, and the switch branches you must know the data layout and all call-site usage of Addr and Domain (including whether IPv6 case is compiled in). The listed type/constant/macro definitions and the caller/callee implementations are the minimal necessary symbols to perform that analysis."
