  ],
  "explanation": "Only the three call sites above need investigation because Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. The parameters of OS_mv are already const-qualified (const char *src, const char *dest), and there are no other pointer variables, pointer assignments, casts, or pointer arithmetic in this function. The local variable (int32 return_code) and the control-flow statements do not involve pointer types and therefore do not relate to Rule 8.13. Investigators should check the declarations/prototypes of OS_rename, OS_cp and OS_remove to ensure they accept const-qualified pointers; if those APIs take non-const char * parameters, that would be a potential MISRA 8.13 issue. No other fragments in this function warrant investigation for Rule 8.13."
