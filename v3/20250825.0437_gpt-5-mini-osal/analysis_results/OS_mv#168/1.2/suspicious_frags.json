  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs: function definition and calls, pointer-to-char parameters with const, local variable declaration, comments, conditional statements, and return. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, asm(...), __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, GCC/clang pragmas or extensions, or Microsoft-specific extensions. The identifier int32 is the only non-standard type name shown; however this is a user typedef (not a language extension) and cannot be classified as a compiler language extension from the snippet alone \u2014 verification of whether int32 is a plain typedef or a compiler-provided extension should be done by inspecting the relevant header/typedef. Likewise, OS_rename, OS_cp, OS_remove and OS_SUCCESS are user symbols and not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
