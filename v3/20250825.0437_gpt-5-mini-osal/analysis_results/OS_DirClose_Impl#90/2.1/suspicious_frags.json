  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to be statically unreachable. The function has a single, straight-line control flow: retrieve table entry (impl), call closedir(impl->dp), set impl->dp = NULL, then return OS_SUCCESS. There are no conditionals, loops, gotos, early returns, or code following a return that would create unreachable code. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array access using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token)) which simplifies to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token); OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is an inline accessor that returns token->obj_idx, so the macro usage here does not introduce unreachable code. Although runtime issues (for example, if token is NULL or impl->dp is NULL) could cause undefined behavior at execution, such runtime faults do not constitute statically unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 and therefore do not need investigation for this rule. The macro\u2019s use of &(tok) could be problematic if a non-lvalue were passed, but in this call the argument is *token (an lvalue), so that case does not apply here."
