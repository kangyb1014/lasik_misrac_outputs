  "explanation": "I searched the provided code for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string comparison of null-terminated strings (e.g., strcmp, strncmp, memcmp used on strings). The OS_DirClose_Impl implementation only calls closedir and sets impl->dp to NULL; the macros and inline function shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) simply compute an array index from a token and do not perform any memory or string comparisons. The struct and table definitions involve a DIR* and an index, not character buffers. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
