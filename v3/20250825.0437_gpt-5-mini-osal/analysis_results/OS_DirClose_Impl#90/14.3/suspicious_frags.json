  "explanation": "The only fragment that could hide an invariant controlling expression is the use of the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro invocation; its expansion is not provided and may contain loops or conditional controlling expressions that need inspection. All other code in the snippet does not contain controlling expressions and therefore does not fall under Rule 14.3: the function signature and local variable declaration are not controlling expressions; the closedir(impl->dp) call is a function call (no loop/conditional); the assignment impl->dp = NULL is a simple assignment; the return OS_SUCCESS; is not a controlling expression; and the additional symbol definition (DIR * dp = opendir(local_path)) is an initialization, not a loop or conditional. These other fragments therefore do not require investigation for Rule 14.3."
