  "explanation": "To determine whether the function violates the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible we must inspect the actual types and qualifiers involved and any casts that could remove const. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to see the top-level type of the Addr parameter and whether members (including AddrData) are declared with any const qualifiers. The const qualification of Addr propagates to its members so the exact declaration matters.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: required to check the target type of the Accessor pointer and to verify whether the cast to (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *) is preserving const correctness or hiding a qualifier discard.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t::AddrData (member type): the code takes &Addr->AddrData and casts it. We must know the declared type of AddrData (array/union/struct) and whether it is declared const to see if the cast discards const or not.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa) definition: Accessor->sa.sa_family is used in the switch; we need the definition to verify member types/qualifiers and that no qualifier conversion occurs when accessing nested members from a const-qualified containing object.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (sin_port) definition: Accessor->sa_in.sin_port is read; we must see the type of sin_port and whether reading it through a const accessor is valid (and whether any cast would drop const).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sin6_port) definition: same reason as sockaddr_in for the IPv6 branch (sin6_port).\n\n- in_port_t typedef: sa_port is declared as in_port_t; we must know the exact underlying type to check parameter types for ntohs and ensure no pointer const-qualification issues arise via implicit conversions.\n\n- uint16 typedef: the PortNum parameter type is uint16 *; knowing the exact typedef helps determine whether it could/should be const-qualified and whether assigning *PortNum = ntohs(sa_port) is allowed.\n\n- ntohs prototype: used to convert sa_port to host order; its prototype shows whether it takes its argument by value (no pointer const issues) and the return type that is assigned through the non-const PortNum pointer.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: conditional compilation controls whether the AF_INET6 branch exists; we must evaluate both compile-time configurations to see if any path introduces a qualifier discard.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: the constants determine which branch is selected; knowing them is necessary to reason about which member (sin_port vs sin6_port) is used and thus which definitions matter for const analysis.\n\nWith these symbols we can determine: (1) whether any cast from &Addr->AddrData to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t * drops const qualification, (2) whether Accessor should/should not be const, and (3) whether PortNum could legitimately be declared const (it cannot be because it is written). These are the pieces needed to assess compliance with the MISRA pointer-const rule for this function."
