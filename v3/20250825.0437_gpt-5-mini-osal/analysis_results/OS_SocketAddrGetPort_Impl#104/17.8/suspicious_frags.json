  "explanation": "No violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 were found in the provided function. The code does not modify any parameter variable itself: there are no assignments to PortNum or Addr (e.g. no statements like PortNum = ... or Addr = ...). The only write performed is *PortNum = ntohs(sa_port); which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter PortNum (this is allowed by the rule). The Addr parameter is declared const and is only read to obtain &Addr->AddrData; taking the address and casting to a local const pointer (Accessor) does not modify the Addr parameter. All other operations (reading sa_family, copying sin_port/sin6_port into a local sa_port, returns) do not modify function parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
