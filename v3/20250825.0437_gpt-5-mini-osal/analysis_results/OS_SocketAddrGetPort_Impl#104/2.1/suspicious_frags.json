  "explanation": "Only the explicit 'break;' immediately following a 'return' in the default switch arm is unreachable and needs investigation for Rule 2.1. All other statements in the function are reachable along at least one control-flow path: the Accessor assignment is executed before the switch; the AF_INET and (when OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined) AF_INET6 case arms assign sa_port and then break to continue execution; the final '*PortNum = ntohs(sa_port);' and 'return OS_SUCCESS;' are reached when a case arm executes. The conditional inclusion of the AF_INET6 case depends on the compile-time macro; when included it is reachable via AF_INET6, and when excluded it simply is not present (not unreachable code). No other statements in the function are provably unreachable, so no further fragments require investigation under Rule 2.1."
