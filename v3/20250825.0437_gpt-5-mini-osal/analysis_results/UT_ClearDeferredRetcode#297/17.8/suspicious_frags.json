  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter FuncKey is not assigned to or otherwise modified anywhere in the function body \u2014 it is only passed as an argument to UT_GetStubEntry. The only variable modified is the local pointer StubPtr, which is not a function parameter. Calls to UT_GetStubEntry and UT_ClearStubEntry operate on values/objects outside this function; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter would be permitted by Rule 17.8, but there is no pointer parameter here. Therefore there are no locations in this code that appear to violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else in the shown code requires investigation for that rule."
