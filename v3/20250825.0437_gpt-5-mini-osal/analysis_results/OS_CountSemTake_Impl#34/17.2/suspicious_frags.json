  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and related symbols for any direct or indirect self-calls: \n- OS_CountSemTake_Impl does not call itself. The only calls/uses inside it are sem_wait(...) and the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) macro.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to a lookup using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)), and the provided static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and does not call OS_CountSemTake_Impl or any other function that might call it.\n- sem_wait is a POSIX blocking call and is not defined in the shown code; there is no indication it would call back into OS_CountSemTake_Impl (no callbacks, function pointers, or signal handlers shown that could cause indirect recursion).\n- There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other constructs in the provided fragments that could create indirect recursion.\n\nGiven the provided code, there are no code fragments that exhibit direct or indirect recursion requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
