  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are unreachable and therefore none that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Reasoning: \n- The function contains a single conditional: if (sem_wait(&impl->id) < 0) { return OS_SEM_FAILURE; } followed by return OS_SUCCESS; Both return paths are reachable at runtime depending on the result of sem_wait, so there is no statically unreachable branch.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an address-of index expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]). In the present use (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token)) this expands to a valid address computation (&OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))]) and does not introduce any compile-time-constant false condition or dead code.\n- There are no conditional compilation blocks, labels, gotos, or code after an unconditional return in this function that would create unreachable statements.\n- Blocking behavior of sem_wait or runtime errors (e.g., invalid token leading to undefined behavior) are runtime issues but do not constitute statically unreachable code per Rule 2.1.\n\nGiven the provided definitions and the function body, no fragment appears to violate the \u201cno unreachable code\u201d requirement, so I return an empty list of suspicious fragments."
