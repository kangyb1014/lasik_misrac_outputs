  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_TaskDelay_Impl can violate the MISRA C string-bounds rule we must be sure the function and the symbols it uses do not (directly or indirectly) invoke or rely on any <string.h> functions or perform out-of-bounds pointer accesses. The following symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- clock_gettime: the function is called by OS_TaskDelay_Impl; we need its prototype/definition to check whether it or its wrappers use any string handling or cause object bound accesses.\n- clock_nanosleep: likewise called in the loop; its behavior and implementation must be known to ensure no string.h functions or out-of-bounds memory accesses are performed as part of the call.\n- struct timespec: the function manipulates members (tv_sec, tv_nsec); the layout/size and member types must be known to verify arithmetic on tv_nsec/tv_sec cannot overflow or produce out-of-bounds accesses (not a string API issue but relevant to memory safety analysis).\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC: constant passed to the time functions; include to identify which implementation of the time APIs is used (affects which underlying library code runs).\n- TIMER_ABSTIME: flag passed to clock_nanosleep; required to determine call semantics and whether any library code path could use string functions.\n- EINTR: used to test the return value of clock_nanosleep; include to ensure proper loop behavior and to understand error-handling paths (which could invoke other routines).\n- int32 / uint32: the function's parameter and return type aliases; needed to confirm sizes and signedness for arithmetic and return-value semantics (ensures no hidden casts lead to buffer/index issues).\n- OS_ERROR / OS_SUCCESS: returned values; include to understand error paths and whether any additional cleanup/handlers (outside this function) might be invoked that could use string APIs.\n- NULL: passed to clock_nanosleep; include to confirm pointer usage and ensure no accidental dereference or string operations on that argument.\n\nNo string.h functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, strlen, etc.) appear in OS_TaskDelay_Impl itself; these symbols are sufficient to check whether any called/related APIs or macros could bring in string handling that would lead to out-of-bounds accesses."
