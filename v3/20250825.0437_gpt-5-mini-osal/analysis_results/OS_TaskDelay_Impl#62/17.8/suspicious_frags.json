  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters (the parameter object itself); pointer-referred objects may be modified but the pointer shall not be modified. In OS_TaskDelay_Impl the sole parameter is 'uint32 millisecond'. The code only reads 'millisecond' in expressions (millisecond / 1000, millisecond % 1000) and does not assign to it or apply ++/+=, so the parameter is not modified. The function calls clock_gettime(..., &sleep_end) and clock_nanosleep(..., &sleep_end, NULL) pass the address of the local variable 'sleep_end' so the called functions may modify that object \u2014 this is permitted by the rule. No pointer parameter variable is modified in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
