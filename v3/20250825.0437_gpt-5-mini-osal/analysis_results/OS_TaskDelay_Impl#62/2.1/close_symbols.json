  "explanation": "To determine if any part of OS_TaskDelay_Impl is unreachable under realistic definitions/values, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why they matter:\n\n- clock_gettime: Prototype/semantics are required to know whether it can modify sleep_end in a way that affects later control flow (e.g., whether it can fail or sets errno) and to confirm that its return behavior doesn't make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- clock_nanosleep: Its prototype and documented return-value semantics are essential. The loop condition depends on clock_nanosleep returning EINTR on interruption and 0 on success (or other non-zero error codes). If its return values differ from expectations (for example if success == EINTR or always non-zero), the loop or the code after it could become unreachable.\n\n- struct timespec: The field types and range of tv_sec/tv_nsec are needed to ensure the arithmetic (tv_sec += millisecond/1000; tv_nsec += 1000000 * (millisecond % 1000); and the carry adjustment) is well-formed and cannot trigger undefined behaviour that would make later code unreachable.\n\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC: Value is not normally relevant for reachability, but its definition is needed to ensure it does not expand to an expression that changes control flow (e.g., an unusual macro). Also needed to confirm correct use with clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep.\n\n- TIMER_ABSTIME: As with CLOCK_MONOTONIC, its definition must be checked to ensure it is a plain constant flag and not something that could affect control flow or produce compile-time constant conditions making code unreachable.\n\n- EINTR: The numeric value of EINTR (and its identity as an error code) is critical because the do/while loop repeats while (status == EINTR). If EINTR were defined as a value that makes the condition always true/false given clock_nanosleep semantics (e.g., EINTR == 0), the loop behavior and reachability of the return statements would change.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: Their definitions (macros/enum/values) are required because they appear in the final return statements. If either expands to a more complex construct or to the same value, or if one equals the other, it could indicate dead/unreachable branches or meaningless conditional results.\n\n- int32 and uint32: The typedefs/definitions are required to confirm range/representation and to ensure the arithmetic on 'millisecond' cannot produce undefined behaviour (e.g., overflow) that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n(Headers that typically contain these symbols: <time.h> for timespec/clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep/CLOCK_MONOTONIC/TIMER_ABSTIME, <errno.h> for EINTR, and the project's OS header(s) for OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS and int32/uint32.)"
