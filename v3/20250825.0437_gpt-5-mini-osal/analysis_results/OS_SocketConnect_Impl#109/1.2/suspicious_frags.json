  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs and well-known POSIX socket APIs, not language extensions. Specific points checked:\n\n- No GCC/Clang-specific keywords or built-ins (no __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __asm, etc.).\n- No statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions (a common GCC extension).\n- No nested functions or labels-as-values (GCC extensions).\n- No use of C preprocessor tricks that rely on nonstandard behaviour; the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to standard C expressions and is valid when passed *token.\n- Variadic macro (OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) is a standard C99 feature, not a compiler extension.\n- Use of POSIX types and APIs (socklen_t, connect, getsockopt, select, errno, strerror) are platform/OS APIs, not C language extensions; they should be assessed for portability but do not violate MISRA C Rule 1.2 which targets compiler language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments here that need to be reported for possible use of compiler language extensions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
