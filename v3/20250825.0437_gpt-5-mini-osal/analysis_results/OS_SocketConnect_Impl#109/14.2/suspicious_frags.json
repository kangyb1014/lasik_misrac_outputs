First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected all of the provided code fragments (OS_SocketConnect_Impl, OS_SelectSingle_Impl, the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, macros, typedefs and related definitions). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies to for statements. None of the supplied code contains any for statement or macros that expand to a for loop: the control structures present are switch, if/else and calls to functions (e.g. OS_SelectSingle_Impl, OS_DoSelect), and the macros shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_DEBUG) do not introduce for loops. Therefore there are no for-loop-related fragments to flag for investigation in the provided code. If you want rule 14.2 checked across additional files (for example the implementation of OS_DoSelect or other referenced code not supplied here), please provide those sources so they can be reviewed for for-loop compliance."
