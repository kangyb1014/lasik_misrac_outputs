  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In this function the local variable impl is only used for read-only access (impl->selectable and impl->fd are only read), so it can and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The existing code already uses const qualification for other read-only pointers (e.g. sa), which reinforces that impl could be const here. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (presumably returning a non-const pointer) to a const-qualified pointer is allowed in C (adding const), so there is no technical obstacle in this function to make impl const. The only reason not to change it would be some external constraint (e.g. a macro or API that requires the exact non-const type), but none is visible in the provided code. Therefore the agent A report that this code violates Rule 8.13 is correct."
