  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_SocketConnect_Impl the local variable impl is only used for read-only access (impl->fd and impl->selectable) and is never modified in this function. MISRA C 2023 R8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Therefore impl should be declared as a pointer to const, e.g. const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...);. (Assigning the macro result to a pointer-to-const is valid in C; there is no evidence here that the pointed-at object must be modified or that a non-const pointer is required by later calls.)"
