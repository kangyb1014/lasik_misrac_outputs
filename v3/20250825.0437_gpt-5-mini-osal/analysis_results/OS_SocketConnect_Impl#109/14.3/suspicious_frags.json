  "explanation": "I have listed all controlling constructs in the function (the switch and every if-condition). These are the only control expressions present in the provided function; there are no loop controlling expressions (while, do..while, for) or other conditional constructs omitted. Non-control statements (assignments, declarations, calls, returns, comments) are not relevant to MISRA Rule 14.3 and therefore were not included. The listed items should be investigated to determine whether any of them can be invariant (constant) in some build/configuration or execution path. No other control expressions exist in the function to be reported."
