  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtAssert_EndTest:\n```c\nvoid UtAssert_EndTest(void)\n{\n    uint32                 Ct;\n    bool                   SegmentValid;\n    UtAssert_TestCounter_t Local_SegmentCounters;\n    char                   Local_SegmentName[sizeof(CurrentSegment)];\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n\n    SegmentValid = (UT_SegmentCounters.TotalTestCases > 0);\n    if (SegmentValid)\n    {\n        ++UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount;\n        UT_SegmentCounters.TestSegmentCount = UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount;\n        UT_TotalCounters.TotalTestCases += UT_SegmentCounters.TotalTestCases;\n        for (Ct = 0; Ct < UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX; ++Ct)\n        {\n            UT_TotalCounters.CaseCount[Ct] += UT_SegmentCounters.CaseCount[Ct];\n        }\n        memcpy(&Local_SegmentCounters, &UT_SegmentCounters, sizeof(Local_SegmentCounters));\n\n        /*\n         * note, strcpy is OK because both are fixed size buffers of the same size,\n         * and the null termination on CurrentSegment was locally enforced already\n         */\n        strcpy(Local_SegmentName, CurrentSegment);\n    }\n\n    memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters));\n\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n\n    if (SegmentValid)\n    {\n        UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport(Local_SegmentName, &Local_SegmentCounters);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        UT_BSP_DoText(UTASSERT_CASETYPE_END, \"No test cases\\n\");\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtAssert_EndTest:\nUtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_TotalCounters   = {0}\n...\nUtAssert_TestCounter_t UT_SegmentCounters = {0}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    uint32 TestSegmentCount;\n    uint32 TotalTestCases;\n    uint32 CaseCount[UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX];\n} UtAssert_TestCounter_t\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nuint32                 Ct;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the declared variable Ct is used as the sole loop counter. The for statement uses Ct = 0 in the first clause (which sets the loop counter), Ct < UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX in the second clause (no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter), and ++Ct in the third clause (which only modifies the loop counter). Ct is not modified in the loop body. Declaring Ct as uint32 before the loop does not by itself violate Rule 14.2."
