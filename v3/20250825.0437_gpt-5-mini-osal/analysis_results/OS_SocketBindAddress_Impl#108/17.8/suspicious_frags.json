  "explanation": "Both function parameters are pointer types: 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and 'const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr'. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter variables themselves (e.g., assigning to or performing pointer arithmetic on the parameter identifiers). In this function there are no assignments to 'token' or 'Addr', no increments/decrements, and no taking of their addresses. The code only reads '*token' and reads fields via 'Addr->AddrData' and takes the address of that member into a local pointer 'sa' (a non-parameter local variable). The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is invoked with '*token' (a read), not with 'token' as an lvalue, and bind() is called with 'sa' (a local const pointer) \u2014 none of these modify the parameter identifiers. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate Rule 17.8 and no code fragments need further investigation for this rule."
