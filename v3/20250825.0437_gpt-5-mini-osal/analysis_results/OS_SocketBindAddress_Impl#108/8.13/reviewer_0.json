True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'impl' is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) but in this function it is only used for read access (impl->fd is read to call bind). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Declaring it as 'const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl' would satisfy the rule. Therefore this code fragment violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In this function the local pointer 'impl' is only used to read impl->fd to pass to bind; there are no modifications to the pointed-at object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so declaring the local as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl (or otherwise using a const-qualified type) would be appropriate. There is no apparent reason here that prevents making it const (assigning a non-const T* to a const T* is allowed), so the current non-const declaration violates the rule in this context."
