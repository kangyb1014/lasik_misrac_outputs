  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (typically in loops or conditionals that are constant at compile-time). The provided function contains no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) and thus no candidate loop controlling expressions. The conditional/switch expressions that do exist \u2014 switch(sa->sa_family), if (addrlen == 0), and if (os_result < 0) \u2014 all depend on runtime values (the contents of Addr->AddrData and the return value of bind), so they are not invariant. The #ifdef around AF_INET6 is a compile-time conditional that does not create an invariant controlling expression in the source logic. The do-while exception is not applicable because there is no do-while loop. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
