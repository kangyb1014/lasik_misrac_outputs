  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not proven correct from the snippet alone. MISRA 8.13 requires a pointer parameter to be const-qualified when the function (and any callees it forwards the pointer to) do not modify the pointed-to object. In OS_mkfs the parameter address is not modified locally, but it is passed to OS_FileSys_Initialize. Whether OS_mkfs should declare address as const char * depends on the prototype/semantics of OS_FileSys_Initialize: if that routine accepts/needs a non-const pointer or may modify the buffer, then OS_mkfs must keep char * and there is no MISRA violation; if OS_FileSys_Initialize does not modify the buffer (and its prototype can accept const), then OS_mkfs should be changed to const char * and the current code would violate 8.13.\n\nThe provided runtime log (address remains NULL before/after) is not definitive proof that the pointer/contents are never modified in all cases. To determine conclusively, inspect the declaration and implementation of OS_FileSys_Initialize and any other callers: if none modify the pointed-to object, change the parameter to const char * (and adjust callees) to satisfy MISRA 8.13."
