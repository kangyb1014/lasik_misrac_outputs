  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the non-const parameter 'address' is appropriate for mkfs because the function (or the called OS_FileSys_Initialize) is expected to write/initialize filesystem data at that memory/device address. The other pointer parameters (devname, volname) are already const. (A violation would occur if 'address' is never modified and could be declared 'const char *', but given the mkfs semantics it is reasonable and necessary to keep it non-const.)"
