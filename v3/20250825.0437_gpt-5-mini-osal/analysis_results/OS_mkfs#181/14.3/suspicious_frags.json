  "explanation": "I inspected all controlling statements in the provided code and found no invariant controlling expressions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\nChecked control points and reasons they are not invariant:\n- if (return_code == OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE || return_code == OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS): return_code is a variable set by OS_FileSys_Initialize, so the expression is not invariant.\n- if (fsdevname[0] == 0 || fsvolname[0] == 0): depends on input strings, not invariant.\n- if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) (several occurrences): return_code is a runtime result from functions, not invariant.\n- if (filesys->fstype == OS_FILESYS_TYPE_UNKNOWN && (filesys->address != NULL || strncmp(...) == 0)): depends on runtime-available fields and strncmp result, not invariant.\n- if (should_format): should_format is a function parameter (runtime value), not an invariant constant.\n\nNo do-while loops with constant controlling expressions or explicit infinite loops are present. The macros referenced (e.g., OS_CHECK_STRING) are used for parameter checking and do not introduce obvious invariant controlling expressions in the visible code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
