  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns pointer usage and const qualification. In this function the only places that involve taking the address of an object (and thus producing a pointer) are the two calls that pass &token and the declaration of the token object itself, so these fragments should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to type could be const-qualified. Other fragments do not involve pointers or const qualification concerns: the function parameter sem_id is passed by value (not a pointer), return_code is a scalar local variable (not a pointer), the return statement returns an int32 value, and the comment and function signature contain no pointer-compatible expressions \u2014 therefore they do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
