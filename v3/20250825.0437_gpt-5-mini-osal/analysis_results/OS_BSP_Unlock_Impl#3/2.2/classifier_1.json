  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The code does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The only operations actually executed are the call to pthread_mutex_lock, the comparison (status < 0) and, on success, pthread_setcancelstate. The BSP_DEBUG macro expands to nothing, so there is no executed debug call to be removed. Note also that pthread_mutex_lock returns 0 on success and positive error numbers on failure, so the status < 0 branch is effectively unreachable \u2014 but per MISRA Note 2 unreachable code is not considered dead code. Therefore there is no executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, and Rule 2.2 is not violated."
