  "explanation": "- pthread_mutex_unlock (declaration): need the prototype to know the parameter type (pthread_mutex_t * vs const pthread_mutex_t *) so we can determine whether passing &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex requires a non-const pointer (i.e. is mutable) or would violate a const qualification rule.\n- pthread_setcancelstate (declaration): the prototype (int pthread_setcancelstate(int, int *)) is required to check whether any pointer parameters are involved and whether any const qualification should apply; even though the code passes an int and NULL, the declaration confirms whether a pointer constness issue could arise.\n- strerror (declaration): its return type (char * vs const char *) is central to the MISRA rule here \u2014 we must know whether the library declares it as returning a non-const pointer (modifiable) or a const-qualified pointer to determine if the call and subsequent use (passing into BSP_DEBUG) violates the \"pointer should point to const whenever possible\" guidance.\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro or function prototype): need the parameter types (e.g., does it take const char * for the format and argument strings?) to know if passing strerror(...) (whose return type we must know) results in passing a non-const pointer to a parameter that could/should be const.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (definition of the global struct): must know the exact types of AccessMutex and AccessCancelState to judge whether taking &AccessMutex produces a pointer that should be const-qualified and whether AccessCancelState's use is relevant to pointer constness.\n- pthread_mutex_t (type): included explicitly to be certain of the mutex type details (is it an opaque type that must be modified by pthread_mutex_unlock?) and to verify whether the mutex parameter is legitimately non-const (i.e., unlocking modifies internal state) so no const qualification is appropriate.\n\nThese symbols provide the declarations and type information needed to decide whether pointers in OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl should have been declared const (or are correctly non-const), and thus whether the code violates the MISRA rule about const-qualified pointer types."
