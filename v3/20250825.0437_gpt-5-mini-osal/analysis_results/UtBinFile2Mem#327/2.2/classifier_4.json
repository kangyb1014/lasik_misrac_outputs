  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtBinFile2Mem:\n```c\nbool UtBinFile2Mem(void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n    bool  Success;\n\n    Success = false;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        if (fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) == 1)\n        {\n            Success = true;\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        UtAssert_Failed(\"UtBinFile2Mem: Error Opening %s: %s\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtBinFile2Mem:\n#define UtAssert_Failed(__VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(false,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The function UtAssert_GetContext() is called via the UtAssert_Failed macro (used in UtBinFile2Mem). It returns DefaultContext and is therefore executed; removing the function or the call would change program behavior. Although it simply returns a constant, it is not dead code because it is referenced and invoked."
