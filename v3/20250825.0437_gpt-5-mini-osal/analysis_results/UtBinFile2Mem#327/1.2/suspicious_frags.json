  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no vendor-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __typeof__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions.\n- The variadic macro usage (UtAssert_Failed(__VA_ARGS__)) is a standard C feature since C99 and is not a compiler extension in modern C compilers that implement the C99/C11 standards.\n- The use of bool/true/false is the standard _Bool/bool facility from C99 (or could be a typedef in the project); this is not a language extension by itself.\n- Standard library calls (fopen, fread, fclose, strerror, errno) are all standard C library functions, not extensions.\n- The typedef of uint32 from uint32_t is standard typedef usage (the truncated snippet shown does not introduce any compiler extensions).\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that specifically indicate the use of compiler-documented language extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. If you want, I can re-check if the project uses nonstandard compiler flags or headers that were not included here (those could enable/introduce extensions)."
