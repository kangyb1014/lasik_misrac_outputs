  "explanation": "UtAssert_Failed \u2014 The else-path calls UtAssert_Failed. To decide reachability you must know whether this symbol is a normal returning function or a non\u2011returning function (e.g. marked noreturn / calls abort/exit/longjmp). If it never returns, certain code paths following that call could be unreachable in that control flow.  UtAssert_GetContext \u2014 the provided static call graph shows UtAssert_GetContext as a callee related to the assert machinery; the assert macros/implementations may expand/call this helper and its behavior (returning vs non\u2011returning) can affect reachability analysis of the assert/else path.  fopen \u2014 The if/test is based on fopen(Filename, \"r\"). To determine whether the if/else branches are both potentially reachable you must know whether fopen is the standard implementation or a project stub/macro that could be defined to always return NULL or always return a valid FILE* (which would make one branch provably unreachable).  strerror \u2014 Called as an argument to the assert; while unlikely to be non\u2011returning, a project could replace it with a macro/impl that affects control flow. Include it to rule out any non\u2011returning behavior that could affect reachability.  errno \u2014 Used in the assert message; its definition (macro/global) should be checked to ensure it does not hide control\u2011flow effects (e.g. being implemented via a function-like macro that does longjmp/abort).  (Only these symbols are required to establish whether any statements in UtBinFile2Mem are provably unreachable. Other standard I/O functions used inside the true branch \u2014 fread, fclose \u2014 do not affect the reachability of the branches unless they themselves are replaced by non\u2011returning stubs; if that is a concern, include them similarly.)"
