  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains ordinary, reachable control flow constructs (the fopen/fread/fclose sequence, the Success variable assignment and the conditional that sets Success = true). These do not themselves create unreachable code under standard C semantics. The only potential source of unreachable code is whether UtAssert_Failed (which expands to a call to UtAssertEx) is a non-returning assertion handler (e.g. aborts, longjmps, or is marked noreturn). If UtAssert_Failed/UtAssertEx does not return, then the subsequent code (notably the final \"return Success;\") becomes unreachable. UtAssert_GetContext (provided) simply returns a context and does not affect reachability. Therefore investigation should focus on the implementation/attributes of UtAssertEx (and any platform-specific attributes that could make the macro call non-returning); no other fragments in the shown code indicate unreachable code."
