  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: \n- const char *Filename is already const-qualified and therefore conforms to the rule.\n- The local FILE *fp variable and its uses (fopen, fread, fclose) deal with the standard C FILE type, which is an opaque, mutable stream object; those APIs require FILE * (not pointer-to-const) and fp is used for I/O operations, so making them point-to-const would be inappropriate.\n- The call to fread(Memory, Length, 1, fp) uses Memory as a destination buffer; it must be a modifiable (non-const) pointer because data are written into it.\n- The string literal in the UtAssert_Failed call is a literal token (no pointer declaration to adjust) and its usage in the format string is conventional; MISRA 8.13 targets pointer declarations/definitions rather than literal tokens.\n- Scalar parameter Length and the return type (bool) are non-pointer types and not relevant to this rule.\nThese items therefore do not require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
