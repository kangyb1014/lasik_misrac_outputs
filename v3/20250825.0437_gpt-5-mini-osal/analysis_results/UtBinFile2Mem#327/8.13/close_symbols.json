  "explanation": "- fopen: its prototype (FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode)) shows that Filename is passed to a function expecting const char *. Verifying this prototype confirms whether Filename being const-qualified is appropriate.\n- fread: its prototype (size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)) is essential because the first parameter is void * (non-const). This demonstrates that Memory is written-to by fread, so Memory must not be const-qualified.\n- fclose: its prototype (int fclose(FILE *stream)) and use of FILE ensure the FILE type and stream handling do not impose any additional const qualification requirements on Memory or Filename.\n- strerror: its prototype (char *strerror(int errnum)) and return type are needed because its return is passed into UtAssert_Failed. Knowing whether strerror returns const char * or char * affects whether passing its result would conflict with const qualification rules.\n- errno: the declaration/type of errno (typically an int lvalue) is required to understand the use of strerror(errno) and any const-related semantics for the error string retrieval.\n- FILE (typedef): the definition/type of FILE is required because fopen/fread/fclose use it; this confirms the expected pointer types for stream operations.\n- size_t (typedef): fread uses size_t for size/nmemb parameters; knowing size_t helps verify compatibility with uint32 and whether any implicit conversions affect const correctness (though not pointer constness directly).\n- uint32 (typedef): the definition of uint32 used by the target function is needed to check whether using uint32 for the size argument is appropriate and to rule out any API mismatch that might influence whether pointers should be const.\n- UtAssert_Failed: the prototype (e.g., void UtAssert_Failed(const char *fmt, ...)) is required to confirm what argument types it expects (especially whether format and string arguments are const-qualified) when Filename and strerror(...) are forwarded to it.\n\nThese symbols provide the function prototypes and type definitions necessary to determine whether pointers passed into or returned from library/utility calls are expected/should be const-qualified, and to confirm that Memory is legitimately non-const because it is written to by fread."
