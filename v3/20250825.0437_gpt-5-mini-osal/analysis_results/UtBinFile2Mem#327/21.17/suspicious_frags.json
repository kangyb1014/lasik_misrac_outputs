  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The only use of a <string.h> function in this code is strerror in the UtAssert_Failed call, so that line must be investigated for potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds/string handling issues (and for correctness when Filename may be NULL). Other lines do not call any <string.h> functions: fopen/fread/fclose are stdio functions (not covered by Rule 21.17), and the calls to fread and the handling of Memory/Length relate to I/O/buffer sizing rather than string.h functions. The UtAssert_Failed macro expansion itself does not introduce additional <string.h> calls beyond the shown call to strerror. Therefore no other fragments are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
