  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The code contains several conditional statements, but each depends on a variable or function return value that can vary at runtime: \n- In OS_BinSemGive: if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) \u2014 return_code was assigned from OS_ObjectIdGetById(...), a function call, so the expression is not a compile-time constant.\n- In OS_ObjectIdGetById: if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), and if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) \u2014 return_code is set by calls to OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, and OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, so these checks are dynamic.\n- In OS_BinSemGive_Impl: if (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(&sem->id) != OS_SUCCESS) \u2014 this depends on the runtime return value of OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex.\n\nThere are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions, no if statements with literal constants like if (1) or if (0), and no switch statements with invariant conditions. The use of the OS_SUCCESS macro (defined as 0) does not make the controlling expressions invariant because it is being compared against runtime values. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
