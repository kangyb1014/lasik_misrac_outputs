True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer UtTestDataBaseEntry is declared as a non-const UtTestDataBaseEntry_t * and is assigned from UtList_GetObject(UtListNode). In the shown code the object is only read (TestName read, function-pointer members invoked) and never modified via this pointer, so the pointer could (and per MISRA 8.13 should) be const-qualified. If UtList_GetObject currently returns a non-const pointer, either the assignment or the declaration is a violation: UtTestDataBaseEntry should be declared as const UtTestDataBaseEntry_t * (or UtList_GetObject should provide a const-qualified return) to comply with Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<execution_log>\nThe agent A also provided the following output log:\nUtTest_Run: entered.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In UtTest_Run the local pointer UtTestDataBaseEntry is only used to read fields and to call function-pointer members; it is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so UtTestDataBaseEntry should be declared as const UtTestDataBaseEntry_t * (or alternatively UtList_GetObject should be changed to return a pointer-to-const). Assigning the non-const return of UtList_GetObject to a const-qualified local pointer is allowed (qualifier addition), so making the local pointer const is the proper fix. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is correct."
