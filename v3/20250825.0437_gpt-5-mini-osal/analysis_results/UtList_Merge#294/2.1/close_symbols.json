  "explanation": "To decide whether UtList_Merge is unreachable (violates the MISRA rule), you must examine its call chain and any code that can prevent its call from executing. Reasons each symbol is required:\n- UtTest_Run: direct caller of UtList_Merge (per the call graph). You must inspect UtTest_Run source to see the exact call site and whether that call is inside conditionals, behind early returns, or otherwise unreachable.\n- OS_Application_Run: caller of UtTest_Run. If UtTest_Run is never invoked at runtime, UtList_Merge may be effectively unreachable. You need OS_Application_Run to determine whether it invokes UtTest_Run in reachable code.\n- main (program entry / startup): to determine whether OS_Application_Run itself is ever invoked from program startup; if the program entry point never reaches OS_Application_Run, the whole chain may be unreachable.\n- OS/task startup or registration function(s) that invoke OS_Application_Run (e.g. OS_TaskCreate/AppMain): in many embedded/OS designs OS_Application_Run may be scheduled/registered rather than directly called from main; these symbols (or their implementations) must be checked to determine actual runtime invocation.\n- UT_BSP_Lock, UT_BSP_Unlock, UtList_GetHead, UtList_GetNext, UtList_GetObject, UtList_Destroy, UtAssert_BeginTest, UtAssert_SetContext, UtAssert_EndTest, UT_BSP_EndTest, UtAssert_GetCounters: these are other functions called by UtTest_Run (shown in the call graph). Their behavior can affect control flow inside UtTest_Run (for example, they might abort the test, longjmp, call exit, or conditionally prevent later code from running). To conclude that the UtList_Merge call site is reachable you must ensure none of these intervening calls cause the call to be skipped at runtime.\n\nIn addition to the above symbols, you should examine build-time configuration (preprocessor macros, conditional compilation units) and the link map to confirm that UtList_Merge (and its callers) are actually included in the build and not removed by configuration \u2014 these are not single function symbols but are necessary artifacts for a complete unreachable-code analysis."
