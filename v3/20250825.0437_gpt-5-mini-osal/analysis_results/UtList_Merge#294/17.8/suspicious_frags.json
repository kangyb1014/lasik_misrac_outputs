    "    Tail1->Next    = TagHead2;",
    "    TagHead2->Prev = Tail1;",
    "    Tail2->Next    = TagHead1;",
    "    TagHead1->Prev = Tail2;"
  ],
  "explanation": "No function parameter pointer (TagHead1 or TagHead2) is reassigned in this function \u2014 only the objects they point to have their members modified. The initial reads (UtListNode_t *Tail1 = TagHead1->Prev; and UtListNode_t *Tail2 = TagHead2->Prev;) do not modify parameters. Tail1 and Tail2 are local variables, so assignments to them are not parameter modifications. Therefore only the four member-assignment statements above need investigation to confirm that modifying the objects pointed to by the pointer parameters is intended and compliant with Rule 17.8."
