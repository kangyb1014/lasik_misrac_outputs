  "explanation": "1) UtListNode_t (struct definition): UtList_Merge manipulates the Prev and Next members of UtListNode_t. To be sure the function does not compare null-terminated strings (directly or indirectly) you must inspect the struct to confirm it does not contain embedded character arrays or string pointers that might be compared here or by inlined/macro code. 2) memcmp (standard library function / any macro alias): The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Confirming compliance requires verifying that UtList_Merge does not call memcmp (directly) and that no identifier used in the function is a macro or alias that expands to memcmp. Provide the memcmp declaration and any local aliases. 3) Translation unit (source file) and its included headers / preprocessor macro definitions: Macros or inline functions in the same translation unit or included headers can hide uses of memcmp (for example a macro that expands to memcmp or an inline wrapper that calls memcmp). To be certain the target function does not violate the rule you need the source file text and its included headers / macro definitions so you can detect such macro/inline substitutions and any indirect calls to memcmp."
