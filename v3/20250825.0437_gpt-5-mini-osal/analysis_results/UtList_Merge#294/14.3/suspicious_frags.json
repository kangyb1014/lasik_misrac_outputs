  "explanation": "No controlling expressions (no if, switch, for, while, or do-while statements) appear in the provided function. Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of selection/iteration statements being invariant; since the code consists only of pointer declarations and unconditional assignments (dereferences and links), there are no controlling expressions to check. The listed exceptions (infinite-loop invariants, do-while constant-false allowances) are not relevant because no loops or conditional controls exist. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
