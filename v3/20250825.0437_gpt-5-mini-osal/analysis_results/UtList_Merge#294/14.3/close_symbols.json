Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) typedef/struct UtListNode_t (full definition): Needed to know the exact types and qualifiers of the Prev/Next members (e.g. pointer type, volatile, _Atomic, const, or function-pointer types). This determines whether the assignments in UtList_Merge are simple pointer stores or potentially have side\u2011effects or involve hidden control flow that could create or depend on an invariant controlling expression.\n\n2) UtListNode_t::Prev member declaration (type and qualifiers): Required to verify whether the Prev access is a plain data member or something that could expand to an expression with control flow (for example, if its type carries qualifiers or custom access semantics). Qualifiers (volatile/_Atomic) or unexpected types could affect whether any controlling expression is invariant or observable.\n\n3) UtListNode_t::Next member declaration (type and qualifiers): Same rationale as for Prev \u2014 the exact type/qualifiers of Next determine whether the Next assignments are side\u2011effect free or mask hidden control behavior.\n\n4) Any preprocessor macros named Prev or Next (or macros that expand UtList_Merge): The source shown uses member names Prev/Next and the function name; if either of those identifiers is actually a macro, the apparent simple assignments might expand into code containing loops or conditional (controlling) expressions. To conclude there is no invariant controlling expression you must rule out macro expansions that introduce control constructs.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows the next reviewer to confirm there are no hidden/expanded controlling expressions in the function and therefore determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
