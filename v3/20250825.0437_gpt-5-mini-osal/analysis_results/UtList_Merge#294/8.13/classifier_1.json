  "scenario": "Not violated. In the fragment TagHead1->Prev = Tail2 the pointer TagHead1 is used to modify the object (assign to its Prev member), so TagHead1 must be a pointer to a non-const UtListNode_t. Rule 8.13 would be violated if the pointer were only used for read-only access \u2014 e.g. if the function only read TagHead1->Prev, then TagHead1 could/should be declared const UtListNode_t *TagHead1."
