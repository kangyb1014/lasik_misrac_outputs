  "explanation": "I found no uses of any of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code fragments. The functions shown (UtList_Merge, UtList_GetHead, UtList_GetNext, UtList_GetObject, UtList_Destroy) perform pointer manipulations and a free(), but do not call or wrap any string handling functions that could cause out-of-bounds accesses as covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. There are also no visible macros or indirect calls to string.h functions in the given snippets. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation specifically for Rule 21.17. (Note: pointer-safety or null-dereference concerns in UtList_Merge or other functions are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and thus were not flagged.)"
