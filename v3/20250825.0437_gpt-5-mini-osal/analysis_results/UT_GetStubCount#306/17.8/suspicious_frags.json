  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter FuncKey passed by value and it is not modified anywhere in the body (only read when passed to UT_GetStubEntry). There are no pointer parameters in this function, so the rule\u2019s prohibition on modifying pointer parameters or the pointer itself does not apply. Local variables (StubPtr, Count) are assigned locally and are not function parameters. Therefore no fragments in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
