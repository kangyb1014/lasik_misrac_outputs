  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are manifestly invariant. The only conditional is\n    if (StubPtr != NULL)\nand StubPtr is assigned from the call UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_COUNTER), so the condition depends on that function's return value and is not an invariant constant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or other controlling constructs with constant/compile-time expressions (e.g. no for(;;), while(1), or do { } while(0/false) patterns) that would fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 or its exceptions. Passing the constant UT_ENTRYTYPE_COUNTER as an argument does not make any controlling expression invariant. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require further investigation for Rule 14.3."
