  "explanation": "For determining whether this function can violate the string.h bounds rule you must confirm there are no hidden uses of string functions and that all array/index operations are in-bounds. Each requested symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- OS_FdSet (type/struct): needed to see the actual declaration/definition of the OSAL set object so you can tell whether object_ids is an array or a pointer and its declared size.\n\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids (member): the code indexes and takes sizeof(object_ids). Knowing its element type and array length is required to decide whether the loop bounds (offset < sizeof(...)) and subsequent object_ids[offset] accesses are safe (or if sizeof yields pointer size and thus is incorrect).\n\n- uint8 (typedef): to confirm the width and signedness of the elements used for bit operations; the code assumes 8 bits (shifts and (1 << bit)). If uint8 is not 8 bits, the bit math and mask may produce out-of-range shifts or mask values.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef): used to compute id = OSAL_INDEX_C((offset * 8) + bit); you must know its range/width to determine whether the computed id can overflow or compare correctly against OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro or inline function): this macro/function transforms the computed bit index into an osal_index_t. It could perform bounds checks, casts, or other transformations (or even call library functions). You must inspect it to ensure it does not invoke string.h functions and that it does not produce out-of-bounds ids.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): used to guard access to OS_impl_filehandle_table; you must know its value to reason whether id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES prevents out-of-bounds access of the filehandle table.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (array): the code indexes this table with id to fetch .fd. You must know the array length, type, and linkage to confirm id indexing cannot go out-of-bounds and that reading the fd field is safe.\n\n- type of OS_impl_filehandle_table elements (structure with member 'fd'): to verify the 'fd' member exists, its type (signedness/size), and whether any accessor macro might hide calls to string functions or other side effects.\n\n- fd_set (system type): FD_ISSET operates on fd_set; you need the fd_set definition (or at least its semantics) to ensure FD_ISSET() is just a bit-test macro and not a wrapper that could call string functions or perform out-of-bounds memory accesses.\n\n- FD_ISSET (macro): inspect its definition to ensure it is a simple bit-test (no hidden calls to string.h functions) and that passing osfd (which may be negative or large) into FD_ISSET does not cause undefined behavior or out-of-bounds access into the fd_set storage.\n\nTogether these symbols let you determine (a) whether any string.h functions are invoked directly or indirectly (e.g. via macros), and (b) whether any memory accesses (object_ids[offset], shifts/masks, OS_impl_filehandle_table[id], FD_ISSET(osfd,...)) can access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects."
