  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule on language extensions you must inspect the definitions of all non\u2011standard types/macros/objects used by the function to see whether those definitions employ compiler extensions. Each listed symbol is needed for that reason:\n\n- OS_FdSet\n  - Needed to inspect the structure definition (particularly object_ids) to see if it uses nonstandard constructs (anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields with implementation\u2011defined widths, GCC/Clang attributes, or other extensions).\n\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids\n  - The code indexes and applies sizeof() to this member; its element type and size (e.g. flexible array, VLA, or compiler extension types) must be checked for extensions.\n\n- fd_set\n  - A system type often provided by headers; its definition (or macro) could be implemented using compiler extensions on some platforms and must be checked.\n\n- FD_ISSET\n  - A macro (or function) used in the conditional. Macros can hide compiler extensions (statement expressions, builtin intrinsics, inline assembly, GCC extensions). You must see its definition.\n\n- osal_index_t\n  - Typedef for id variables; may itself be defined using implementation extensions (e.g. as a typedef to a GCC extension type, or using attributes). Inspecting it rules out extensions.\n\n- uint8\n  - Not the standard uint8_t; could be a project typedef or macro that uses extensions. Confirm its definition to ensure no extension usage.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C\n  - Macro used to convert/construct an index value; macros are a common place for compiler extensions (casting tricks, suffixes, GCC statement expressions). Its expansion must be inspected.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES\n  - Compile\u2011time constant that might be defined using nonstandard constructs (e.g. complex macro, __extension__, or computed with compiler builtins). Its definition should be checked.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table\n  - The table object and the type of its elements must be inspected (its declaration could use attributes, packed structs, or other extensions).\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd\n  - The fd field type and any attributes on it need inspection to ensure no language extensions are used (bit\u2011fields with nonstandard widths, attributes, etc.).\n\nYou do not need standard types like size_t or language keywords. The items above are the nonstandard/project symbols/macros which, if defined using compiler extensions, would cause a MISRA Language\u2011extension violation; therefore their definitions are required for analysis."
