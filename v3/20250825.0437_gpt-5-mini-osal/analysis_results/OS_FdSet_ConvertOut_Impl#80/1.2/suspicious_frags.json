  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function and related symbols only use standard C constructs and user-defined macros/typedefs: local variables declared at function start, standard types (size_t, typedefs for integer types), ordinary casts via the OSAL_INDEX_C macro, array indexing, bitwise operations, and use of the POSIX fd_set/FD_ISSET macro (a standard API macro, not a compiler extension). There are no occurrences of known compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC), statement-expressions ({ ... }) GCC extension, inline assembly, pragmas specific to compilers, or other documented compiler-specific extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
