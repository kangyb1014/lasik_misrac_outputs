Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remainder of the function implements the loop control and bit-scanning mechanics and should not be considered dead without further context: the outer for loop bound (for (offset = 0; offset < sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids); ++offset)) is required to visit every byte of the object_ids array; the local snapshot assignment (objids = OSAL_set->object_ids[offset];), the while condition (while (objids != 0)), the bit index initialization (bit = 0), the loop progression operations (++bit; objids >>= 1;) and the test of the current bit ((objids & 0x01) != 0) are all necessary to iterate the bits correctly. The FD_ISSET check is a functional decision point (it affects whether a bit is cleared) and the sizeof-based iteration prevents out-of-bounds accesses \u2014 these operations have observable effects on program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2. No other statements in the function are obviously inert without additional build-time/run-time information."
