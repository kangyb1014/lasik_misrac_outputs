  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters should be const-qualified you must know whether they are actually mutated or passed to callees that require non-const. The required symbols and why:\n\n- OS_FdSet (definition): shows the layout and which members exist. Required to determine whether OSAL_set is written to (so it cannot be made const) and which members are touched.\n\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids (type and size): the function writes to OSAL_set->object_ids[...] &= ~(...). The exact member type (e.g. uint8[]) and mutability confirm that OSAL_set must be non-const.\n\n- fd_set (definition): needed to reason about whether OS_set could be declared const. Knowing the fd_set layout helps judge whether operations on it are read-only.\n\n- FD_ISSET (macro or function): the only usage of OS_set in this function is via FD_ISSET. You must know whether FD_ISSET is implemented as a macro (purely read-only access, so a const fd_set * parameter would be acceptable) or as a function taking a non-const fd_set * (which would prevent changing the parameter type to const).\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table and its element type (with 'fd'): the code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd to obtain an integer passed to FD_ISSET. Include this to ensure there are no side-effects or aliasing that would require OS_set to be non-const and to verify that accesses do not write into OS_set.\n\n- osal_index_t and OSAL_INDEX_C: used to produce the id value. Include to confirm they do not perform hidden writes/pointer casts that would affect const-qualification decisions.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): object_ids elements are of this type; confirm its signedness/width and that modifications are legitimate (and therefore OSAL_set cannot be const).\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (constant): used in the id bounds check; included to fully understand control-flow that may affect whether OS_set is accessed/modified.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine (1) whether OSAL_set is modified (so must be non-const), and (2) whether OS_set is only read and whether any called macro/function requires a non-const fd_set pointer (thus whether OS_set's parameter could be declared const)."
