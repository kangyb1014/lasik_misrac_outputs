  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers could/should be to const-qualified types. The only code locations that require investigation are those that involve pointer parameters or dereferences of external arrays/objects via pointers. Other fragments in the function are simple local scalar declarations and manipulations (loop indices, bit shifts, temporary copies), reads of a local copy of the byte mask, bitwise tests, loop control, and use of sizeof \u2014 none of which introduce additional pointer targets that could be const-qualified or are purely internal operations. The selected fragments show (a) the function-level pointer parameters, (b) an access through an external table/object, (c) a use of the fd_set pointer in a membership test, and (d) an explicit write through the OSAL set; these are the sites that need checking for correct const qualification. Other lines do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
