  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any symbols that could: (a) be or contain null-terminated strings, (b) expand to or call memcmp, or (c) change the interpretation of the data being compared. Specifically:\n\n- OS_FdSet (struct/type): gives the full definition of the OSAL_set parameter type. You must see whether OSAL_set is a string container or merely a bitmap container.\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids (member): the function indexes and bit-tests this member; its element type (e.g. char vs uint8_t) and intended semantics (bitmap vs C-string) are crucial to determine if any byte-wise operations could be misinterpreted as string comparisons.\n- uint8 (typedef): establishes the exact width/signedness of object_ids elements; if it aliases char this affects whether they could be treated as characters/strings.\n- osal_index_t (typedef): needed to understand the index arithmetic and whether conversions/macros could coerce string pointers or trigger other library usage.\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro/function-like macro): it computes id from numeric expression; the macro expansion might hide other operations (casts, function calls) that could use memcmp or string handling\u2014so its definition must be inspected.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): used in the id bounds check; knowing its value/definition helps verify whether object_ids indexing could overflow or be used elsewhere as string limits.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table and its element type (struct with 'fd' member): the code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd. You must inspect the table definition to ensure no hidden members/functions or accessors use memcmp on string members, and to confirm 'fd' is an int (not a pointer to char or string). \n- fd_set (type): FD_ISSET is applied to elements of this type; inspect fd_set layout to ensure no macros replace FD_ISSET with a helper that might call memcmp.\n- FD_ISSET (macro): this macro's expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not expand to code that calls memcmp (or otherwise compares null-terminated strings).\n- memcmp (standard library function): include the symbol so the analyzer can check all available expansions/definitions to ensure no indirect use of memcmp occurs via macros/functions referenced above. If memcmp appears nowhere in the inspected expansions, the rule is not violated by this function.\n\nIn short: the analysis must verify whether any of the used types/macros/globals are actually strings or expand/call into memcmp/string-comparison code. The listed symbols are the minimal set required to perform that check."
