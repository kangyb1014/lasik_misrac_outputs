  "explanation": "No pointer-to-object occurrences in the function are suitable for const-qualification. The function returns a UT_StubTableEntry_t * and the local variable StubEntryPtr is assigned from UT_GetStubEntry and then used to modify the pointed-to object (decrementing and incrementing StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter). Because the code intentionally mutates the referred structure fields, qualifying the pointed-to type as const would prevent required modifications. The two calls to UT_GetStubEntry likewise return pointers that this function uses to change the entries; without the implementation of UT_GetStubEntry there is no indication the pointers should be to const. Therefore there are no fragments here that should be investigated for Rule 8.13 (pointer-to-const where possible)."
