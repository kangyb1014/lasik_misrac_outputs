Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig:\n```c\nUT_StubTableEntry_t *UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubEntryPtr;\n\n    StubEntryPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED);\n    if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        /*\n         * The counter on a deferred retval config indicates the number of times it should\n         * be skipped/not used.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown context: the ++StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter modifies observable program state (the usage counter for constant retval configs) and thus removing it would change program behaviour (how many times the value is considered used). However, a violation would occur if the Counter field is never read/used by the program (e.g. only present for unused diagnostics) \u2014 in that case incrementing it would be executed but its removal would not affect behaviour, and would therefore be dead code."
