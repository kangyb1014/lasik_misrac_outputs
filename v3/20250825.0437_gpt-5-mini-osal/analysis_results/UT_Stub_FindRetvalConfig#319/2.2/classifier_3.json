Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig:\n```c\nUT_StubTableEntry_t *UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubEntryPtr;\n\n    StubEntryPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED);\n    if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        /*\n         * The counter on a deferred retval config indicates the number of times it should\n         * be skipped/not used.

  "scenario": "The assignment StubEntryPtr = NULL is used to select a fallback retval when the deferred counter has not yet expired. After --StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter the check if (Counter > 0) sets StubEntryPtr to NULL so that the later if (StubEntryPtr == NULL) path will fetch a constant retval (or use the default). Removing this assignment would change control flow and the returned StubEntryPtr, so the operation is not dead code."
