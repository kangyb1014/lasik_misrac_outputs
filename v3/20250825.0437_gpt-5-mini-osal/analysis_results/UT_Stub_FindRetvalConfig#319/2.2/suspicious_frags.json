Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments in the function are basic control structure, declarations, NULL checks and the return statement which implement the intended selection/fallback logic and cannot be classified as dead without broader program context (they affect control flow and the returned pointer). Comments and the function signature are not executable code. The outer NULL checks (if (StubEntryPtr != NULL)) and the final return are necessary for correct behavior and therefore do not need investigation for dead-code under Rule 2.2 absent additional evidence."
