  "explanation": "For checking MISRA's for-loop well-formedness in the context of OS_Lock_Global, the analyzer must know any symbols that affect control flow, loop counters, or possible side effects inside loop bodies (including side effects of functions called from a loop). Although OS_Lock_Global itself contains no for loop, the rule's scope includes the behavior of functions called from a for loop body and any objects those functions modify. The listed symbols are required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_objtype_state, OS_objtype_state_t: The function reads and writes fields in this global array (transaction_count, owner_key). To determine whether those fields are modified by called functions or could be used as loop counters elsewhere, the concrete type and definition are required.\n- OS_object_token_t: The token parameter's layout (obj_type, lock_mode, lock_key) is needed to see which objects are read/written and whether those objects could serve as loop counters or be modified by the function.\n- OS_lock_key_t (type of token->lock_key / objtype->owner_key): The lock key structure and its key_value member are written here; need its definition to confirm exactly which objects are modified.\n- osal_id_t: The task id type is used and converted; its definition may affect whether conversions/operations have side effects or wider effects relevant to loop analysis.\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED, OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE: These macros/constants determine which control-flow branch is taken and produce writes to globals \u2014 knowing their values and possible expansions is necessary to determine whether any loop counters or control flags are read/modified.\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl (decl + def): Called and its behavior (pure/read-only vs. side effects vs. modifying global state) must be known because MISRA forbids loop conditions/clauses to rely on objects modified in the loop body \u2014 if this function is called from a for clause/loop body elsewhere, its side effects matter.\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl (decl + def): Called to acquire lock; its implementation may modify globals (including ones that could be used as loop counters elsewhere) or contain for loops itself. Need to inspect for compliance and side effects.\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (decl + def): Its semantics and side effects must be known (does it modify global state?) because it is used in conditional logic here and could be invoked in loop contexts elsewhere.\n- OS_ObjectIdToInteger (decl + def): Called to compute integer id; must confirm it has no hidden side effects that would violate the MISRA rules for for-loop clauses if used in loop headers or bodies.\n- OS_DEBUG (macro/function): Logging macros sometimes expand to code with side effects (e.g., function calls, loops). Need its definition to ensure it doesn't introduce for-loops or modify loop counters if used within a for statement.\n\nIn short, to determine whether any for loop involving OS_Lock_Global (directly or indirectly) is well-formed per MISRA, the analyzer must know the exact definitions and side effects of the functions called here, the global objects read/written by the function, and any macros/constants that affect control flow or may expand to code with side effects."
