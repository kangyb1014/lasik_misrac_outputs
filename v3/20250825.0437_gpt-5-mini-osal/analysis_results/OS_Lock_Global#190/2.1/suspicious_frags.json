  "explanation": "The fragments above represent the conditional branches and error-handling paths that determine reachability for the function's behaviour and therefore warrant inspection for possible unreachable code. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 because they are simple, directly reachable statements within those conditional paths: the local variable declarations, the call to OS_Lock_Global_Impl(token->obj_type) (which is invoked when the top-level condition is true), the computation and assignment to token->lock_key.key_value, and the increment ++objtype->transaction_count are normal, obviously reachable operations in the true branch. There are no immediate syntactic dead-code constructs (e.g. code after a return, unconditional goto bypassing code, or mutually exclusive constant conditions) elsewhere in the function that would make those other lines unreachable; thus only the control-flow branches and their associated error-handling/debug messages were marked for investigation."
