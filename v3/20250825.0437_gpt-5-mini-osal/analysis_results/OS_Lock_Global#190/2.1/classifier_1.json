  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The branch handles the case where OS_TaskGetId_Impl() returns an invalid task id (e.g., non-OSAL-created or root/initial context), so the assignment to self_task_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED is reachable in that case. This would only be a Rule 2.1 violation if it can be proven (by code inspection or static analysis of OS_TaskGetId_Impl and OS_ObjectIdIsValid) that OS_ObjectIdIsValid(self_task_id) is always true for all callers; in that provable case the block would be unreachable and should be removed or the logic adjusted."
