  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The single function parameter is a pointer (OS_object_token_t *token). The code only modifies the object pointed to (e.g. token->lock_key.key_value = ..., reads token->obj_type, token->lock_mode, and uses token->lock_key), which is permitted by the rule. There is no assignment to the parameter variable itself (no statements like token = ..., token++, or similar), so the pointer parameter is not modified. Assignments to objtype or objtype->owner_key modify other objects, not the parameter variable, and local variable self_task_id is freely modified. Therefore no fragments violate Rule 17.8."
