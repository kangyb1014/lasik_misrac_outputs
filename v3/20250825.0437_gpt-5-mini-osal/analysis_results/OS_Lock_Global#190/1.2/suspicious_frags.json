  "explanation": "I did not find any constructs in the provided code that are clearly compiler-specific language extensions (for example: GNU statement-expressions, typeof, nested functions, __attribute__, __asm__, label-as-values, or other vendor-specific keywords). The potentially noteworthy constructs are standard C99/C11 features or POSIX APIs, not compiler extensions:\n\n- The compound literal in the macro #define OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED ((osal_id_t){0xFFFFFFFF}) is a standard C99 compound literal, not a compiler extension.\n- The use of static inline and the bool type are standard since C99/C11 (inline and stdbool.h), not extensions.\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature.\n- Use of pthread_* and strerror are POSIX library/API calls, not language extensions.\n- Union usage and the comment suppressing cppcheck are not language extensions.\n\nIf you are targeting a compiler that explicitly documents any of these specific features (compound literals, inline, variadic macros, stdbool, etc.) as nonstandard extensions for that compiler, then those exact lines should be re-examined. With no compiler-specific documentation provided, there are no fragments that must be reported as MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 violations based on language extensions."
