  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of selection/iteration statements. In the provided function there are no other controlling expressions (no for/while/do-while loops and no other if/switch statements) beyond the two listed items. The remaining lines are function calls, assignments, a memset, comments and the final return \u2014 none of which are controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. Investigate the listed fragments because macros can expand to control constructs or the called routine might return a constant, which could make a controlling expression invariant."
