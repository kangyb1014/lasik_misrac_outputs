  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer parameters appear in OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (which requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible) is not applicable to the shown code. The function only: (1) indexes an array OS_impl_filehandle_table and assigns to its fd member (an integral type), (2) assigns return values of geteuid() and getegid() to scalar globals OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID, and (3) returns an integer constant. There are no pointer variables, pointer parameters, pointer returns, pointer casts, or uses of pointer-to-non-const where a pointer-to-const would be obviously appropriate in the provided snippet. Note: if the definition of OS_impl_file_internal_record_t (or other related types) contains pointer members, those pointer declarations are outside the presented function and must be reviewed separately; they are not present in the shown code and thus are not flagged here."
