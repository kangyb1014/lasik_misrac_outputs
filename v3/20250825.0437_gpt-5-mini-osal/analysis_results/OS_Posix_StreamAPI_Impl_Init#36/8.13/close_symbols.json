  "explanation": "For the MISRA rule about qualifying pointers as const where possible we must confirm whether any identifiers in the function are pointer types (and therefore candidates for const qualification) or are non\u2011pointer scalar/array types. Explaination for each symbol: \n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: determine whether this is an array of structs, a pointer to structs, or a pointer to pointer; if it is a pointer type it might need const qualification. \n- <element type of OS_impl_filehandle_table> (struct definition that contains member 'fd'): the element type reveals whether indexing yields a struct value or a pointer; necessary to see if any pointer members exist inside the element that should be const.\n- type of the 'fd' member: verify that fd is an integer (scalar) and not a pointer; if fd is a pointer it would be relevant to the const qualification rule.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: confirm this is an integer constant (loop bound) and not some pointer/complex type.\n- osal_index_t: confirm the loop index type is an integer typedef and not a pointer type.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: confirm these symbols' declarations/types to ensure they are scalar (uid_t or similar) and not pointer objects that would require const qualification.\n- geteuid (prototype) and getegid (prototype): confirm return types are scalar (uid_t) and that the functions do not return pointers that are assigned to non\u2011const objects.\n- uid_t (or actual return type of geteuid/getegid): needed to verify the type assigned to OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID/EGID is not a pointer type.\n- OS_SUCCESS: confirm return constant type (integer) to ensure no pointer is being returned.\n\nWith these symbols and their types/definitions known, an analyst can determine whether any pointer appears in the function that could or should be const\u2011qualified per MISRA C."
