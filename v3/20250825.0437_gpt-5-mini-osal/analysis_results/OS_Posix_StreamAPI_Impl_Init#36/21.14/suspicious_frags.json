  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related symbol definitions. There are no calls to the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any string comparisons of null-terminated strings in the shown code. The function only assigns an integer field (fd) in a table, and reads the process euid/egid via geteuid/getegid (no string handling). The provided macros/typedefs are integer types or constants and contain no memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other source files or implementations (e.g. elsewhere in OS_impl_file_internal_record_t or other modules) that were not provided, those would need to be checked, but based on the given code nothing violates or even uses memcmp."
