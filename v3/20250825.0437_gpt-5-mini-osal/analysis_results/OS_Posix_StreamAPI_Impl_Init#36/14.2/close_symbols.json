The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef): To confirm the loop counter is an ordinary integer type (not volatile, not an aggregate or weird type that carries side-effects when incremented). MISRA requires the loop counter to be a single identifier of an integral type that is manipulated only by the loop clauses.\n\n- local_id (local loop variable declaration): Although declared in the function, its exact declaration (storage class, qualifiers) must be checked to ensure it is the sole loop counter, not volatile, and not otherwise modified by aliasing or through side-effects external to the for-clause. This verifies clause (1) and (4).\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): The second clause uses this symbol. To satisfy MISRA the second clause must not use objects that are modified in the loop body and must have no persistent side-effects. The definition/identity of OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES is required to verify it is a compile-time constant / not modified by the loop body or via aliasing.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (array/object): The loop body writes to OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd. To verify MISRA clause (2)/(3)/(4) we must confirm that modifying this object does not affect the loop counter or any other object used in the loop clauses, and that no aliasing or side-effects could cause the second or third clause to depend on an object modified in the body.\n\n- type/definition of OS_impl_filehandle_table element (struct) and its member 'fd': The exact element type and the type of 'fd' are needed to ensure the assignment in the loop body modifies only that element and does not have hidden side-effects (e.g. via an overloaded operator is not a concern in C, but need to check for volatile members, bitfields with side-effects, or macros). This confirms the only object modified in the body is a table element, distinct from the loop counter and not used in the loop clauses.\n\n(Notes: There are no function calls inside the for statement; geteuid/getegid are called after the loop and therefore not relevant to the for-statement well-formedness. OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID/EGID and OS_SUCCESS are outside the loop and not needed to judge MISRA rule compliance for the for-loop.)"
