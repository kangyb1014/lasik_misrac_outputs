  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\n```c\nint32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)\n{\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /*\n     * init all filehandles to -1, which is always invalid.\n     * this isn't strictly necessary but helps when debugging.\n     */\n    for (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n    {\n        OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n    }\n\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n{\n    OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The for loop uses a single loop counter (local_id). First clause initializes the loop counter (local_id = 0). Second clause (local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) is a pure test using only the loop counter and a constant (no persistent side effects and it does not reference any object modified in the loop body). Third clause (++local_id) modifies only the loop counter. The loop body does not modify the loop counter. Therefore the loop is well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
