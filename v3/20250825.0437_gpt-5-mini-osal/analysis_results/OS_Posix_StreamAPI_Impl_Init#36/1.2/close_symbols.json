  "explanation": "For determining whether OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init uses any compiler/language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions/macros/types that the function references so you can detect any non\u2011standard/implementation\u2011specific constructs (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, inline asm, compiler builtins, packed/aligned attributes, nonstandard typedefs). Reason for each symbol:\n- osal_index_t: need the typedef to ensure it is a plain standard C type and not defined via a compiler extension or unusual built\u2011in type.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: need the macro/constant expansion to check it is a standard integer constant and not produced by an extension or computed by a compiler builtin.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: need the declaration/definition to see how the table is declared (array, pointer, location, storage class) and whether its definition uses extensions.\n- type/definition of elements of OS_impl_filehandle_table (struct/union) including member `fd`: need the element type and the `fd` member declaration to verify the member type is standard C and that the struct does not use attributes/extensions (packed, aligned, bitfields with implementation specific width, attribute((...)), etc.).\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: need their definitions (macros or variables) to detect if they expand to or are implemented with compiler extensions (e.g. hidden attributes, asm, or compiler builtins) rather than plain identifiers.\n- geteuid and getegid (declarations/prototypes or macro definitions): need to confirm these identifiers are standard POSIX functions (normal prototypes) and not replaced by macros or inline compiler extensions in this codebase.\n- OS_SUCCESS: need the macro/enum value definition to ensure it is a standard integer constant and not an extension.\n\nInspecting these symbols will allow the next analyzer to determine whether any referenced symbol or its expansion uses language/compiler extensions; the function body itself uses only standard C constructs (for loop, assignment, array indexing, function calls), so the question hinges on the definitions/expansions of the listed symbols."
