  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not provably correct from the snippet alone. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The assignment OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid() is dead only if the write has no observable effect anywhere in the program. To establish a violation you must show that (a) OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID is never read/used after this assignment and (b) calling getegid() has no observable side effects (including timing or interactions visible to the system). Neither of these facts is shown. Conversely, if the variable is read later (or some diagnostic or timing behaviour depends on the call), the assignment is required and not dead. Therefore the report is not conclusively correct; it would be correct only if a whole-project analysis proves the global is never read and the call has no required side effects. Recommended actions: search the codebase for reads of OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID and consider whether removing the getegid() call would change timing or behaviour; if it is unused, remove the assignment/global or document/suppress with appropriate justification."
