Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\n```c\nint32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)\n{\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /*\n     * init all filehandles to -1, which is always invalid.\n     * this isn't strictly necessary but helps when debugging.\n     */\n    for (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n    {\n        OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n    }\n\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment 'gid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0' is a global object definition with static initialization. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 excludes initialization from being considered dead code (see note 3). Although OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init overwrites OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID with getegid(), the file-scope initializer is not an executed assignment that can be treated as dead code \u2014 removing it could change program behaviour if the variable is ever read before the init routine runs or rely on a defined startup value. Therefore this does not violate Rule 2.2."
