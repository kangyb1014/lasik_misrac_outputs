Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\n```c\nint32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)\n{\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /*\n     * init all filehandles to -1, which is always invalid.\n     * this isn't strictly necessary but helps when debugging.\n     */\n    for (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n    {\n        OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n    }\n\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n{\n    OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown context: the loop assigns OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1 at runtime to ensure filehandles are invalid. Removing these assignments could change program behaviour (e.g. code that tests for fd == -1 would behave differently), so they are not dead code. (A concrete violation scenario would be if the table were already guaranteed to be initialized to -1 by a static initializer or prior code and no code ever observed the preexisting values before they were overwritten \u2014 in that specific case the assignments would be redundant and thus constitute dead code.)"
