In that case the executed call to geteuid() and the store have no effect on program observable behaviour, so removing them would not change program behaviour (except for minor timing differences noted by MISRA). If, however, OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID is read later (e.g. used in permission checks, logging, diagnostics), then the assignment is required and not dead code.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is speculative and cannot be shown correct from the supplied snippets alone. MISRA 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect observable program behaviour. The assignment OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid(); would only be dead code if (a) the global OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID is never subsequently read anywhere in the program and (b) the call to geteuid() has no observable side effects that the rest of the program relies on. Neither of these facts is established by the provided code. \n\nTo prove a Rule 2.2 violation you must perform whole-program analysis (or provide the full translation unit/project evidence) showing that OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID is never used and that calling geteuid() has no relevant side effects. Absent that evidence, one cannot conclude the assignment is dead code. Therefore the report as stated is not correct."
