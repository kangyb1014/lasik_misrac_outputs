Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The for-loop condition is `local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES`. To decide if that controlling expression is invariant (e.g. always false because the bound is 0, or otherwise constant across iterations) you must know whether this symbol is a compile-time constant, its value, or a modifiable object that could change during the loop.\n\nosal_index_t: local_id is declared with this typedef. Its signedness, width, and overflow/wrap behavior determine whether ++local_id actually changes the value used in the controlling expression each iteration (and whether the comparison can become invariant due to wrap/UB). MISRA analysis needs the exact integer type semantics.\n\nOS_impl_filehandle_table: The loop body writes into this symbol indexed by local_id. The symbol's declaration is needed to ensure the indexing/assignment cannot have side effects that affect local_id or OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (for example if OS_impl_filehandle_table is a macro or accessor function with hidden side effects). If the write can indirectly alter the controlling expression, that affects the MISRA analysis.\n\nOS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd: The specific field being assigned \u2014 its type and any overloaded/side-effecting behavior \u2014 is required to rule out side effects in the assignment expression that might modify local_id or the loop bound. If the field access is implemented via a macro or function-like mechanism, it could affect the controlling expression."
