  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions or other standard string/memory functions are present in the provided code fragment. The function only: (1) iterates an index and assigns an integer constant to a filehandle field, and (2) calls geteuid() and getegid(). There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string handling functions, nor any char-buffer copies or pointer arithmetic that would imply potential out-of-bounds accesses related to Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 compliance."
