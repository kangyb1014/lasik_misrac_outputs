  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA for-loop analysis:\n\n- UT_GENRE_SIZE\n  - This is a macro (or function-like macro) invoked in the switch selector. Macros can expand into arbitrary code (including for statements). To be sure UT_StoreRetval does not implicitly contain or invoke a for loop or side effects that affect loop analysis, the expansion/definition of UT_GENRE_SIZE must be inspected.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER, UT_ValueGenre_FLOAT, UT_ValueGenre_POINTER (and UT_ValueGenre_t)\n  - These enum/constant symbols are passed to UT_GENRE_SIZE. Their definitions could be macros or computed values that are implemented via macros or inline functions; inspect them to ensure no hidden control flow/loops are introduced. Also include UT_ValueGenre_t (the type) to see if any operators or conversions invoke macros.\n\n- UT_RetvalBuf_t and its fields (UT_RetvalBuf_t::Integer, UT_RetvalBuf_t::FloatingPt, UT_RetvalBuf_t::Ptr)\n  - The code writes to Buf->Integer / FloatingPt / Ptr. Confirm the definition: ensure those are ordinary struct members (no accessor macros, no inline functions, no assignment operator overloads via macros) so the writes do not expand to function calls or loops. If accessors are macros, they might contain loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop rule.\n\n- int8, int16, int32, int64 (typedefs)\n  - The code casts ValuePtr to these types. Verify these typedefs are plain integral types (or fixed-width typedefs) and are not macros or aliases to types whose conversion has side effects. A typedef or macro that hides complex code could include loops or change semantic of casts.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed\n  - Called in the default branch. UtAssert_Failed is frequently a macro that expands to assert infrastructure (might call other functions, e.g., to log, halt or iterate). The MISRA for-loop rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside a for loop as part of the loop body; while there is no for in UT_StoreRetval itself, a macro expansion here could nonetheless introduce control structures. Inspect this symbol to ensure it does not introduce for loops or side-effects that would interact with any loop inlined/expanded into UT_StoreRetval.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext\n  - The static call graph shows this as a callee (likely via UtAssert_Failed). If UtAssert_Failed expands to a call sequence including UtAssert_GetContext, that function's body must be verified for loops or for-loop interactions (side effects on objects that could be used as loop counters elsewhere).\n\nNotes on scope: UT_StoreRetval itself (as provided) contains no for statements. The symbols above are included because macros, accessors, typedefs, or assertion infrastructure that are referenced by UT_StoreRetval could expand to or call code containing for statements or produce side effects that would affect a for-statement analysis. To conclude MISRA conformance for the for-loop rule you must inspect these definitions/expansions to ensure no hidden or inlined for loops or loop-affecting side effects exist."
