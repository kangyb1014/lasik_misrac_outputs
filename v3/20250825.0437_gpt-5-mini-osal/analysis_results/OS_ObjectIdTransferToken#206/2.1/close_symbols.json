  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_ObjectIdTransferToken contains unreachable code you need symbols that describe both the function's internal data layout/semantics and the call\u2011graph reachability from program entry points.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The full typedef/struct definition is required to verify that the fields used in the function actually exist (particularly lock_mode), to see whether lock_mode is a real field, its type/bitfield width, and whether struct assignment (*token_to = *token_from) is well\u2011formed and could optimize away or change behavior. Knowledge of nested/volatile/const qualifiers or bitfields may affect whether the second statement is reachable or meaningful.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: The macro/enum value assigned to token_from->lock_mode is needed to understand semantics of the assignment (e.g. whether this value is the same as an existing value, has side effects via macros, or is conditionally defined away). Also needed to confirm this is a compile\u2011time constant and not something that could render the write unreachable under certain preprocessor configurations.\n\n- OS_DoTimerAdd and OS_TimerDelete: These are the immediate callers shown in the static call graph. To decide if the function body is unreachable at the project level you must know whether these callers are themselves reachable; thus their definitions and usage contexts are required.\n\n- OS_TimerAdd and OS_TimerCreate: These are callers of OS_DoTimerAdd (from the provided graph). Including them helps trace upward in the call graph to determine if there exists any path from program entry to OS_ObjectIdTransferToken.\n\n- OS_CleanUpObject: This is a caller of OS_TimerDelete (from the provided graph). It is needed for the same reachability chain analysis.\n\n- program entry points / startup functions (e.g. main or OS initialization routines): To conclude that a function is unreachable within the whole project you must confirm there is no path from any program entry or initialization routine to the function. The set of true roots (main, OS init hooks, static constructors, interrupt/vector table entries, or other known bootstrap routines) must be known so you can traverse callers from those roots and determine whether OS_ObjectIdTransferToken is reachable.\n\nCollecting the above symbols lets an analyst (or tool) determine both: (a) whether any statement in the function can be executed given the type/layout/definitions (internal reachability/meaning), and (b) whether the function itself is reachable from program entry points (global unreachable\u2011code detection)."
