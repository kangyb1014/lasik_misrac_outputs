  "explanation": "No control statements are present in the provided function: there are no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) expressions whose controlling expression could be invariant. The function only performs a struct assignment (*token_to = *token_from) and a simple assignment to a struct member (token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE). These are not \"controlling expressions\" under MISRA Rule 14.3, and neither of the rule's exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the permitted do-while constant-false case) apply. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance."
