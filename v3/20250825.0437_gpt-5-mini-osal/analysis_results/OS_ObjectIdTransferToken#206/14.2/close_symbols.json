The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t: The target function copies the entire struct (*token_to = *token_from). To be sure that this assignment does not expand to or invoke any hidden code that contains a for loop (for example via an unusual definition, macro, inline helper, or non\u2011trivial member semantics), the concrete struct definition is required. Inspecting the fields will show whether any member access or copy could call functions or macros containing for loops.\n\nOS_lock_mode_t (type of token.lock_mode): The function assigns token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE. If lock_mode is actually a macro, inline accessor, or a type with non-trivial assignment semantics, that could introduce code (and therefore loops) in the assignment. Knowing the exact type and its semantics rules out hidden loop behavior and allows checking whether the write modifies objects that could affect loop well-formedness elsewhere.\n\nOS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: This macro/constant must be inspected to ensure it is a simple constant and not defined in terms of an expression, function call, or macro that expands to code containing a for loop or other side effects. If it were a complex macro it could violate the MISRA for\u2011loop rule indirectly when used in assignments or expressions.\n\nNote: The target function has no callees; therefore no other functions from the static call graph need to be inspected for for\u2011loop compliance when analyzing this function. The three symbols above are sufficient to determine whether the function itself (or any hidden expansion in its assignments) contains or invokes for loops that could violate the MISRA requirement."
