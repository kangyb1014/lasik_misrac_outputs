  "explanation": "The remainder of the function contains no other statements that modify the pointer parameters themselves (there are no assignments to token_from or token_to, no increments/decrements, and no reassignments). The function signature only declares pointer parameters \u2014 which by itself does not violate Rule 17.8. All other code is either comments or operations that modify the objects pointed to (dereferenced targets), which is permitted by the rule. Therefore no additional fragments need investigation."
