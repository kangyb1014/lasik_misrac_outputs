  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer-related occurrences are the address-of usages (&ObjectCount) passed as the context/argument to the OS_ForEachObjectOfType/OS_ForEachObject calls and the declaration of ObjectCount itself. There are no other pointer variables, pointer parameters, casts, or pointer arithmetic in the function body that could be candidates for const-qualification. Other fragments (TryCount, the loop, incrementing TryCount, the break/while logic, and the OS_TaskDelay(5) call) do not involve pointer targets and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
