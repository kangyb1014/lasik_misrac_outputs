  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment as written: ObjectCount is intended to be modified by the callback (OS_CleanUpObject) so passing &ObjectCount as a non-const pointer is appropriate. A violation would occur if the API and callback do not modify the pointed-to data but nonetheless accept a non-const pointer (for example if OS_ForEachObject/OS_CleanUpObject take a void * and only read the data) \u2014 in that case the parameter should be const-qualified (const void *) and the code should pass a pointer-to-const or otherwise use const-correct signatures."
