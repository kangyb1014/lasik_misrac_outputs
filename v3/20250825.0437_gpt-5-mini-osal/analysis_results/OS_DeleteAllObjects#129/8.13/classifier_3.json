  "scenario": "The &ObjectCount argument is intended to be an output/accumulator that OS_ForEachObjectOfType updates (it increments/decrements the object count). In that case the function parameter must be a pointer to a non-const uint32 (e.g. uint32 *), so the pointer should not be const. Therefore this call does not violate Rule 8.13. (If, conversely, the function does not modify the pointed-to value, then the function prototype should declare a pointer-to-const and the absence of const would be a violation \u2014 but based on the code semantics it is intended to be modified.)"
