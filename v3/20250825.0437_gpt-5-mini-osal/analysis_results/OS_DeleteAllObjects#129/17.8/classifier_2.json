  "scenario": "The call itself does not violate Rule 17.8. Passing &ObjectCount allows the callee to modify the pointed-to object (which is permitted). Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter variable inside the callee (i.e. assigning to the pointer parameter itself). A violation would occur only if the implementation of OS_ForEachObjectOfType assigns to its pointer parameter (for example, param = NULL) rather than using it to modify the pointed-to object."
