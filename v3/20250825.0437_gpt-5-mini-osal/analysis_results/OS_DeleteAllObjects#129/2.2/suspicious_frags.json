  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could plausibly be dead/redundant or otherwise need inspection for Rule 2.2 (operations executed whose removal might not change behaviour):\n\n- The three explicit OS_ForEachObjectOfType(...) calls for TIMECB, TIMEBASE and TASK immediately followed by a call to OS_ForEachObject(...) (which iterates over all types) may cause duplicated processing or be redundant in some configurations; whether they are removable without effect depends on ordering/timing semantics and should be checked.\n\n- The switch default: break; is an executed operation when an unknown type is encountered but performs no action; removing it would not change semantics in that branch, so it is a candidate for dead code inspection.\n\n- The trivial wrapper OS_TaskDelay that only forwards to OS_TaskDelay_Impl looks like an indirection that may be removable without changing behaviour (or may exist for a purpose such as abstraction/versioning); it should be reviewed.\n\n- The assignments to the iterator fields (iter->match, iter->arg, iter->limit, iter->base) occur before the call to OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit; if the transaction init fails these assignments are never used, so they may be redundant or unnecessary in failure paths and merit review.\n\n- The unconditional increment ++(*ObjectCount); in OS_CleanUpObject happens before any deletion attempt and also in the default (no-op) case; this modifies the loop-control count even when nothing is deleted and could be misleading or unnecessary.\n\nWhy other code fragments were not included: most other lines perform observable actions that clearly affect program behaviour (e.g. calls that delete resources: OS_TaskDelete, OS_QueueDelete, OS_TimerDelete, OS_TimeBaseDelete; the lock/unlock in OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry; the clock_nanosleep loop in OS_TaskDelay_Impl). Removing those operations would change runtime state or timing and thus are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. Additionally, iterator initialization/usage, iterator destruction, and callback invocation are integral to the object-iteration mechanism and have side effects (locking, callbacks, deletions), so they are not reported as dead-code suspects."
