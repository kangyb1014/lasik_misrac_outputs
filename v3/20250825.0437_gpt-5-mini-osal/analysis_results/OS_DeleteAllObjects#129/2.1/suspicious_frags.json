  "explanation": "I selected the above fragments because they contain control-flow structures and call sites where code could be (or appear to be) unreachable depending on configuration, constants, or iterator behavior. Specific reasons to investigate these areas: - The while(true) loop in OS_DeleteAllObjects and its break condition depend on TryCount, ObjectCount, and the behavior of called functions; this can create either infinite-loop scenarios or code paths that never execute parts of the loop. - The calls to OS_ForEachObjectOfType / OS_ForEachObject are responsible for driving deletion; if the iterator initialization/next functions never succeed for some idtype ranges or if OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER is zero/incorrect, the inner bodies may never execute. - The for-loop in OS_ForEachObject uses OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER as an upper bound; if that macro value is zero or incorrect, the loop body becomes unreachable. - The iterator pattern in OS_ForEachObjectOfType (if-init then while-get-next) can make the while body unreachable when Init succeeds but GetNext immediately fails, or the entire block unreachable if Init never returns OS_SUCCESS. - The switch in OS_CleanUpObject enumerates many object-type cases; some cases might never be reachable if OS_IdentifyObject cannot return those values, or conversely the default branch may be unreachable. Other smaller fragments (variable declarations, simple wrappers such as OS_TaskDelay returning OS_TaskDelay_Impl, macro definitions for individual object-type constants) were not included because they do not by themselves introduce unreachable code: they are declarations or trivial passthroughs without divergent control flow. Likewise, simple increments (++TryCount, ++(*ObjectCount)), assignments, and the break statement inside the switch are normal control-flow constructs whose reachability depends on the higher-level items already flagged above; they do not on their own indicate unreachable code that needs separate investigation."
