  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the supplied code fragments. The code uses only standard C constructs: integer typedefs (uint32 from uint32_t), macros for constant values, normal control-flow (while, for, switch), pointer casts, increment operators, and function calls. There are no GNU/Clang/MSVC extensions such as nested functions, statement-expressions ({: :;}), typeof, __attribute__, __asm__, anonymous/unnamed language-extension members, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific keywords. The use of the identifier true in while (true) is not a compiler extension \u2014 it is the conventional boolean macro supplied by <stdbool.h> in standard C99/C11; if that macro were not defined the code would not compile rather than relying on a compiler extension. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
