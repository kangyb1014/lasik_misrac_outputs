  "explanation": "Only the two lines above invoke functions from <string.h> (memset and strncpy) and therefore are the only candidates that could result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. Other parts of the function do not call any string.h routines: OS_CHECK_POINTER is a pointer-check macro (not a string operation), the OS_ObjectIdGetById / OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET / OS_ObjectIdRelease calls manage object tokens, the simple assignment sock_prop->creator = record->creator does not perform any buffer accesses, and the call to OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl(&token, sock_prop) is an implementation-specific function call (its internals would need separate review but the call site itself does not use <string.h>). No other uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn are present in this function, so no other fragments require investigation for Rule 21.17 in this scope."
