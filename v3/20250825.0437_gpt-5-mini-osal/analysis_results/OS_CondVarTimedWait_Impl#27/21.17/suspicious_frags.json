  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. The operations in the function are: numeric extraction into a struct timespec (limit.tv_sec, limit.tv_nsec), a table lookup via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and POSIX pthread calls (pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cond_timedwait, pthread_cleanup_pop). None of these are string.h functions or wrappers of the listed string functions, so there is no direct risk of accesses beyond object bounds from string handling in this fragment. Note: the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro or the implementations of OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds / OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart could internally use string functions \u2014 if you suspect those implementations, they should be inspected separately. However, within the code shown here there are no string.h usages to investigate under Rule 21.17."
