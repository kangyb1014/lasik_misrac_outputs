  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs and POSIX pthread APIs: local variables, structure access, array indexing via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, calls to pthread_cond_timedwait and pthread_cleanup_push/pop, and standard error constant checks. None of the following are present and thus do not need investigation for Rule 1.2: \u2022 GCC/Clang-specific extensions (e.g., __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... })) \u2022 Compiler-specific keywords or builtins. \u2022 Any inline assembly or vendor-specific pragmas. Note on pthread_cleanup_push/pop: these are POSIX thread macros (library-level), not compiler language extensions as defined by compiler documentation; their use is permitted under Rule 1.2 unless a particular toolchain documents them as a compiler extension. The boolean literal false is a standard identifier from <stdbool.h> in C99 and later; its use is not a compiler extension. All other macros and typedefs shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_condvar_table, OS_time_t, OS_ERROR_*, etc.) are project-defined and do not by themselves constitute compiler language extensions."
