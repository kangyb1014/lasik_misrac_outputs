The function only stores and returns a pointer value (it does not modify the buffer contents), so the pointed-to type could and should be const-qualified (e.g. const void ** or better const void * * depending on intended semantics).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent A misinterprets what the pointer is pointing to. DataBuffer has type void **, i.e. it points to a caller-supplied void* variable, and UT_GetDataBuffer writes to that variable (*DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer). Because the function modifies the object pointed to by DataBuffer (the caller's pointer), that target must be modifiable \u2014 it cannot be const-qualified. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to a const-qualified type only when that is possible; here it is not possible without changing the API semantics. Therefore the reported violation is not correct. (If the API were intended to return a read-only buffer pointer, the signature could be changed to expose a const-qualified pointer type, but that is a design change rather than a MISRA rule violation in the current code.)"
