  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_GetDataBuffer:\n```c\nvoid UT_GetDataBuffer(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, void **DataBuffer, size_t *MaxSize, size_t *Position)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    void *               ResultDataBuffer;\n    size_t               ResultMaxSize;\n    size_t               ResultPosition;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_DATA_BUFFER);\n\n    if (StubPtr == NULL)\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = NULL;\n        ResultMaxSize    = 0;\n        ResultPosition   = 0;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr;\n        ResultMaxSize    = StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize;\n        ResultPosition   = StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position;\n    }\n\n    if (DataBuffer != NULL)\n    {\n        *DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer;\n    }\n    if (MaxSize != NULL)\n    {\n        *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize;\n    }\n    if (Position != NULL)\n    {\n        *Position = ResultPosition;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MaxSize != NULL)\n    {\n        *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize; is only executed when MaxSize != NULL and therefore produces an observable effect (it writes the requested output). Removing that assignment would change program behaviour for callers that pass a non-NULL MaxSize. There is no evidence in the shown code that the assignment is executed yet has no effect (which would be required to call it dead code)."
