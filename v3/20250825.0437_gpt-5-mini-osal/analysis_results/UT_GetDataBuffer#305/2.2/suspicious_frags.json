Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (function signature, local variable declarations, braces/structure of the function, and the void return) are not flagged because they are syntactically required and do not by themselves represent executed operations that could be removed without inspecting call-site behaviour. The variable declarations are used (or potentially used) by the function logic, and the control-flow constructs are necessary to select which values are produced and assigned. There is no other obvious unreachable code within this snippet (no unconditional return, goto, or immediately following unreachable statements). The flagged fragments are the places where assignments and conditional writes may be redundant (for example depending on whether the output pointer arguments are ever NULL or whether UT_GetStubEntry can/does return NULL across all uses) and therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
