  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_GetDataBuffer:\n```c\nvoid UT_GetDataBuffer(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, void **DataBuffer, size_t *MaxSize, size_t *Position)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    void *               ResultDataBuffer;\n    size_t               ResultMaxSize;\n    size_t               ResultPosition;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_DATA_BUFFER);\n\n    if (StubPtr == NULL)\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = NULL;\n        ResultMaxSize    = 0;\n        ResultPosition   = 0;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ResultDataBuffer = StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr;\n        ResultMaxSize    = StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize;\n        ResultPosition   = StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position;\n    }\n\n    if (DataBuffer != NULL)\n    {\n        *DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer;\n    }\n    if (MaxSize != NULL)\n    {\n        *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize;\n    }\n    if (Position != NULL)\n    {\n        *Position = ResultPosition;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (DataBuffer != NULL)\n    {\n        *DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment to *DataBuffer is guarded by a runtime check (DataBuffer != NULL) and is needed to return the buffer pointer to callers that pass a non-NULL out-parameter. Removing that assignment would change program behaviour for those callers, so it is not dead code. (Only in the hypothetical project-wide case where it can be proven that every caller always passes NULL would the assignment never be executed and could be considered redundant \u2014 but that is a separate, project-level analysis, not evident from this function alone.)"
