  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to in this function. The pointer parameters (DataBuffer, MaxSize, Position) are only dereferenced and the objects they point to are written via *DataBuffer, *MaxSize, and *Position \u2014 which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The pointer variables themselves (DataBuffer, MaxSize, Position) and the scalar parameter FuncKey are never assigned to. All other assignments are to local variables (StubPtr, ResultDataBuffer, ResultMaxSize, ResultPosition). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for a Rule 17.8 violation."
