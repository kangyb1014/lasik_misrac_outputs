  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameters ValuePtr and TypeName are already declared with const qualification (const void *ValuePtr, const char *TypeName), so their declarations comply with the rule. Most other assignments and operations in the function involve non-pointer types (integers, enums, sizes, structure fields that are not pointers) and therefore are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. The only places where the const-qualified pointers might be assigned to or passed to entities that could drop the const qualifier are the three fragments listed above (direct assignment to IndirectPtr, assignment to TypeName field, and the call to UT_StoreRetval which may accept a non-const pointer). Those should be inspected to confirm the target fields/parameters are declared with appropriate const qualifiers; all other lines do not present a potential const-qualification violation and so need not be investigated."
