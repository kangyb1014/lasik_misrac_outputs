  "explanation": "To decide whether the function uses any language compiler extensions you must inspect the types, macros and library symbols it relies on and the compilation standard/environment. Specifically:\n\n- UT_IntCheck_t: This typedef could be implemented with a compiler-specific or nonstandard type (e.g. an extended integer type). Knowing its definition is required to determine if a language extension is used.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_t: The radix type may be an enum, macro set, or use nonstandard attributes. Its definition shows whether nonstandard language features are used.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN / UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL / UtAssert_Radix_HEX: The actual constants (and how they are defined) must be checked to ensure they are standard enum/constants and not created with compiler extensions.\n\n- snprintf (declaration / implementation): snprintf is a standard C library function in C99 and later, but some platforms provide nonstandard or macro-backed variants (_snprintf) or other wrappers. Inspecting its declaration/implementation ensures no nonstandard extension is being invoked.\n\n- size_t (typedef): size_t should be the standard typedef from <stddef.h>. If it is redefined or provided by a nonstandard header, that could be an extension.\n\n- bool, true, false (stdbool.h or project macros): The boolean identifiers may come from the standard <stdbool.h> (C99) or from project-specific macros/typedefs. If the latter use compiler extensions, that would violate the rule.\n\n- __STDC_VERSION__ or other compiler standard macro: Knowing the active C standard (or compiler-supplied macros) used when compiling the code is necessary to decide whether a given feature (e.g. snprintf, bool, long long) is standard or an extension for that compilation mode.\n\n- Relevant header(s) that define the UT symbols (project ut-assert header / includes): The header(s) that declare UT_IntCheck_t, UtAssert_Radix_t and any wrappers for snprintf/boolean/size_t must be inspected to find any use of compiler-specific attributes, builtins or macros.\n\nCollectively these symbols/definitions let an analyst determine whether the code in UtAssert_GetValueText relies on nonstandard types, macros or library implementations (i.e. language/compiler extensions) or only on standard C facilities."
