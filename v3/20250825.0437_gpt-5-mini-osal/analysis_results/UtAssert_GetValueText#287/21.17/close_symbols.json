  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA C analysis of potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses you must know the provenance, types and maximum sizes involved. Each symbol below is required for the reasons given: \n\n- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the only caller in the static call graph. You must inspect its implementation to see how it constructs/passes TempBuf and TempSz (and whether it ever passes a NULL pointer or an insufficient TempSz). Whether the target function can write beyond the object depends on the caller(s). \n\n- (the buffer object) TempBuf allocation/size symbol(s) used by callers (e.g. any UTASSERT_*_BUF_SIZE or similar): The actual object and its allocated size (a macro, global buffer, or stack array) determine the valid write bounds. The analysis must know the concrete buffer size(s) used when calling UtAssert_GetValueText. \n\n- UT_IntCheck_t (typedef): The width and signedness of InValue govern how large the textual representation can be after formatting (number of digits, sign). The function casts this type to (long) or (unsigned long) before formatting; knowing the original type and range is needed to compute worst\u2011case formatted length. \n\n- UtAssert_Radix_t and its enum constants (UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN, UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL, UtAssert_Radix_HEX): These control which format string is used (\"true\"/\"false\", \"0%lo\", \"0x%lx\", \"%lu\", \"%ld\"). The chosen format affects maximum output length (prefixes like \"0x\" or leading \"0\", and whether sign is printed). You need the enum definition to ensure there are no additional/unknown cases that change formatting. \n\n- snprintf (declaration/semantics from <stdio.h>): Although MISRA rule cited targets functions in <string.h>, this function uses snprintf from <stdio.h>. You must verify snprintf semantics (it writes at most TempSz bytes including the terminating NUL and returns the number of characters that would have been written) to determine whether truncation prevents out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes. Confirming that the implementation conforms to the standard semantics is necessary to conclude safety. \n\n- platform integer width/limits for long and unsigned long (sizeof(long), LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX, ULONG_MAX): To bound the maximum number of characters produced by the numeric formats (%ld, %lu, %lx, %lo) you need the maximum digit counts for the platform's long/unsigned long. Those limits let you compute an upper bound on characters (digits + optional sign/prefix + NUL) and compare it to TempSz to prove or refute possible overflow. \n\nWith the above symbols you can determine whether any snprintf call in UtAssert_GetValueText can produce more bytes than TempSz (and therefore whether a buffer overrun could occur). Note: the MISRA rule quoted targets use of functions from <string.h>; UtAssert_GetValueText does not directly call those functions, but the safety of TempBuf/TempSz with respect to snprintf must still be established (and the caller(s) inspected) to reason about out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes."
