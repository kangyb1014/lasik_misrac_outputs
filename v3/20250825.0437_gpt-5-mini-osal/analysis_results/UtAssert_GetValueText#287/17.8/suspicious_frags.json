  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies a function parameter itself. Details:\n- TempBuf is passed to snprintf as the destination buffer; this modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter, which is permitted by the rule. The pointer TempBuf itself is never assigned to, incremented, or otherwise modified in the function.\n- TempSz, InValue, IsUnsigned and RadixType are passed by value and are not assigned to anywhere in the function. The code only reads them (comparisons, casts, and passing to snprintf), which does not constitute modification of the parameter.\n- The casts (e.g. (unsigned long)InValue) are value conversions for the call and do not modify the parameter.\n- Returning TempBuf does not modify the parameter.\nBecause there are no assignments to any parameter variables and no pointer parameter is reassigned, there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
