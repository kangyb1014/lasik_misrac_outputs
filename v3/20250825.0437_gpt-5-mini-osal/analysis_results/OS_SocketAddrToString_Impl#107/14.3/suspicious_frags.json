  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not contain other controlling expressions that could be invariant under Rule 14.3. The pointer/union access and the Accessor assignment (Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;) are simple assignments/casts, not control expressions. The typedefs and the OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 #define are declarations or preprocessor config and are not runtime controlling expressions. The return and break statements inside the switch are not separate controlling expressions. No loops (for, while, do-while) are present in this function, so there are no loop-controlling expressions to inspect. Therefore only the switch controlling expression and the if expression that tests the return of inet_ntop are potential controlling expressions that should be investigated for possible invariance; all other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 14.3."
