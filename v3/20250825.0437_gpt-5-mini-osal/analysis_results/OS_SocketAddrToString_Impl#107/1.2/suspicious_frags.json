  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related definitions for constructs that would constitute compiler language extensions (for example: __attribute__/*GNU attributes*/, __extension__, nested functions, typeof, statement expressions, anonymous structs/unions not standardized by C, asm statements, or other compiler-specific keywords). None are present. Specific notes:\n\n- The cast: Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData; is standard C pointer casting, not a compiler extension (though it may raise aliasing or alignment concerns, those are semantic/memory-safety issues, not language-extension use).\n- The union and struct usage (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t containing char array and sockaddr variants) are standard C unions/structs; the conditional inclusion of sockaddr_in6 via #ifdef is standard preprocessor use.\n- The #ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 and related macro definitions are standard preprocessor features; an empty macro definition (\"#define OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 \") is still a standard macro definition and not a compiler extension.\n- Use of inet_ntop and AF_INET/AF_INET6 are library/OS API items (POSIX/Networking), not compiler language extensions.\n- Return statements, switch/case, and other control-flow constructs are standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that use language extensions as defined by compiler documentation, so nothing needs to be reported for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
