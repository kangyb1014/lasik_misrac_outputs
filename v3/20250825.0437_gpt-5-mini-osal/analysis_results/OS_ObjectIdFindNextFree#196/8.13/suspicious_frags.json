  "explanation": "I examined all pointer usages in OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree and found none that are candidates for being changed to point-to-const under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically:\n\n- token (OS_object_token_t *token): the function writes token->obj_idx and token->obj_id, so the pointee is modified and cannot be const.\n- obj (OS_common_record_t *obj): the code assigns to obj->active_id, obj->name_entry, obj->creator and obj->refcount; the record is intentionally modified and thus must be non-const.\n- objtype_state (OS_objtype_state_t *objtype_state): the function reads objtype_state->last_id_issued and later updates objtype_state->last_id_issued; it is therefore a mutable pointee and cannot be const.\n- &token->obj_id passed to OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl: this is an out-parameter written by the callee, so it cannot be const.\n- The pointer obtained from &OS_common_table[...] is used to modify the table entry (see obj modifications above), so it must be non-const.\n\nNo other pointer variables or pointer parameters appear in the function. Because each pointer is used to modify the underlying object (or passed to a function that writes to it), none should be qualified as pointing to const. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13 in this function."
