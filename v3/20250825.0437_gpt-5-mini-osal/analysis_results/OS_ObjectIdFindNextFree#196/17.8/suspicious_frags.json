  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function parameter itself; for pointer parameters the object pointed-to may be modified but the pointer variable shall not be changed. In this function the only parameter is the pointer 'token'. There are no statements that reassign or modify the pointer variable (no occurrences of 'token =', 'token++', or similar). All uses are either reads of token->obj_type or writes to members of the object pointed to (token->obj_idx, token->obj_id via OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl(&token->obj_id)). These member writes modify the pointee, which is explicitly allowed by the rule. Other assignments (e.g., objtype_state = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]; obj = &OS_common_table[...]; and setting fields of obj) do not modify the function parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for a Rule 17.8 violation."
