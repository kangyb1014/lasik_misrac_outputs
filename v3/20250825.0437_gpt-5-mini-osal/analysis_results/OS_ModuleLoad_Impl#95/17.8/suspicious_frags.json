  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies either function parameter. Reasons: \n- Both parameters are declared as pointers to const (const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *translated_path), which prevents modification of the pointed-to objects and indicates they should not be reassigned. \n- The function contains no assignments to token or translated_path (no statements like token = ... or translated_path = ...). \n- The macro use OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token) expands to taking the address of the dereferenced token (i.e. &(*token) which is equivalent to token) and passes it to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken; this is a read-only operation and does not modify the parameter. \n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is defined to take a const OS_object_token_t * and only returns token->obj_idx (a read), so it does not modify the token object or pointer. \n- Assignments in the function (impl = ..., module = ..., impl->dl_handle = dlopen(...)) modify local pointer variables or the objects those local pointers point to, not the function parameters themselves; the rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself, and no such pointer reassignment occurs here. \nGiven these points, there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
