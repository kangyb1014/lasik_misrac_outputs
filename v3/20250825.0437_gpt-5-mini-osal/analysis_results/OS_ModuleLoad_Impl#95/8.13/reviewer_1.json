True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'module' is declared as 'OS_module_internal_record_t *' but in the function it is only used for read access (module->flags). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible, e.g. 'const OS_module_internal_record_t *module', or the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro should return a pointer to const. Since 'module' is not const-qualified here despite only being read, the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In this function the local variable module is only used for read access (module->flags) and therefore could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (for example: const OS_module_internal_record_t *module). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible. Assigning the non-const result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET to a pointer to const is allowed and would satisfy the rule; the impl pointer must remain non-const because it is written to. Thus the reported violation is valid and the code does not comply with Rule 8.13 as written."
