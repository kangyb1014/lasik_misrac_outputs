  "explanation": "No other pointers appear in this function: sem_id is a non-pointer scalar, return_code and token are local non-pointer variables. The only pointer usages are the address-of operator (&token) passed to the two calls above; these should be investigated to determine whether the callee functions modify the pointed-to object or could instead accept a pointer to a const-qualified type. There are no other pointer expressions or declarations in this code that are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
