  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The only function parameter is sem_id, which is passed by value and never assigned to or otherwise modified inside OS_BinSemTake. The other assignments in the function (return_code and token) are to local variables. The addresses of token are passed to other functions (&token) \u2014 this is permitted because the rule allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter in the callee; it only forbids modifying a pointer parameter itself. No pointer parameter of this function is reassigned, so there is no apparent violation of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
