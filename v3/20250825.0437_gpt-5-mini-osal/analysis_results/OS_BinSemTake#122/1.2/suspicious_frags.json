  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function and related symbol definitions for usage of compiler-specific language extensions. No occurrences were found of commonly documented extensions such as: __attribute__, __asm__ / asm, __inline__ (compiler-specific inline), __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }) as an expression, named address spaces, pragma-based extensions, Microsoft-specific keywords, GCC/Clang builtins, nested functions, variable-length arrays used as extensions, or other vendor-specific syntax. The typedefs (int32, osal_id_t, OS_object_token_t) and macro OS_SUCCESS are standard-conforming constructs. The function uses only standard C constructs (declarations, function call, if-statement, return). Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) in the supplied code."
