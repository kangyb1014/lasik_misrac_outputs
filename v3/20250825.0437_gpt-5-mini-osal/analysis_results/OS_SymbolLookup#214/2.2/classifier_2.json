  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SymbolLookup:\n```c\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    int32 staticsym_status;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolAddress);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * attempt to find the symbol in the symbol table\n     */\n    return_code = OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * If the OS call did not find the symbol or the loader is\n     * disabled, then check if a static symbol table is present\n     */\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL);\n\n        /*\n         * Only overwrite the return code if static lookup was successful.\n         * Otherwise keep the error code from the low level implementation.\n         */\n        if (staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            return_code = staticsym_status;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SymbolLookup:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32            status;\n    int32            local_status;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n\n    /* First search global table */\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* If not found iterate through module local symbols and break if found */\n    if (status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE, &iter);\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            local_status = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&iter.token, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n            if (local_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                status = local_status;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Static(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName, const char *ModuleName)\n{\n    int32                      return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n    OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym   = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE;\n\n    while (StaticSym != NULL)\n    {\n        if (StaticSym->Name == NULL)\n        {\n            /* end of list --\n             * Return \"OS_ERROR\" to indicate that an actual search was done\n             * with a not-found result, vs. not searching at all. */\n            return_code = OS_ERROR;\n            break;\n        }\n        if (strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) == 0 &&\n            (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0))\n        {\n            /* found matching symbol */\n            *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address;\n            return_code    = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        ++StaticSym;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nvoid UtAssert_Abort(const char *Message)\n{\n    UT_BSP_DoText(UTASSERT_CASETYPE_ABORT, Message);\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The macro OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL, OS_INVALID_POINTER) which performs a runtime pointer validation (invoking the BUGCHECK/abort handling path when the pointer is NULL). This check is executed and its removal would change program behaviour (e.g. allow a NULL pointer to be used later), so it is not dead code."
