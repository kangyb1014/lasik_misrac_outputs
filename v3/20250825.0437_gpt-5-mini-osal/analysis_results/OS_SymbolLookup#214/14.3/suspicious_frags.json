  "explanation": "I included every controlling expression (if/while and macro-based checks) from the provided code so they can be investigated for invariant evaluation. These are the places where MISRA Rule 14.3 could be violated if the controlling expression is an invariant. Other code fragments were not listed because they are not loop/selection controlling expressions (e.g. assignments, returns, function calls, macro/constant definitions like OS_SUCCESS or OS_INVALID_POINTER, pointer dereferences, increment ++StaticSym, break statements) or they clearly depend on runtime values (e.g. return_code assigned from OS_SymbolLookup_Impl, status/local_status values returned from lookup functions). Those non-listed fragments therefore do not directly raise Rule 14.3 concerns and do not need investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
