  "explanation": "I reviewed all provided functions and macros (OS_SymbolLookup, OS_SymbolLookup_Impl, OS_SymbolLookup_Static, OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl, iterator functions, and OS_CHECK_POINTER macro). No use of the standard library function memcmp is present. The only string comparisons shown use strcmp (in OS_SymbolLookup_Static), which compares null-terminated strings and is not the subject of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for this rule. If there are other source files or omitted snippets that use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, those should be reported separately."
