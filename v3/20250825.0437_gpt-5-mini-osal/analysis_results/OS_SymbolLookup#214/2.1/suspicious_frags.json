  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged because they involve explicit BUGCHECK/abort semantics (the OS_CHECK_POINTER macro and BUGCHECK_VOID usage and the assertion abort function) or the sentinel branch in the static-symbol loop which may be intended as a termination condition and could be misused/never reached depending on how OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is defined. These places can cause control-flow that is not obvious from the local source alone (e.g. non-returning behavior), so they should be investigated for potential unreachable code.\n\nAll other code fragments in the provided functions were not flagged because they exhibit standard, runtime-dependent control flow (returns based on function results, loops that iterate based on iterator functions, conditionals that depend on runtime state). Nothing else in the shown code is statically determinable as unreachable without additional build/environment information (for example the behavior/implementation of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, OS_ObjectIdIterateActive, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl, the contents of OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE, or the exact semantics of BUGCHECK). Those runtime-dependent constructs therefore do not by themselves constitute obviously unreachable code and were not included."
