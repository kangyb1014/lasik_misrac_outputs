  "explanation": "Only pointers that are not modified through indirection and that refer to data that should be immutable need const qualification under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The candidate for missing const is the StaticSym pointer: it appears to point into a static symbol table source (OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) and the code only reads members (Name, Module, Address) and advances the pointer. That suggests the pointee data could be const-qualified (e.g., const OS_static_symbol_record_t *) and should be investigated to avoid dropping const qualification from a presumably read-only static table.\n\nOther pointer usages in the provided code do not need investigation for this rule:\n- The parameter cpuaddr *SymbolAddress is an output parameter (the function stores a value via *SymbolAddress), so the pointer must allow modification of the pointed-to object and should not be const.\n- The parameter const char *SymbolName (and ModuleName in OS_SymbolLookup_Static) are already const-qualified, so they comply with the rule.\n- In OS_SymbolLookup_Impl the iterator (OS_object_iter_t iter) is used to iterate and is passed by address to iterator functions that presumably modify its state; its pointees are intended to be mutable and so should not be const-qualified.\n- Calls that pass SymbolAddress and SymbolName to lower-level lookup functions are passing the appropriate const/non-const types as shown; there is no evidence in the provided code that those lower-level functions accept non-const where const would be possible.\n\nTherefore the only fragment warranting further investigation for Rule 8.13 in the provided code is the use and declaration of StaticSym and its access to the static symbol table."
