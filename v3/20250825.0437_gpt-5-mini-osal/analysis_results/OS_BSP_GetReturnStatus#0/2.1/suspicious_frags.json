  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not present obvious unreachable-code concerns: the local variable declaration and the final \"return retcode;\" are reachable from the function entry; the switch statement evaluates a run-time value (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus) so its branches are potentially reachable. The only possible unreachable-code issues in this snippet arise from the specific case labels/default shown: e.g. duplicate/identical values for OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR (making one case unreachable) or an AppStatus type/value domain that excludes any value outside the two named cases (making the default branch unreachable). Those scenarios require investigation of the listed case/default fragments and the external definitions/types of OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, and AppStatus; no other fragments in this function indicate unreachable code."
