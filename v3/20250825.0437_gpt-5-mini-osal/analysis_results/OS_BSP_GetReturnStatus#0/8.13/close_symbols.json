  "explanation": "To check MISRA A.8 (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) we must confirm whether any pointer indirection occurs in the expression(s) used by OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus. The function itself shows no explicit pointer syntax, but that can be hidden in the declarations: \n\n- OS_BSP_Global: need the declaration/definition of this global to know whether it is an object or a pointer (e.g. \"OS_BSP_Global_t OS_BSP_Global\" vs \"OS_BSP_Global_t *OS_BSP_Global\") and to see any const/volatile qualification on the global itself. If it is a pointer, MISRA requires checking whether it should be a pointer to const.\n\n- (type of) OS_BSP_Global (struct/typedef declaration): the struct/typedef that defines the layout is needed to find the member types and qualifiers; this distinguishes pointer members from scalar members.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (member declaration and type/qualifiers): the type and qualifiers of AppStatus are required to determine if AppStatus is itself a pointer (or contains pointer fields) and whether it is const-qualified. If AppStatus is a pointer, MISRA C pointer-to-const rules apply.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: need the definitions (macros or enum constants) to confirm they are simple integer constants (no hidden pointer semantics) and to check types/qualifiers.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE: need their definitions (typically from <stdlib.h>) to confirm they are integer macros/constants (not pointers) and to ensure no unexpected type/qualifier issues.\n\n- headers/typedefs that define EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE (e.g. <stdlib.h>): to locate their definitions and confirm they are not pointer expressions.\n\nWith these symbols/definitions we can definitively determine whether the code performs any pointer dereference or uses pointer-typed objects that should be const-qualified per the MISRA rule. If none of these declarations introduce pointer types, the function does not violate the rule."
