  "explanation": "The target function has no formal parameters, so to show it cannot violate the MISRA rule about modifying function parameters we must inspect every external symbol it uses to ensure none are (or expand to) parameters or have side effects that could modify a parameter elsewhere. Specifically:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: needed to confirm this is a global object (not an alias or macro that expands to an expression involving a function parameter) and to see how it is declared (object vs. macro/function-like).\n- type/definition of OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus: needed to verify AppStatus is a simple data member read here (not a macro with hidden assignments or a function call) and to know its type (enum/int) for case-label semantics.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: needed to confirm these are compile-time constants (enum or #define) and not macros that could have side effects or parameter modifications.\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE: needed to confirm these are simple macros (from <stdlib.h>) and do not expand to expressions that modify parameters.\n\nExamining these symbols lets the analyzer prove the function performs only reads of globals/constants and local writes (retcode), and therefore does not modify any function parameter (satisfying the MISRA rule)."
