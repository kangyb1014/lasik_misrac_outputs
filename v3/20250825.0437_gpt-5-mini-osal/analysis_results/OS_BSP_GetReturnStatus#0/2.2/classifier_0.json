Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus:\n```c\nint OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus(void)\n{\n    int retcode;\n\n    switch (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus)\n    {\n        case OS_SUCCESS:\n            /* translate OS_SUCCESS to the system EXIT_SUCCESS value (usually 0) */\n            retcode = EXIT_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n\n        case OS_ERROR:\n            /* translate OS_ERROR to the system EXIT_FAILURE value (usually 1) */\n            retcode = EXIT_FAILURE;\n            break;\n\n        default:\n            /* any other value will be passed through (implementation-defined) */\n            /* Range is limited to 0-127, however */\n            retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return retcode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndefault:\n            /* any other value will be passed through (implementation-defined) */\n            /* Range is limited to 0-127, however */\n            retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F;\n            break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The default case assigns retcode to a masked AppStatus value and is executed whenever OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus is neither OS_SUCCESS nor OS_ERROR. This is meaningful behavior and its removal would change program behaviour for those AppStatus values, so it is not dead code. (A possible violation scenario would be if, elsewhere in the function, retcode were always overwritten after the switch before being used \u2014 then this assignment would be executed but redundant and thus dead code.)"
