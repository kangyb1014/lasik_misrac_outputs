  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus:\n```c\nint OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus(void)\n{\n    int retcode;\n\n    switch (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus)\n    {\n        case OS_SUCCESS:\n            /* translate OS_SUCCESS to the system EXIT_SUCCESS value (usually 0) */\n            retcode = EXIT_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n\n        case OS_ERROR:\n            /* translate OS_ERROR to the system EXIT_FAILURE value (usually 1) */\n            retcode = EXIT_FAILURE;\n            break;\n\n        default:\n            /* any other value will be passed through (implementation-defined) */\n            /* Range is limited to 0-127, however */\n            retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return retcode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncase OS_ERROR:\n            /* translate OS_ERROR to the system EXIT_FAILURE value (usually 1) */\n            retcode = EXIT_FAILURE;\n            break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general. The case label assigns EXIT_FAILURE when AppStatus == OS_ERROR and therefore affects behavior when that value occurs. It would only be dead code if removal would not change behaviour \u2014 e.g. if OS_ERROR & 0x7F == EXIT_FAILURE (so the default branch would produce the same value) or if OS_ERROR can never occur at runtime (the AppStatus value is never set to OS_ERROR). In those specific situations the assignment would be redundant and thus violate Rule 2.2."
