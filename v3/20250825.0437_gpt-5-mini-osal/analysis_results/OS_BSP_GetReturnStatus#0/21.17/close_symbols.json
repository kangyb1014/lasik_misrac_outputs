  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to assess the MISRA C string-handling-bounds rule for OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global (definition/decl): The function reads OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus; you must see the global variable/struct definition to know layout, visibility and any side effects.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (member): The exact member accessed; need its declaration to know its type, bit-width, and signedness which affect masking (& 0x7F) and whether any implicit conversions could cause out-of-bounds behavior elsewhere.\n\n- type/enum definition of AppStatus: If AppStatus is an enum or typedef, its underlying range/representation (signed/unsigned, width) determines whether values can be outside 0\u2013127 and whether the mask or return conversion is well defined.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR (macro/enum values): The switch compares AppStatus to these symbols; their values and types are required to determine whether any conversion/promotion could produce unexpected results or trigger code paths that might call string functions indirectly.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE (macros): The function maps OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR to these system macros; their values are implementation-defined and must be known to ensure no implicit assumptions lead to undefined behavior or to check if their use interacts with string-handling elsewhere.\n\n- OS_BSP_Initialize, OS_Application_Startup, OS_Application_Run (functions): These functions appear in the static call graph as peers/callers of OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus (and are likely writers or initializers of AppStatus). To demonstrate the target function does not cause or rely on any string.h usage, you must inspect these routines for any direct or indirect uses of string.h functions or for writes to AppStatus that could produce values causing later code to misuse string functions.\n\n- main (function): As the caller that invokes OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus, main (and the code it calls) must be checked for any use of the returned value that leads to string.h functions or out-of-bounds string accesses (for example, using the return value to size buffers or as an index in string operations).\n\n- Any translation unit/global sites that call or write OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus: All writers to AppStatus must be inspected to bound the possible values stored and to ensure no string.h functions are invoked with pointers/lengths derived from AppStatus that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- Project headers that define/declare string.h functions or macros (e.g. inclusion of <string.h>): To establish conformance to the MISRA rule you must find all uses of the standard string functions in the translation unit(s) reachable from this code; presence/absence of these headers and the locations of their use are needed to prove no out-of-bounds string operations are reachable.\n\nNote: OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus itself does not call any string.h functions. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to prove (by inspection of types, value ranges and reachable call sites/writers) that no string-handling functions can be invoked in a way that would access beyond object bounds as a result of this function or values it reads/returns."
