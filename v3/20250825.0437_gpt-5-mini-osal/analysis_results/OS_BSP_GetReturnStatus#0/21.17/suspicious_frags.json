  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function contains only integer variables, a switch on OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus, assignments of integer macros (EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE), and a bitwise mask (AppStatus & 0x7F). It does not call any of the string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) nor does it perform any pointer arithmetic or character/array accesses that could relate to string handling. Therefore there are no code locations in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
