  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: dp is a pointer to an opaque DIR object returned by opendir and is stored in OS_impl_dir_table as DIR*. POSIX directory APIs (readdir, closedir, etc.) and the existing table expect DIR*, so the pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified here. (It would be a violation only if the pointed-to object were never modified and all uses accepted const DIR*, which is not the case.)"
