  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Specifically:\n- The only conditional, if (dp == NULL), depends on dp which is assigned from opendir(local_path) and so is not a compile-time or runtime invariant.\n- There are no loop constructs (for, while, do-while) whose controlling expressions could be invariant; the code contains no iteration statements to check against Rule 14.3.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returns token->obj_idx, so the index is derived from the input token (not invariant). The macro invocation with *token resolves to &(*token) -> token, so it does not introduce an invariant controlling expression.\n- Returning the macros OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS is not relevant to Rule 14.3 because they are used as return values, not as controlling expressions.\nGiven the absence of invariant controlling expressions and of any loops, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
