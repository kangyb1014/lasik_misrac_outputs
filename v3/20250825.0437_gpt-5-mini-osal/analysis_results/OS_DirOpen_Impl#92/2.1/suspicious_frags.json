  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present in the provided function. There are no constant conditional expressions, unconditional returns or jumps that make subsequent statements impossible to execute (e.g. no if (0), return immediately followed by code, #if 0 blocks, or similar constructs). The only conditional return (if (dp == NULL) return OS_ERROR;) depends on the runtime result of opendir(), so the subsequent assignments and the return OS_SUCCESS are reachable at runtime when opendir() succeeds. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to use the address of the dereferenced token (effectively the original token pointer) and is used in a context that does not introduce compile-time unreachable code. Any issues such as null token pointers, invalid indices from OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, or runtime failures of opendir() are potential runtime errors or undefined behavior, but they do not constitute statically unreachable code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 and therefore do not require further investigation for this rule."
