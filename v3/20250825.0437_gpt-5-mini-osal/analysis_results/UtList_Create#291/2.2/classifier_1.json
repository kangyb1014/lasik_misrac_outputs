  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Create:\n```c\nUtListHead_t *UtList_Create(uint32 NumTags)\n{\n    struct ListAllocator\n    {\n        UtListHead_t Head;\n        UtListNode_t Tags[];\n    };\n    struct ListAllocator *NewList;\n    UtListNode_t *        TagHead;\n    size_t                ActualSize;\n    uint32                i;\n\n    ActualSize = sizeof(struct ListAllocator) + (sizeof(UtListNode_t) * NumTags);\n    NewList    = (struct ListAllocator *)malloc(ActualSize);\n\n    memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n\n    NewList->Head.Tags         = NewList->Tags;\n    NewList->Head.NumberOfTags = NumTags;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < NumTags; ++i)\n    {\n        TagHead       = &NewList->Head.Tags[i];\n        TagHead->Tag  = i;\n        TagHead->Next = TagHead;\n        TagHead->Prev = TagHead;\n    }\n\n    return &NewList->Head;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nTagHead->Tag  = i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not violated in this code: the assignment TagHead->Tag = i; initializes the node\u2019s Tag field for later use and therefore affects program behaviour. It is not dead code here. A concrete violation scenario would be if the Tag member is never read anywhere in the entire project (no accesses, no observable side\u2011effects, and not volatile) \u2014 in that case the write would be an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour, making it dead code."
