  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 in UtList_Create. The function has a single parameter (NumTags) passed by value and it is not modified anywhere in the function. There are no pointer parameters to the function whose value might be changed. All modifications in the function are to local variables (NewList, TagHead, i, ActualSize) and to memory allocated on the heap (fields of the allocated structure and its nodes). Modifying objects in allocated memory or local variables does not violate Rule 17.8; the rule only prohibits modifying function parameters (or changing the value of pointer parameters themselves). Therefore no fragments in the provided code violate Rule 17.8."
