  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (loops/conditionals). The only controlling expression in this function is the for-loop shown above, so it is the sole fragment requiring investigation. Other parts of the function (struct declarations, allocations, memset, assignments, return) do not contain controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and need not be investigated for this rule."
