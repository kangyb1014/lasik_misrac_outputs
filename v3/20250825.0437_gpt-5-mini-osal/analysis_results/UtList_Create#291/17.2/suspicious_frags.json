  "explanation": "No function in the provided code calls itself, either directly or indirectly, based on the fragments shown. UtList_Create does not contain any calls to UtList_Create (or to any other project function) \u2014 it only calls standard library functions malloc and memset. The loop initializes node pointers (TagHead->Next = TagHead; TagHead->Prev = TagHead;) which are self-referential pointer assignments but are not function calls and therefore not recursion. The only caller shown, UtTest_EarlyInit, calls UtList_Create (one-way); there is no evidence in the provided code that UtList_Create calls back into UtTest_EarlyInit or any other function that would form a recursion cycle. The nested struct definition inside UtList_Create and the use of standard library functions do not introduce recursion by themselves. If there are additional, unshown functions or nonstandard overrides (e.g., custom malloc/memset wrappers) elsewhere in the codebase that call UtList_Create, those would need to be inspected, but no such evidence exists in the supplied fragments."
