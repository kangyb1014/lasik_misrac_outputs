  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Create violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer must know all functions that could participate in a call cycle involving UtList_Create. The following additional symbols are needed and why:\n\n- UtTest_EarlyInit: This function is listed as a caller of UtList_Create in the static call graph. Its body and its transitive callees must be inspected to ensure there is no path from UtList_Create back to UtTest_EarlyInit (or another function) that eventually calls UtList_Create, which would create an indirect recursion.\n\n- OS_Application_Startup: This is listed as a caller of UtTest_EarlyInit. It must be examined for the same reason as above \u2014 to ensure that higher-level callers do not create a cycle that reaches back to UtList_Create via other call paths.\n\n- malloc: UtList_Create calls malloc. Although usually a library allocator will not call application functions, the concrete implementation (or any wrapper used in the project) could invoke callbacks that lead back into application code. The allocator implementation (or any project-specific wrapper) must be checked to ensure it does not call into code that could eventually call UtList_Create.\n\n- memset: UtList_Create calls memset. Similarly, the actual implementation or any project-specific wrapper (or macro) should be checked to ensure it does not call application functions that could participate in a call cycle.\n\nIn short, to prove absence of direct or indirect self-calls for UtList_Create you must examine the bodies/transitive callees of all functions it calls (malloc, memset, or wrappers) and of functions that call it (UtTest_EarlyInit, OS_Application_Startup) to ensure there is no path from UtList_Create back to itself."
