  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the function parameter (the pointer token) itself. The function only dereferences *token to index the object table (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)) and assigns the result to a local pointer impl; there is no assignment to token or pointer arithmetic on token. The parameter is declared as pointer-to-const (const OS_object_token_t *token), preventing modification of the pointed-to object via token; the only object modified is the mutex referenced by impl->id via pthread_mutex_destroy, which is not the function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. (Note: macro expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is not shown; based on its use here it does not assign to the token parameter.)"
