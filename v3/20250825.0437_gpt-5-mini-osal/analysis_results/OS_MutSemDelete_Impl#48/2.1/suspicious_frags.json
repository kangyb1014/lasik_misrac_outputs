  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Each statement can be reached in normal execution: the impl pointer assignment is executed first, the call to pthread_mutex_destroy always executes, and the conditional (status != 0) can evaluate either true or false so both the return OS_SEM_FAILURE and the final return OS_SUCCESS are reachable. There are no constant conditional expressions, no code after an unconditional return, no dead labels or unreachable branches, and the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to a valid expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) that does not introduce unreachable code. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
