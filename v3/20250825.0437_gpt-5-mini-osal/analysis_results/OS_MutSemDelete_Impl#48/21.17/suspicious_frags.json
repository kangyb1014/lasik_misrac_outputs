  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The rule concerns use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided function OS_MutSemDelete_Impl and the related definitions do not use any of these functions or any other <string.h> APIs:\n\n- OS_MutSemDelete_Impl calls pthread_mutex_destroy and performs an array lookup via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro. No string.h functions are called.\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro that computes an address from an index derived by OS_ObjectIndexFromToken; it does not invoke any string handling routine.\n- OS_impl_mutex_table is an array of OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t; its definition contains no string operations.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns a field from the token; it does not perform string operations.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that could violate Rule 21.17 in the supplied code. (Note: potential out-of-bounds array indexing or incorrect token values are implementation correctness concerns but are outside the scope of Rule 21.17, which specifically targets use of <string.h> functions.)"
