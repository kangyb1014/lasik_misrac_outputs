  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related code for uses of the standard <string.h> functions named (or similar) that can read/write via caller-supplied pointers and therefore risk accessing memory beyond object bounds (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). None of those functions appear in OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish or in the accompanying helper functions. The only use of a string-library-like function is strerror(ret) inside the lock/unlock implementation, but strerror is not one of the listed buffer-manipulating functions and it does not copy into caller-provided buffers (it returns a pointer to an internal/static message). Other potentially risky code constructs (indexing OS_common_table in OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, use of printf-style formatting in OS_DEBUG, mutex/cond operations) do not involve the <string.h> functions targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so they are outside the scope of this rule. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
