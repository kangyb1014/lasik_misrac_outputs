  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish:\n```c\nvoid OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(OS_object_token_t *token, const osal_id_t *final_id)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        /* nothing to do */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    record = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n\n    /* re-acquire global table lock to adjust refcount */\n    if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE || token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT)\n    {\n        OS_Lock_Global(token);\n    }\n\n    if (record->refcount > 0)\n    {\n        --record->refcount;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * at this point the global mutex is always held, either\n     * from re-acquiring it above or it is still held from\n     * the original lock when using OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL.\n     *\n     * If an ID update was pending (i.e. for a create/delete op)\n     * then do the ID update now while holding the mutex.\n     */\n    if (final_id != NULL)\n    {\n        record->active_id = *final_id;\n    }\n    else if (token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE)\n    {\n        /*\n         * If the lock type was EXCLUSIVE, it means that the ID in the record\n         * was reset to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.
