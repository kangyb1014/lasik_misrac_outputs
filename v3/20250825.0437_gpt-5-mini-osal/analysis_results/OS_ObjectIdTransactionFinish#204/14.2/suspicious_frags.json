  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-statements are present in the provided code fragments (OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_Lock_Global, OS_Unlock_Global and the typedefs). MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and their three clauses; since there are no for loops in the shown code, there are no fragments to investigate for this rule. Note: the functions OS_Lock_Global_Impl and OS_Unlock_Global_Impl are invoked but their implementations are not provided here; if those implementations (or any other omitted functions/macros) contain for loops, those should be inspected for Rule 14.2 compliance. Based on the supplied source text, however, all visible code is free of for loops and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.2."
