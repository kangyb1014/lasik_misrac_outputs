  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types or they involve pointer accesses that clearly modify the pointed-to object (and therefore legitimately require a non-const pointer). Examples of non-relevant code include control-flow constructs, literal values, comments, and macro/type definitions (e.g. OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED and typedefs). Pointer dereferences that perform explicit modifications of the underlying object (such as decrementing a refcount or assigning to record fields) are expected to need non-const pointers, so they were not separately reported beyond the items listed above. The listed fragments are those places where pointer types and pointer-returning calls appear and therefore warrant closer review for appropriate const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
