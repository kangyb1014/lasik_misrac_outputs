  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. In OS_Unlock_Global_Impl the parameter idtype is only read (used to index OS_impl_objtype_lock_table) and never assigned to. The local variable impl is assigned from the table (a local change, not a parameter modification). The only apparent modifications in the shown code are to members of the object pointed to by token (token->lock_key and objtype->owner_key) in OS_Unlock_Global \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is explicitly allowed by the rule; the pointer variable token itself is not reassigned. Calls that take addresses (e.g. &impl->cond, &impl->mutex) pass pointers to members but do not modify any function parameter. OS_impl_objtype_lock_table is defined as an array of const pointers, so the table entries are not being altered here. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and no other fragments require investigation for this rule."
