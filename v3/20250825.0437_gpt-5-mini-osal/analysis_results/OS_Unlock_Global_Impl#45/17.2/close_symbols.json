  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Unlock_Global_Impl participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the upward call chain from the function: \n- OS_Unlock_Global \u2014 immediate caller of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl; any call path from OS_Unlock_Global back to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl would create indirect recursion. \n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel \u2014 caller of OS_Unlock_Global; include its body (and any functions it calls) to see if it (directly or through further calls) can reach OS_Unlock_Global_Impl or OS_Unlock_Global. \n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken \u2014 caller of OS_Unlock_Global; include to check for call paths that could form a cycle. \n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish \u2014 caller of OS_Unlock_Global; include for the same reason. \n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry \u2014 caller of OS_Unlock_Global; include for the same reason. \nIn short, these symbols are required because MISRA recursion detection requires analyzing callers (and their callees) to find any path that returns to the target; you must examine each listed caller's implementation and any functions they call (including indirect calls via function pointers) to conclusively determine whether a recursion cycle exists."
