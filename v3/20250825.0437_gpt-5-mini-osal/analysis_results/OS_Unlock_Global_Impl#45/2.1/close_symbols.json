  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The target function indexes into this table with idtype and tests the result for NULL. To decide whether the if (impl != NULL) block can ever be entered (or is therefore unreachable), the table definition and contents/size must be known.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct type of table entries is used in the function (impl->cond, impl->mutex). Its definition confirms these members exist and that the dereference is valid; also helps determine whether any compile-time guarantees force entries to be non-NULL.\n- osal_objtype_t: The index type used to access the table. Knowing its underlying representation and allowed value range (enum bounds) is necessary to determine whether all possible idtype values always yield valid, non-NULL table entries or could index out-of-range/point to NULL.\n- OS_Unlock_Global: This caller wraps/forwards to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl. Examining its implementation shows what idtype values are passed in normal usage and whether certain paths to the Impl function are impossible, which affects reachability analysis.\n- The code that initializes/assigns OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (static initializer or runtime init function): If the table is fully populated at compile-time (no NULLs) then the if-block may be unreachable; if the table is populated at runtime or left with NULLs for some types, the block may be reachable. The initializer or init routine is required to decide this.\n- Any functions that modify OS_impl_objtype_lock_table entries (creation/destroy routines that can set entries NULL): Runtime routines that create/destroy or update the table can make entries NULL or non-NULL over time. To determine if the conditional block can ever execute, these mutation sites must be checked.\n\nNote: pthread_cond_broadcast(), pthread_mutex_unlock(), OS_DEBUG(), and strerror() are not required to determine reachability (they do not affect whether the if-condition can be true), so they are omitted."
