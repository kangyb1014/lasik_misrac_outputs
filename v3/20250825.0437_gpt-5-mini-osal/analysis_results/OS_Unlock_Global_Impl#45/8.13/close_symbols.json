  "explanation": "OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: need the complete type definition (and member types/names) to know whether members are mutable and thus whether a pointer-to-const would be possible. In particular, the code takes &impl->cond and &impl->mutex \u2014 if those members are non-const, impl cannot be const.\n\nOS_impl_objtype_lock_table: need the declaration (type and const-qualification of the array and its elements) to see whether the table already exposes const pointers or mutable pointers; it determines what pointer type is actually stored/expected and whether changing impl to a pointer-to-const is compatible.\n\npthread_cond_broadcast: need the prototype to confirm whether it takes a pointer to a non-const pthread_cond_t (i.e., pthread_cond_t *) \u2014 if it requires a non-const pointer, impl cannot be const-compatible because the member address is passed to a non-const parameter.\n\npthread_mutex_unlock: need the prototype to confirm whether it takes a pointer to a non-const pthread_mutex_t (i.e., pthread_mutex_t *) \u2014 same reasoning as for the cond function.\n\npthread_cond_t and pthread_mutex_t: need the actual types of these members (as used inside OS_impl_objtype_lock_t) to confirm mutability expectations and parameter compatibility with the pthread functions.\n\nosal_objtype_t: need the typedef/enum for the index type used to index OS_impl_objtype_lock_table to ensure the table indexing/constness relationship and to check whether idtype is passed or used in a way that affects const qualification.\n\n(These symbols are the minimal set required to decide whether the pointer 'impl' could/should be declared pointing-to-const under MISRA\u2019s \u201cpointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d rule, since the decisive facts are the type/constness of the table entries, the member types, and the prototypes of the functions that receive member addresses.)"
