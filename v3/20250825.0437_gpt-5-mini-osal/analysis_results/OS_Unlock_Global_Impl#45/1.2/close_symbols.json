  "explanation": "For determining whether OS_Unlock_Global_Impl uses any compiler/language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions/expansions of the identifiers referenced by the function. Each symbol below is required and why:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The pointer type for impl. Its definition may include compiler-specific extensions (e.g. unnamed/anonymous structs/unions, __attribute__ markers, typeof, packed/align directives, flexible/variable length members implemented as extensions). Need the full type to detect such extensions.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The global array/object indexed by idtype. Its declaration/definition may use compiler extensions (section attributes, custom linkage, macros that expand to compiler-specific constructs). Also its type determines what impl points to.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The parameter type used to index the table. If this is a typedef, enum, or macro it might be defined using extensions (e.g. extended enums, bitfields, compiler attributes). Need its definition to ensure no extension is used in the signature or indexing expression.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: A macro or function used for diagnostics. Macros commonly employ extensions (variadic GNU macros, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ or __builtin_ helpers). Inspecting OS_DEBUG expansion is necessary to detect any non-standard constructs.\n\n- pthread_cond_broadcast: A called symbol which may be a macro wrapper around a compiler/OS-specific implementation. Its declaration may use compiler-specific attributes or macros \u2014 need to confirm it is a standard POSIX function and not a compiler extension.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: Same rationale as pthread_cond_broadcast \u2014 check whether the symbol is provided as a plain POSIX function or via compiler/implementation-specific macro/extension.\n\n- strerror: The diagnostics helper used in the OS_DEBUG call. strerror could be a macro or inline wrapper with attributes or builtins; its declaration/definition should be checked for extensions.\n\n- pthread_cond_t: The type of impl->cond. The definition of this type (often an opaque struct/union) may contain implementation-specific or compiler-specific features (anonymous members, attributes, platform-specific layout) that could be extensions.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: The type of impl->mutex. As with pthread_cond_t, its definition may include non-standard constructs dependent on the implementation; inspect to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- NULL: The macro/identifier used in the comparison (impl != NULL). Some environments define NULL in non-standard ways; verifying its definition ensures no extension is being used here.\n\nIn short: to assess MISRA's prohibition on language/compiler extensions you must examine the actual type and macro/function definitions referenced by the function (types, global objects, and macros/wrappers). The symbols above cover the declarations/definitions that can introduce such extensions in this function."
