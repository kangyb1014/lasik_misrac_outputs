  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. All conditional tests depend on the variable return_code set at runtime (e.g. if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)), so they are not constant expressions. There are no for/while/do-while loops or other control statements with compile-time constant conditions in the shown functions. The macro OS_SUCCESS is a constant (0), but it is only used in comparisons against a variable, which does not make the controlling expression invariant. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
