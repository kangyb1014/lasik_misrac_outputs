  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions were found in the provided code fragments. I looked for common, documented compiler extensions such as identifiers beginning with __ (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__), GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({ ...; }) and ({ ... }) usage, typeof, nested functions, inline assembly, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or other non-standard syntax. The code only uses standard C constructs (functions, typedefs, casts), standard integer typedefs (int32_t/uint32_t), and POSIX library calls (lseek, strerror, errno) which are library/API usage rather than language/compiler extensions. Note: some identifiers in the code are macros (for example OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_DEBUG) whose definitions were not provided. Their usage in this code does not itself demonstrate a language extension; if those macro definitions contain compiler-specific extensions then those definitions would need to be examined, but they are not present in the supplied fragments, so they cannot be reported here."
