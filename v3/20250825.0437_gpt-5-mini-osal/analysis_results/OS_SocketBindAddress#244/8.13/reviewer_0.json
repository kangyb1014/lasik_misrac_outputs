For example, if stream->stream_name is declared as 'const char *' (pointer to const data) and record->name_entry is declared as 'char *' (pointer to non-const), then record->name_entry = stream->stream_name; discards the const qualifier and allows the possibility of modifying const data \u2014 this violates Rule 8.13. If, however, both fields have the same const qualification (e.g. both are 'const char *' or both are 'char *'), then this single assignment does not by itself violate Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The claim is not proven by the snippet. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is a \u2018should\u2019 recommending that pointers point to const-qualified types when possible. The potentially problematic line is:\n\n    record->name_entry = stream->stream_name;\n\nWhether this violates 8.13 depends entirely on the declarations of record->name_entry and stream->stream_name. If both have the same qualifier (e.g. both are 'char *' or both are 'const char *') then there is no violation. If stream->stream_name is 'const char *' and record->name_entry is 'char *' then the assignment would discard const qualification (and, in standard C, would be a type-incompatible assignment without a cast) \u2014 that would both be a C type-qualification issue and run counter to the intent of Rule 8.13. Because the code excerpt does not show the field types, you cannot conclude that Rule 8.13 is violated. Recommendation: inspect the declarations of stream_name and name_entry; if the destination should not allow modification of the pointed data, declare it as a pointer-to-const or otherwise document/cast intentionally."
