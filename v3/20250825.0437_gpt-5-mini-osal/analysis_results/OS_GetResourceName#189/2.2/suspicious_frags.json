Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were omitted because they are clearly necessary for observable program behaviour or are simple declarations/returns that cannot be dead code on their own. Specifically:\n- Declarations (int32 return_code; size_t name_len; OS_common_record_t *record; OS_object_token_t token;) are not executable operations and thus are not candidates for dead code.\n- The outer if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) and the check if (record->name_entry != NULL) control whether the operations execute; they are essential control-flow elements and not themselves dead.\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(...) and use of the returned record pointer are included above where relevant; other internal helper functions (OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById and its transaction logic) perform side effects (object lookup, locking) so their invocation is necessary and cannot be assumed dead without system-wide analysis \u2014 only the specific call sites listed above are flagged for further review.\n- The final return return_code; is the function result and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n\nThe fragments listed should be investigated because they are executable operations that might be redundant in some configurations or workloads (for example: initialization that is always overwritten, checks/macros that may be no-ops in some builds, copies/terminations that may always be overridden, or release calls that may be unnecessary depending on how tokens/locks are managed). Other code in the function either provides necessary control flow or performs side effects that make them unlikely to be dead code, so they were not flagged."
