  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions in the provided code that could be invariant. The function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback contains only an assignment and a function-pointer call; there are no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (? :) operators present. The related type definitions (the union and the typedef for osal_id_t) also contain no control-flow statements. Therefore there are no candidate code fragments in the supplied code that would need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant)."
