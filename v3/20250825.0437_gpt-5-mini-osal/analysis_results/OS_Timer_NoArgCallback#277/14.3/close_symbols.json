  "explanation": "- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t: The function uses a local variable of this struct type (Conv). You must see its definition to know the types of its members (especially timer_callback_func and opaque_arg) and to ensure no macros/hidden constructs in the member declarations could introduce control constructs inside what appears to be a simple member access/call.\\n- timer_callback_func (member type) / OS_SimpleCallback_t: The precise typedef or prototype for the callback member is required to confirm that (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid) is an ordinary function-pointer call (not a macro or an inline wrapper that could contain loops or invariant controlling expressions). Also confirms the parameter/return types so there are no surprising constant expressions used as controlling expressions via the call.\\n- osal_id_t: The type of objid must be known (typedef or enum) to rule out any exotic definitions (e.g., a macro or enum constant) that could affect whether any controlling expression in this translation unit is invariant.\\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule under examination concerns invariant controlling expressions (loops/conditionals). The target function itself contains no explicit controlling expressions, so to be certain it does not hide any (via macros, typedefs, or unusual member definitions) you must inspect the definitions of the struct and the callback type and the objid type. These symbols are the minimal set needed to verify there are no hidden/inlined control constructs that would make a controlling expression invariant within this function."
