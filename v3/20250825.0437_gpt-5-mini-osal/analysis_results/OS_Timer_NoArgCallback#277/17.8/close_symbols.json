  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Timer_NoArgCallback modifies any of its parameters (violating MISRA rule), the analyzer must know the exact types and member declarations involved:\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t: The struct type of Conv. You must see its full definition to understand what assignment Conv.opaque_arg = arg does (is opaque_arg a void*, a void**, an integer, etc.). If opaque_arg is a pointer type, the assignment copies the pointer value (does not modify the parameter itself); if it were a reference to the original pointer (e.g., a pointer-to-pointer stored elsewhere) the semantics could differ.\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t::opaque_arg: Explicitly inspect this member's type to confirm that storing arg into it does not modify the function parameter variable 'arg' itself (only copies the pointer value) and to verify whether subsequent use could alter the pointer variable rather than the pointee.\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t::timer_callback_func: Inspect this member's declared type to know what arguments the callback expects. If the callback signature takes a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise could modify the pointer argument, that matters for whether the parameter is being modified through an alias.\n\n- OS_SimpleCallback_t: The typedef (mentioned in the comment) likely defines the callback function-pointer type. Knowing its prototype (parameter types and whether parameters are pointers) is necessary to determine whether invoking (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid) could modify objid (if objid is a pointer type) or would only read it.\n\n- osal_id_t: The typedef of objid. If osal_id_t is itself a pointer type, the MISRA rule's distinction between modifying the pointer vs. the pointee becomes relevant. If it's an integer type, there is no pointer modification concern for objid.\n\nTogether, these symbols let the analyzer decide if the function reassigns or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (arg or objid) or only copies/passes the values or modifies the pointees (which is allowed)."
