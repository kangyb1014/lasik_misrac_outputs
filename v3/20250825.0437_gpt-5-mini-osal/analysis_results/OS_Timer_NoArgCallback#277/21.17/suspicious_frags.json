  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) potentially causing out-of-bounds accesses. The provided function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback and the related typedefs do not call or reference any of these string.h functions, nor do they perform any direct buffer copies, memory sets, comparisons, or string operations. The only notable operations are assigning a void* into a union member and invoking a function pointer; these are not string handling calls and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Consequently there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
