  "scenario": "The call expression (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid) is reachable: it is executed when OS_Timer_NoArgCallback runs and there is no preceding unconditional return, infinite loop, or other construct making it unreachable. A Rule 2.1 violation would require this statement to be impossible to execute (for example if it were placed after an unconditional return or inside code guarded by a condition that can never be true), which is not the case in the provided fragment."
