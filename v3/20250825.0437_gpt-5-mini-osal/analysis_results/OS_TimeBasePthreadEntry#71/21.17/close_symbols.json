  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they\u2019re needed to check for violations of the <string.h> bounds rule:\n\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread\n  - Direct callee of the target function. Its implementation must be inspected to see whether it (or functions it calls) use any string.h functions or perform pointer/length operations that could access out-of-bounds memory.\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t\n  - Type of the local_arg used to carry the pthread argument into OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. The union/struct layout (members names, sizes, and which member is used) is required to ensure the pointer-to-id conversion is valid and does not cause misinterpreted pointer arithmetic or out-of-bounds access.\n\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl\n  - One of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread\u2019s callees (per the static call graph). Its body must be checked for use of memcpy/memmove/strcpy/etc. or for buffer/length assumptions that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Functions that retrieve object records may copy or compare identifier strings or buffers; its implementation is required to evaluate any string.h usage and buffer size handling.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Token-to-index conversions may involve string or memory operations; inspect implementation for any potential out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Releasing IDs may perform memory operations on identifier fields\u2014its code must be checked for string.h usage and bounds handling.\n\n- OS_TaskDelay_Impl\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Although timing-related, it may still call helpers that use string/memory functions indirectly; include to be thorough in the call tree analysis.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Locking helpers may reference shared structures or buffers; their implementations must be inspected for any memory/string operations affecting bounds.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. As with the lock, unlock may touch shared data; include to ensure no indirect string.h usage or unsafe buffer access.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Equality checks for object IDs are likely to use memcmp/strcmp or similar; its implementation is directly relevant to the MISRA <string.h> rule.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFromToken\n  - Callee of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. Converting tokens to IDs may involve building or copying identifier strings/buffers; its implementation must be inspected for correct bounds usage.\n\n- OS_object_id_t\n  - Type used by the object-id related functions. The layout/size of identifier fields (arrays, pointers) is necessary to determine whether any string/memory operations in the callees can access beyond buffer bounds.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - Token type used by the object-token conversion functions. Its representation impacts how conversion/copy operations occur; needed to reason about pointer/length correctness.\n\nNotes:\n- The intent is to provide the immediate callee (OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread), all of its listed callees, and the small set of type definitions used to interpret argument/field layouts. The bodies of these functions and the definitions of the listed types (including any global buffers/objects they reference) are needed to determine whether any of the standard string.h functions are called and, if so, whether those calls can access memory beyond the bounds of their pointer parameters.\n- If any of the above functions reference further helper functions or global buffers/structures that perform memory/string operations, include those additional symbols as well during the next-step analysis."
