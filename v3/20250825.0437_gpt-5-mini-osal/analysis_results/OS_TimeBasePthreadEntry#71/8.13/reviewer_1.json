Therefore the pointer could and should be declared const void *arg. As written the code accepts a non-const pointer and may require discarding a const qualifier elsewhere (assignment into a non-const union member), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry is a pthread start routine and must match the pthread_create prototype (void *(*)(void *)), so the parameter type cannot be changed to const void * without violating the required external API. MISRA Rule 8.13\u2019s recommendation to use const-qualified pointer targets where possible does not mandate changing the signature of a required callback/override whose prototype is fixed by an external API. In other words, the API constraint prevents making the parameter const here, so the reported violation is not applicable. (If you control the wrapper/union types and callers, you could consider using a const-qualified member there to better preserve constness, but that cannot be applied to the pthread entry signature itself.)"
