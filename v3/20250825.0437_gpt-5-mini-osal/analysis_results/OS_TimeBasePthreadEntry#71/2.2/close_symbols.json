  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to assess whether the target function contains dead code:\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (definition): The target writes to local_arg.opaque_arg and then reads local_arg.id. If these are union members (type-punning) or overlapping fields in a struct, the write may be the only way id becomes defined. You must inspect the exact definition (member types and layout) to determine whether the opaque_arg write is necessary for setting id or is truly unused (dead).\n\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (implementation / definition): The call is the only observable action in the target function. To decide if the preceding assignment is dead you must see how the callback uses the passed id (what side-effects depend on its value). If the callback performs observable actions based on id, the assignment is not dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectId_t (typedef used by OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t / callbacks): If local_arg.id is of type OS_ObjectId_t (or another specific integer type), you need its typedef/representation (size, value range) to reason about whether writing a pointer to opaque_arg can validly produce a meaningful id and whether removing the write changes behavior.\n\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskDelay_Impl, OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdEqual, OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFromToken: These are the callees of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (from the static call graph). They produce observable side-effects (task registration, object lookups/releases, delays, locking/unlocking) and their behavior may depend on the id value passed into the callback. To conclude that the assignment in the entry function is dead (i.e., removable without changing program behaviour) you must inspect these functions to see whether different id values (or an uninitialized id) change system state or timing."
