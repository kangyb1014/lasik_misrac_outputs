  "explanation": "To determine whether UtMem2BinFileCmp violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self\u2011calls you must examine every function it calls (and the functions those routines call) to see if any call path can return to UtMem2BinFileCmp. The following symbols are therefore required: \n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: This is the only callee listed in the provided static graph for the target; you must inspect its implementation/callees to ensure it does not (directly or via other functions) call back into UtMem2BinFileCmp. \n\n- UtAssert_True: Called in the error path of the target. Even if UtAssert_GetContext appears in the graph, UtAssert_True may call UtAssert_GetContext or other helpers; its implementation and callees must be checked for any path back to UtMem2BinFileCmp. \n\n- fopen, fgetc, fclose: Standard I/O calls used by the target. Their implementations (or platform/library call graphs) should be confirmed not to call into project code that could lead back to UtMem2BinFileCmp. \n\n- printf: Called by the target to report mismatches/errors; its implementation (or any project wrapper) must be checked to ensure it does not invoke callbacks or logging hooks that could call UtMem2BinFileCmp. \n\n- strerror and errno: errno is read and strerror is called; if strerror is implemented or wrapped in the project in a way that calls back into project functions (or if errno access implies runtime hooks), those paths must be examined. \n\nIn short: you need the bodies or call\u2011graphs of each direct callee of UtMem2BinFileCmp and the transitive callees of those routines (starting with the symbols listed) to prove there is no indirect path that returns to UtMem2BinFileCmp."
