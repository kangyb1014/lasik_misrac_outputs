  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and related macros/typedefs for use of compiler-specific language extensions. I did not find any explicit compiler extensions such as: __attribute__ or other __attribute__ variants, __builtin_* or __extension__ identifiers, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler (__asm__), labels-as-values (&&label), pragmas that are compiler-specific (e.g. #pragma GCC), or other vendor-specific keywords documented as extensions. The variadic macro (UtAssert_True using __VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature, and the typedefs using stdint types (uint8_t/uint32_t) are standard. The implicit conversion from void* to an object pointer (const uint8 *MemByte = Memory) is permitted in C (not a compiler extension). Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
