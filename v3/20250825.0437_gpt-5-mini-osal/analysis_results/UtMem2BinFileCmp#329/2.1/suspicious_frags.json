  "explanation": "The primary concern for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code) in this function is the use of the assertion call that is invoked with a constant false (UtAssert_True(false,...)). If UtAssert_True / UtAssertEx is implemented as a non-returning routine (for example, it terminates the program, longjmps, or is marked noreturn), then any code that follows that call on the same control path may become unreachable. Therefore the assertion call and the code that follows it (the printf immediately before it is executed only on the error path, but the assertion may prevent further execution) and the function return should be investigated to determine whether UtAssertEx is non-returning and whether that creates unreachable code. All other statements in the function (fopen handling, the fgetc loop body including the miscompare printf and break, fclose on the normal path, initialization of variables, etc.) are reachable under at least one valid execution path (e.g., success/failure of fopen, file length leading to loop iterations), so they do not appear to be candidates for unreachable-code violations and do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
