  "explanation": "To decide whether UtMem2BinFileCmp violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings you must resolve all external references and types the function relies on and also check for any use (direct or indirect) of memcmp:\n\n- fopen: needed to understand how the file is opened and whether failure path (and thus alternative flows) could cause a string comparison to be used instead.\n- fgetc: used for reading bytes from the file; understanding its return and EOF handling is necessary to determine the loop termination and whether the function is comparing file bytes or string terminators.\n- fclose: external I/O cleanup; required to fully understand control flow and resource handling.\n- FILE: type of the file handle; needed to resolve declarations and effects of fopen/fclose.\n- EOF: used as the loop sentinel from fgetc; necessary to reason about when comparison stops (not at a NUL byte unless file contains it).\n- printf: used to report miscompares or errors; included to verify that reporting does not hide any string-based comparison.\n- strerror: used in the error path; needed to understand error-reporting behavior and control flow when file open fails.\n- errno: used with strerror; required to resolve the error-handling path semantics.\n- UtAssert_True: external test-assert function called on error; needed to resolve whether assertions invoke any string-comparison helpers or alter control flow relevant to the rule.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: present in the static call graph as a related UtAssert symbol; include to allow investigation of UtAssert_True implementation if needed (to rule out indirect memcmp use inside error handling/asserts).\n- uint8: typedef of MemByte element type; required to determine whether Memory is treated as raw bytes or a character/string type.\n- uint32: typedef of index i; needed for reasoning about index range and whether signed/unsigned issues could make the function treat data as strings.\n- bool: return type of the function; needed to resolve assertions about return values in relation to the MISRA rule.\n- memcmp: the symbol the MISRA rule addresses \u2014 include it so the analyzer can confirm there is no direct or indirect call to memcmp (or macros wrapping it) in this function or in any invoked helpers.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst (or tool) resolve external calls, types and control-flow to determine definitively whether the function uses memcmp on null-terminated strings (it does not appear to do so from the local code, but memcmp and UtAssert-related symbols must be checked to exclude indirect usage)."
