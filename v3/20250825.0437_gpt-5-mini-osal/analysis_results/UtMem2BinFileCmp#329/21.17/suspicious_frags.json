  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 applies to use of functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that take pointer parameters and could access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. The provided function does not call any of these <string.h> functions. The only potential <string.h>-related function present is strerror(), but strerror does not take a pointer to a caller-supplied buffer (it takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal/static message), so it is not in the scope of Rule 21.17 as an operation that could access beyond the bounds of a caller-supplied object. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: Although not relevant to Rule 21.17, the loop indexes MemByte[i] without any information about the size of the memory block referenced by Memory, which could be an out-of-bounds access under other MISRA rules. That issue is not flagged here because it does not involve functions from <string.h> covered by Rule 21.17."
