  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the evidence shown. While OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext only passes iter->arg to the match callback and the iterator code does not write through arg, that by itself is not sufficient to conclude the pointer can be made const. The arg member is part of the iterator API (OS_object_iter_t) and is passed to a callback of type OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t; the callback signature determines whether the argument must be non-const. If the match function type expects a void * (i.e. may legally modify what it points to), changing iter->arg to const void * would be an incompatible API change and could break code that relies on mutable access. There is no definition shown of OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t or the call sites that populate iter->arg (e.g. OS_ObjectIdIterateActive), so you cannot prove that arg is always used only as a read-only input across the whole codebase. Therefore the report that this code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is not correct based on the provided snippets. If, after inspecting the callback typedef and all call sites, it is proven that neither the callback nor any other code ever modifies the pointee, then converting arg (and the callback parameter) to point to const could satisfy Rule 8.13 \u2014 but that proof is not present here."
