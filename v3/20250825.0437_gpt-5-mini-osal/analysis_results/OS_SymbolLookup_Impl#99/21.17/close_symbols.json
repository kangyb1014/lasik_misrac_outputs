  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C string/bounds rules you must inspect any function that might call or manipulate C string-handling routines on SymbolName or related buffers, plus the iterator/type definitions that supply data to those functions. Reasons: \n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Primary global symbol lookup called directly with SymbolName. Must inspect its implementation for use of memcpy/strcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc and how it bounds/checks SymbolName and any destination buffers (including SymbolAddress handling if buffers are involved).\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Called for each module when global lookup fails; likely performs symbol-name comparisons/copies or constructs strings for module-local lookups. Its code must be checked for any string.h usage and buffer-size handling.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; it may derive names or indices from the token or perform string operations that affect bounds \u2014 include to follow string usage inside module lookup.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Initializes the iterator used to walk modules. Understanding how the iterator is set up can reveal whether iterator state/fields (including any name buffers) are valid and whether any string data is produced/owned by the iterator.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: Callee of IterateActive \u2014 include to confirm how the iterator and its internal buffers are initialized (sizes, ownership) which can affect downstream string operations.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext: Used in the loop to obtain the next iterator token and is the immediate source of the iter.token passed to OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. Must inspect it for any string operations or for whether it populates buffers handed to module lookup.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Called after iteration; include to ensure there are no buffered accesses or deferred string operations affecting lifetime; also to inspect cleanup semantics if relevant to buffer ownership.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: Callee of Destroy \u2014 include to follow through any allocator/string cleanup that might affect lifetime or bounds assumptions.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (and its token member): The type/layout of iter and iter.token is directly passed to module lookup. You must know the size, fields and ownership semantics to determine whether any string buffer pointers derived from it can cause out-of-bounds accesses when used by module or generic lookup routines.\n\n- OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE: The handle passed to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl can affect which symbol table/path is used; different backends may use different string operations or buffer semantics, so include to determine which implementation/path to inspect.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Needed to understand control flow (when lookup stops) \u2014 relevant to whether subsequent code paths that might do string operations are executed.\n\nInclude the source/implementations of the listed symbols (and any further callees they invoke that actually call string.h routines) when analyzing MISRA C rule compliance."
