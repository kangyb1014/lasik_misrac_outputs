  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (function parameters shall not be modified \u2014 the pointer object may be changed but the pointer variable itself shall not), we must ensure that none of the called symbols are implemented as macros/inline code that could directly assign to the parameter identifiers (SymbolAddress or SymbolName) in the caller. Specifically:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee that receives SymbolAddress and SymbolName. Its definition is required to check whether it is a plain function or a macro/inline that might expand to assignments using these identifier names (which would modify the caller's parameters if implemented as a macro).\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee that also receives SymbolAddress and SymbolName. It must be inspected for macro/inline implementations or other constructs that could modify the caller's parameter variables. It also calls OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, so its body may be relevant.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Called with &iter; this may be a macro that expands into iterator initialization code. Its definition is needed to ensure the macro does not (directly or indirectly via expansion) contain assignments to SymbolAddress or SymbolName (for example, by referencing those identifiers mistakenly).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext: Used in the while loop condition; its implementation (or macro expansion) must be checked to ensure it does not perform assignments to the target function parameters.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Called at the end; if it is a macro/inline it could expand to code that assigns to variables in the caller scope. Its definition is needed to rule out modification of SymbolAddress or SymbolName.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIterateActive (per the call graph). Include to inspect any indirect macro/inline expansions that OS_ObjectIdIterateActive may expand into, which could modify caller-scope identifiers.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy. Included for the same reason as Init: to catch indirect macro/inline expansions that could modify the caller's parameters.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. Included because OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl may be implemented in terms of this and could indirectly cause macro-style modifications.\n\nIn short, obtain the definitions (or macro expansions) of these symbols so the next analyzer can confirm none of them expand into code that assigns to the parameter identifiers SymbolAddress or SymbolName in the scope of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
