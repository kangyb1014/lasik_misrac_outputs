  "explanation": "- uint8 (typedef): Needed to know the underlying type and whether the typedef itself includes const qualification (e.g. typedef unsigned char uint8; vs typedef const unsigned char uint8;). MISRA's pointer-to-const check depends on whether the pointed-to type is const-qualified, so the exact typedef is required.  \n- uint32 (typedef): Needed to verify the integer type used for the loop index; while it does not itself change pointer constness, its definition may reveal unusual typedefs/macros that could affect interpretation of the function signature and MISRA analysis.  \n- bool (typedef or <stdbool.h>): Needed to know whether bool is a true boolean type (e.g. _Bool via <stdbool.h> or a typedef) and to ensure no hidden const/qualifier surprises in the function signature.  \nNote: the function parameter Memory is declared as const void * in the target code; verifying the typedefs above ensures no hidden const is lost or introduced by those type definitions and allows correct application of the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
