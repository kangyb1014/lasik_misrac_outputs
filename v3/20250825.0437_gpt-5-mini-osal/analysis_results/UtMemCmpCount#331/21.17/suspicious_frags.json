  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the provided code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which targets those library functions) is not applicable. The function performs direct byte-indexing through a const uint8* pointer and bounds the accesses by the Length loop limit (i from 0 to Length-1). There are no calls that could cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects via string.h functions. Note: correctness with respect to actual buffer bounds depends on the caller supplying a Memory pointer that refers to at least Length bytes; that potential caller-side issue is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and thus not flagged here."
