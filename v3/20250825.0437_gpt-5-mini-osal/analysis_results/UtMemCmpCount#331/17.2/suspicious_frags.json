  "explanation": "No recursive calls are present. The function body contains only local variable declarations, a pointer assignment (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory), a for loop, an array-index comparison (Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF)), and direct returns; there are no function calls (direct or via function pointers), no macro expansions invoking functions, and no indirect call mechanisms. Therefore there are no fragments that could violate Rule 17.2 (functions calling themselves directly or indirectly)."
