  "explanation": "- uint32: needed to know the width and signedness of i and Length (unsigned 32-bit or otherwise). The determination whether the loop condition i < Length can be invariant depends on unsigned arithmetic/wrap\u2011around and the maximum representable value for uint32.\n- uint8: needed to know the size and representation of the bytes accessed via Byte_ptr[i] so any aliasing/qualification (e.g. volatile) or width issues affecting side\u2011effects can be assessed.\n- bool: needed to know the actual boolean type used for the return value (macro vs _Bool) and whether conversions in conditional contexts affect the controlling expression analysis.\n- Length (function parameter): the loop controlling expression is i < Length; to decide if that expression can be invariant you must know whether Length is a compile\u2011time constant, its provenance, and any attributes (e.g. volatile, const) that would affect whether the expression can legally change during loop execution.\n- Memory (function parameter: const void *): the pointer value and the object it points to (including qualifiers like volatile) determine whether reads Byte_ptr[i] have side effects that could indirectly affect the controlling expression or its evaluation (for example, if reads modify hardware state that changes Length externally).\n- Byte_ptr (local pointer): although local, its target object\u2019s qualifiers and aliasing behaviour are needed to rule out side effects from the array access that could change the controlling expression (e.g. if aliased to memory-mapped registers that affect Length).\n\nThese symbols (the typedefs and the parameter/pointed\u2011object attributes) are the minimal items required to judge whether the controlling expression i < Length is truly variant across iterations or could be invariant (or lead to an infinite loop) under project-specific type/qualification definitions."
