  "explanation": "There are no controlling expressions in the provided function to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 would apply. The function contains an assignment to a union member, a function call (OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id)), and a return statement; none of these are controlling expressions (i.e., they are not the conditions of if, switch, while, for, or do-while). There are also no loops or conditional statements (no while/for/do-while/if/switch) and thus no invariant controlling expressions to flag. The cppcheck comment and the remark that OS_TaskEntryPoint never returns do not introduce a controlling expression. Therefore no fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
