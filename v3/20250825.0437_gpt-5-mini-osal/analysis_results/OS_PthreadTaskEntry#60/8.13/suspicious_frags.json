  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: \n- The declaration of the local variable (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;) is not itself a pointer declaration requiring const qualification.\n- The call OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id); passes an integer/ID (not a pointer) so Rule 8.13 is not applicable there.\n- The return statement (return NULL;) only returns a null pointer constant; it does not declare or use a non-const pointer type that could be const-qualified.\n- The comment line is a suppression and not relevant to pointer const-qualification.\nNote: the two reported fragments are the only places in this function where pointer types are declared or assigned and thus are the relevant locations to check for possible const qualification (including consideration of the pthread API signature constraints)."
