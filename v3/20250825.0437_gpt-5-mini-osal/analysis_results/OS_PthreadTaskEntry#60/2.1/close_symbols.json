  "explanation": "- OS_TaskEntryPoint: The target calls OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id) and the comment states it \"Never returns\". To decide if the subsequent 'return NULL;' is unreachable, you must inspect OS_TaskEntryPoint\u2019s prototype and implementation (including any noreturn/_Noreturn/__attribute__((noreturn)) annotations) to determine whether it can actually return.\n- OS_TaskExit: The static call graph shows OS_TaskEntryPoint calls OS_TaskExit. If OS_TaskExit performs a non-returning action (for example, calls pthread_exit or otherwise terminates the thread), that makes OS_TaskEntryPoint non-returning. You must inspect OS_TaskExit\u2019s implementation and attributes to determine its control\u2011flow behavior.\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target reads local_arg.id (after storing arg into local_arg.opaque_arg). You need the union/struct definition to confirm that reading the id member here is well-defined and does not depend on unreachable code paths (and to ensure no implicit control flow or undefined behavior that could affect reachability reasoning).\n- pthread_exit: Common implementations of thread termination use pthread_exit (or equivalent) which does not return to the caller. If OS_TaskExit or OS_TaskEntryPoint calls pthread_exit, that proves non-return. Inspecting pthread_exit\u2019s documented non-return behavior (or any other underlying thread-termination routine it calls) is required to conclude that the return statement is unreachable."
