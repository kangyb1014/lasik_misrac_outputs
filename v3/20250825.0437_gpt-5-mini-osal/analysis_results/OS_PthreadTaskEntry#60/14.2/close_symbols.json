The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_TaskEntryPoint: The target directly calls this function. To determine MISRA compliance for for\u2011loops we must inspect its body for any for statements and check the three clauses (initialiser, condition, iteration) and whether functions called in those clauses or in the for\u2011body modify loop counters or flags. We also need its prototype/definition to know parameters and whether it ever returns (affects control flow).\n\nOS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit: These are the direct callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint (per the static call graph). Any for\u2011loops inside them (or their use of global/state) could violate the rule, and they may modify objects that serve as loop counters or loop control flags used in upstream for statements. Their definitions are required to examine local loop counters, flags, and side effects of function calls inside their for bodies.\n\nOS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target builds a local_arg and passes local_arg.id to OS_TaskEntryPoint. We must know the type and layout of this wrapper and the type of member id (integer type?) to confirm whether passing it could alias or otherwise affect loop counters or flags in called code, and to ensure no hidden modification of objects used as loop counters.\n\n(transitive) functions called by OS_TaskEntryPoint/OS_TaskPrepare/OS_TaskExit: The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of a for\u2011loop body. Any functions they call may modify loop counters or global flags; their bodies must be inspected. Include all transitive callees.\n\n(transitive) global objects referenced by OS_TaskEntryPoint/OS_TaskPrepare/OS_TaskExit: For the rule we must know which objects are used as loop counters or loop control flags and whether they are modified in loop bodies (including via called functions). Any globals these functions read or write need to be examined for side effects relevant to for\u2011loop formation."
