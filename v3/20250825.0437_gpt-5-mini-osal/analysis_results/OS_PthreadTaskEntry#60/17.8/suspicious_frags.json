  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter itself (the pointer variable), though modifying the object pointed to is permitted. In the provided code the parameter is declared as void *arg and is only read: it is copied into local_arg.opaque_arg (local copy) and never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or otherwise modified. There is no dereference that writes through arg (no *arg = ...), no arg = ... assignment, and no use of ++/-- on arg. The call OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id) uses a value derived from the local union, not a modification of the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
