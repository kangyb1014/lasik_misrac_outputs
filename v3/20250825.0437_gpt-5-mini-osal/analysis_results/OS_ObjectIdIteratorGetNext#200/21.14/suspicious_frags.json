  "explanation": "No use of the C standard library string functions (including memcmp) is present in the provided code. The function only performs integer/pointer operations and checks: increments iter->token.obj_idx, numeric comparison (>= iter->limit), null-pointer check (iter->match == NULL), and assigns iter->token.obj_id from record->active_id. There are no char pointers, string literals, or calls to memcmp/strcmp/strncmp/strcasecmp/etc. The iter->match callback could potentially perform string comparisons, but its implementation is outside the provided code and therefore not part of this fragment. Consequently, there are no occurrences in this fragment that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
