  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided code and related definitions for constructs that would be compiler-specific language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __attribute__((...)), __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, asm, nonstandard keywords, vendor-specific storage-class specifiers, named address-space qualifiers, or other documented compiler extensions). None of those appear in the code. The items that could be mistaken for extensions are standard C features: - ((osal_id_t){0}) is a C99 compound literal (standard, not a compiler extension). - static inline is the standard inline usage. - bool and stdbool-style usage is standard C99. - The macros (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED) and the inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are plain preprocessor and inline function constructs, not compiler extensions. - The forward declaration typedef and pointer/array indexing are standard C. Therefore there are no occurrences of documented compiler-specific language extensions in the provided fragments, so nothing needs to be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 investigation."
