  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not flagged because they are structural or clearly required for correct behaviour: the function signature and local declarations (OS_common_record_t *record; bool got_next;) are necessary to hold state; the return statement (return got_next;) is the observable outcome; and the overall loop/control-flow constructs are used to implement iteration over the object table. The provided helper definitions (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED) are straightforward and used by the flagged fragments (index computation, table access, and the undefined id value). The listed suspicious fragments cover assignments, the table access, the conditional match call, and the loop body \u2014 these are the operations that could potentially be unnecessary (dead) depending on how the iterator and match function are used and should be investigated. No other lines perform executed operations that look removable without changing program behaviour."
