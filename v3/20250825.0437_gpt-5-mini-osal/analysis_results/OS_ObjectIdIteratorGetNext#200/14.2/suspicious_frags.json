First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements (their three clauses and the loop counter/loop-control flag usage). The code uses a do..while loop with an explicit increment (++iter->token.obj_idx) and a boolean control (got_next) \u2014 these are not for statements, so they are not subject to Rule 14.2. \n\nFor completeness, the following constructs were reviewed and are not reported because they do not trigger Rule 14.2: \n- The do { ... } while (!got_next); loop \u2014 not a for statement. \n- The increment ++iter->token.obj_idx inside the loop body \u2014 while it acts as a loop counter, it is not part of a for-statement\u2019s clauses. \n- The call iter->match(iter->arg, &iter->token, record) inside the loop body \u2014 Rule 14.2\u2019s requirements about side effects refer to the second clause of a for statement, which is not present here. \n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 in this code."
