  ],
  "explanation": "Only the two return sites are flagged because Rule 2.1 concerns unreachable control-flow targets. The if/return fragment is suspicious because the failure branch may be impossible (for example if OS_NetworkGetID_Impl can never return a non-OS_SUCCESS value, or if OS_SUCCESS is defined such that the condition can never be true), which would make the return -1 unreachable; conversely, the final `return IdBuf;` is suspicious because if the low-level API always fails (or if OS_NetworkGetID_Impl contains an internal unconditional return or never returns), that final return could be unreachable. Other parts of the function (the function signature, the local declaration `int32 IdBuf;`, the comment lines, and the call expression as part of the if condition) are not intrinsically unreachable and do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 in this fragment. Investigation should focus on the behavior/definitions of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl and OS_SUCCESS (and any macro expansions) to determine actual reachability of the flagged returns."
