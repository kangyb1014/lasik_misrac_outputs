  "explanation": "To decide whether either branch in OS_UsecToTimespec is unreachable you must know what values the parameter 'usecs' can take at every call site and the types involved.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl: This is the direct caller listed in the call graph. You need its full implementation to see how the argument passed as 'usecs' is computed (range, constants used, guards) and whether it can ever be >= 1000000 or < 1000000. If OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl always passes a value in one subrange, one branch in OS_UsecToTimespec could be unreachable.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseSet: This is a caller of OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl (per the call graph). Inspecting it may be necessary to trace values/constraints further upstream (to determine whether OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl itself can receive varying inputs or only fixed/limited ones).\n\n- uint32 (typedef): You must know the exact typedef (width and signedness) of uint32 to correctly reason about the comparison and arithmetic semantics (promotion rules, overflow/underflow, modulo behavior). The signedness/width can affect whether the condition usecs < 1000000 can be statically proven true/false.\n\n- struct timespec (definition): Knowing the types of tv_sec and tv_nsec (and any related range guarantees) is useful to reason about whether assignments are well-formed or if some paths are impossible due to type constraints; it also helps detect if additional implicit conversions could affect reachability reasoning.\n\n- Any constants/macros used by OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl to compute the usecs argument: If OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl uses other macros/constants (conversion factors, limits, compile-time configuration) to produce the 'usecs' value, those symbols are required to see whether the produced value can span both branches or is constrained to a single branch.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows a proof (static or manual) about the possible values of 'usecs' at the call site(s) and thus whether either branch of the if/else is unreachable (violating MISRA's unreachable-code rule)."
