  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the supplied snippets. Each conditional and statement can be reached depending on runtime data and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1:\n\n- OS_UsecToTimespec: The if (usecs < 1000000) / else branches are reachable because usecs is a runtime uint32 value and can be either less than or greater-or-equal to 1,000,000.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl: The outer if (local->assigned_signal != 0) is dependent on the runtime state of local->assigned_signal and therefore both the body and the path skipping it are reachable. Within the body, the error branch (status < 0) of timer_settime and the success branch (status >= 0) are runtime-dependent and both reachable. The nested interval_time > 0 / else branches are also reachable since interval_time is a runtime parameter.\n\n- OS_TimeBaseSet: The ARGCHECK constraints do not make any code unreachable; they only validate inputs at runtime. The objtype check (disallowing calls from a timer callback), the OS_ObjectIdGetById failure/success paths, and the subsequent lock/set/unlock/release paths are all runtime-dependent and reachable.\n\nBecause all branches and statements depend on runtime inputs or external state (function return values, object fields, function parameters), there is no statically unreachable code in the provided fragments that would require investigation for Rule 2.1."
