  "explanation": "No pointer in the function can reasonably be const-qualified for the pointed-to type. The only pointer parameter is \"struct timespec *time_spec\", and the function explicitly writes to *time_spec (assigns to tv_sec and tv_nsec), so it must point to a non-const object \u2014 making the pointed-to type const would prevent the required writes. There are no other pointer variables or pointer usages in the provided code (usecs is an integer by value). Therefore Rule 8.13 does not flag any fragment here. (Note: making the pointer itself const, e.g. \"struct timespec * const time_spec\", would prevent reassigning the pointer but does not address Rule 8.13, which concerns const qualification of the pointed-to type.)"
