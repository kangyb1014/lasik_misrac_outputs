  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning: the rule prohibits modifying a function parameter itself (and specifically prohibits assigning to a pointer parameter), while permitting modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter. In OS_UsecToTimespec the integer parameter usecs is only read (never assigned or incremented), and the pointer parameter time_spec is not reassigned \u2014 only the fields of the object it points to (time_spec->tv_sec and time_spec->tv_nsec) are written, which is allowed by the rule. There are no statements that modify the pointer variable time_spec itself (no assignments, pointer arithmetic, or reinitialization), so no code fragments need investigation under Rule 17.8."
