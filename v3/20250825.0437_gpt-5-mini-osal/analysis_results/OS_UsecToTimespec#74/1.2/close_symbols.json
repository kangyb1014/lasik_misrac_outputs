  "explanation": "You must inspect the exact typedef/definitions that back the identifiers used in the function to determine whether any compiler language extensions are being used. Specifically:\n\n- typedef uint32: The name uint32 is not a standard C keyword; it is a typedef (or macro) supplied by a header. That typedef might expand to a plain unsigned type (standard) or to a compiler-specific extended type or use compiler attributes (for example __attribute__, __int128, __mode__, or __extension__). To decide if the function uses language extensions you must see the typedef's definition.\n\n- struct timespec (complete definition): timespec is usually provided by <time.h> but its exact definition in the build environment must be checked. Its member types (tv_sec, tv_nsec) or the struct itself might carry implementation-specific types or attributes (time_t variants, __attribute__ annotations, non\u2011standard suffixes). These would constitute language extensions if present.\n\n- Header(s)/macros that define/affect those types: The headers that introduce uint32 and struct timespec (and any macros they use) must be examined for compiler-specific macros or attributes. Some projects wrap typedefs or struct members with macros that expand to compiler extensions; you must inspect those macros (e.g., any use of __attribute__, __extension__, __packed__, __int64, compiler builtins) to determine MISRA rule compliance.\n\nNo other symbols from the call graph are needed: the function body itself uses only these types and standard operators/integers, so verifying the underlying typedefs/structs and any macros they rely on is sufficient to detect language extensions."
