  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. That rule concerns use of the string-handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided function OS_UsecToTimespec contains only integer arithmetic and direct assignments to members of struct timespec via the time_spec pointer; it does not call or reference any <string.h> functions (nor perform any buffer/string copying). Therefore there are no fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate. (Note: other potential concerns such as integer overflow or tv_nsec range are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
