  "explanation": "- OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl: This is the direct caller that invokes OS_UsecToTimespec. You must inspect its callsite to see what value/expression is passed as the usecs argument (if it is a compile-time constant, const-qualified, or otherwise invariant). The controlling expression (usecs < 1000000) can only be judged non-invariant by examining the actual argument at the callsite.\n- OS_TimeBaseSet: This is a caller of OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl. If OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl simply forwards a parameter from higher-level callers, the invariance of the controlling expression could originate there; tracing the value back may be necessary to determine whether it can be non\u2011varying.\n- argument expression passed to OS_UsecToTimespec in OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl: Name and form of the exact expression/variable used at the call (e.g., literal, const variable, enum, macro, or runtime value). Determining whether the if-condition is invariant requires knowing whether this exact argument can vary at run time.\n- uint32 (typedef): The actual typedef definition may include qualifiers or be an alias for another type (e.g., const, volatile, or an enum) that affect whether the parameter is effectively invariant. Confirming the underlying type/qualifiers is needed for the MISRA check.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: This function is called by OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl and might produce or influence the value(s) used to compute the usecs argument. If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (or other callees) determine or constrain the argument to a fixed value, that would make the controlling expression invariant."
