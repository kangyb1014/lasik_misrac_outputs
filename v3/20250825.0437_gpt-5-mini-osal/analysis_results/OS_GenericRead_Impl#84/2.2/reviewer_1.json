  "explanation": "The report is correct. With OS_DEBUG defined as an empty macro (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)), the statement\n\n    OS_DEBUG(\"read: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n\npreprocesses to just a semicolon (a null statement). That null statement is an operation that will be executed at runtime but has no effect; removing it would not change program behaviour. By the MISRA C 2023 definition cited (\"Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\"), this is dead code and therefore violates Rule 2.2. (Note: the original logging call and its side\u2011effects are not present because the macro expansion removes the call and its argument evaluation.)"
