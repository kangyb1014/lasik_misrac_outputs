  "explanation": "The function parameters are FuncKey, LocalBuffer (const void *), and MaxSize. There are no assignments, increments, or other modifications to these parameter variables in the function body \u2014 they are only read or passed to other functions. LocalBuffer is used as the source argument to memcpy (a read-only use consistent with its const qualifier), and the code modifies the buffer referred to by StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr (not any pointer parameter). Therefore no fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (the pointer parameter itself is not modified, and the object referred to by the pointer parameter is not written via LocalBuffer)."
