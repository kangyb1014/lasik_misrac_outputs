Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To check MISRA 'for loop shall be well\u2011formed' for this function you must be able to determine whether any for\u2011loop semantics or side\u2011effects are introduced by the identifiers or calls present in the function (including any macros or called functions, since the behaviour of a for\u2011loop body includes called functions). The reason each symbol is required: \n\n- OS_GetMaxForObjectType: This is called in the assignment to iter->limit. It may be a macro or inline function; its definition is required to see if it contains any for loops or persistent side effects that could affect loop counters or objects used in a for statement that might be introduced when this function is inlined or expanded.\n\n- OS_GetBaseForObjectType: This is called in the assignment to iter->base and may be a macro/inline function. Its body could contain loops or modify globals; the definition is needed to ensure no for\u2011loops or side effects that would violate the rule are present or introduced into the caller via expansion.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit: This function is called and its implementation is required because if it contains for loops, or if it modifies objects that might serve as loop counters/flags in a surrounding for loop, that could affect well\u2011formedness. Also it could be a macro/inline with side effects.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (definition): The function writes to members of iter (match, arg, limit, base, token). Knowing the exact typedef/structure (types of these members) is necessary to determine whether writes could alias or modify objects used as loop counters/flags elsewhere, and to identify the token member type passed into OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit.\n\n- OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t (typedef): The type of match is stored in iter->match. If this typedef is a macro or has special calling semantics that could modify external objects used as loop counters, that must be known. Also needed to fully understand the iterator state that may be referenced in loops.\n\n- osal_objtype_t (typedef/enum): The objtype parameter is passed to the GetBase/GetMax functions and to OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit; its definition can affect how those functions behave (e.g. branching or table lookups) and whether any side effects or loops are introduced based on objtype.\n\n- OS_common_table (declaration and element type): iter->base is set to &OS_common_table[OS_GetBaseForObjectType(objtype)]. The declaration and element type are needed to see if indexing or pointer arithmetic is implemented via macros or if the element type has side effects, and to determine aliasing with other objects that might be used as loop counters/flags.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL (macro/enum constant): Passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit; if this is a macro that expands to an expression with side effects (unlikely but possible), its definition is needed to show whether it could violate the rule when used in a for loop context.\n\nIn summary: obtain the full definitions/implementations (or macro expansions) of the three callees and the complete type declarations for the iterator, its members, the object type enum, and the common table so the next agent can inspect any for loops or side effects that would affect the MISRA for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness analysis."
