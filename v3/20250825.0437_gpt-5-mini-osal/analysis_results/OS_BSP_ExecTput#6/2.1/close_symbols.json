  "explanation": "- fork: Needed to determine which branch (child vs parent) executes each statement. Reachability of code depends on fork() return values (negative/error, zero=child, positive=parent).\\n- execlp: Crucial because its semantics (execve-family) determine reachability: on successful exec it replaces the process image and does not return, so any statements after execlp in the child are not executed; on failure execlp returns (typically -1). The analysis must use execlp behavior to decide if code following it is unreachable.\\n- exit: Child calls exit(EXIT_FAILURE) after execlp; exit() terminates the process and does not return, which affects reachability of any subsequent code in that process.\\n- waitpid: In the parent, waitpid controls whether parent-side statements after fork are reachable and whether the function can continue; include to reason about parent-side control flow.\\n- EXIT_FAILURE: The macro passed to exit affects the semantics of the exit call (termination) and should be known for completeness in control-flow reasoning.\\n- NULL: Used as the terminator argument to execlp; knowing its use ensures correct interpretation of the execlp call site.\\n- pid_t: Type of cpid; knowing its definition and signedness can be relevant to reasoning about fork() return-value tests (cpid < 0, cpid == 0)."
