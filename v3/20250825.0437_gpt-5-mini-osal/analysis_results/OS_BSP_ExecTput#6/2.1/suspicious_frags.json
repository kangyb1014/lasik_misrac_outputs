    "if (cpid == 0)\n    {\n        execlp(\"tput\", \"tput\", cap, param, NULL);\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }",

  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not present unreachable-code concerns and therefore do not need investigation: the function signature and local variable declarations (pid_t cpid; int status;) are ordinary. The assignment cpid = fork(); is an ordinary system call whose result is subsequently checked; the checks for cpid < 0 and cpid == 0 are conditional branches (not statically unreachable). The code following the child branch (e.g., the parent path) is reachable when fork() returns a positive PID. The lines not listed above are simple control-flow constructs or declarations that are reachable in some execution paths and do not by themselves indicate unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
