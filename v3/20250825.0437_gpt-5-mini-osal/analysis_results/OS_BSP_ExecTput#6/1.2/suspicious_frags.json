  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment uses standard C features (static function, return, if, comparisons, calls) and POSIX library/system calls (fork, execlp, waitpid, pid_t, exit, EXIT_FAILURE). POSIX APIs are platform/system interfaces, not compiler language extensions. There are no GCC/Clang-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, asm(...), typeof, statement expressions ({: ... :}), nested functions, __builtin_* identifiers, or pragma/extension directives that compilers document as language extensions. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
