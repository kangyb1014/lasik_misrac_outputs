  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The two parameters are declared as const char *cap and const char *param and there are no assignments to cap or param (no reassignments, increments, or passes by non-const reference that would modify the pointer itself). Passing cap and param to execlp does not modify the parameter variables in this function; execlp is called in the child process after fork and does not change the pointers in the parent. All other operations (fork, exit, waitpid) affect local variables or process state, not the function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
