  "explanation": "execlp: need the prototype/signature to confirm how the cap and param arguments are passed (value vs pointer-to-pointer) and whether execlp could legally accept const char * or would require discarding const \u2014 this shows callees do not modify the caller's pointer variables (they receive copies). fork: prototype clarifies return type and semantics (returns pid_t in the caller) and ensures no pointer-to-pointer or parameter modification is involved. waitpid: prototype shows how the status argument is passed and confirms it does not take or modify the function's cap/param pointers. exit: prototype ensures it does not modify any caller parameters and documents behavior on the child path. pid_t: type definition is needed to understand the cpid variable type and assignment semantics (ensures no hidden pointer/aliasing semantics). EXIT_FAILURE: macro/constant used in exit() call \u2014 include to fully understand control-flow/exit behavior. Together these symbols let an analyzer verify that cap and param (both declared const char *) are not reassigned within OS_BSP_ExecTput and that none of the called functions accept pointers to those pointer variables (i.e., no callee can modify the parameter variables themselves)."
