  "explanation": "1) execlp (declaration/prototype from the platform headers, e.g. <unistd.h>): The core question is whether passing cap and param (declared const char *) into execlp discards constness. You must inspect execlp's prototype (and how the variadic arguments are specified) to determine the expected argument types and whether a const->non-const conversion occurs.  \n\n2) exec family specification/doc (notes that the variadic args to execlp are char * / need (char *)NULL): POSIX/implementation notes clarify that the variadic argument list for execlp is intended to be char * pointers and that the final NULL should be a (char *)NULL. This documentation shows the intended types for the varargs (and the need to cast NULL), which is essential to judge if passing const char * is a const-qualification discard (MISRA concern).  \n\n3) NULL macro definition (how NULL is defined on the target platform): The exec manpages often recommend terminating with (char *)NULL. The actual type of NULL on the platform (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0) affects whether the code is relying on implicit conversions in the variadic call; this helps determine if there is a hidden const-discard or a required cast.  \n\n4) OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl (function prototype/signature): This caller supplies the cap/param arguments to OS_BSP_ExecTput. To assess whether making parameters const (or whether cap/param were already non-const upstream) is possible or if any constness was lost earlier, you need the caller's prototype/signature (parameter types).  \n\n5) UT_BSP_DoText (function prototype/signature): This higher-level caller (from the static call graph) may be the origin of the string arguments. Its prototype shows whether arguments are const-qualified at the top-level API or if non-const pointers are being passed through the call chain, which affects the MISRA analysis of whether const qualification is possible/propagatable.\n\nNotes: Other symbols used in the function (fork, waitpid, exit, pid_t, EXIT_FAILURE) are not relevant to the const-qualification MISRA rule and thus are not required for this specific constness analysis."
