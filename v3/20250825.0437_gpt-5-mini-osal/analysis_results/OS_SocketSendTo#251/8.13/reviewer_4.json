Therefore the pointer could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (const OS_stream_internal_record_t *). The assignment via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET therefore results in a non-const pointer where a pointer-to-const would suffice, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever it is not used to modify the pointed-to object. In this function the local variable stream is only used for read access (checking stream->socket_type) and is never used to modify the OS_stream_internal_record_t. Therefore it could and should be declared as const OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream; assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (which presumably yields a non-const pointer) to a pointer-to-const is allowed and would satisfy Rule 8.13. If there is an API or other reason that requires stream to be a pointer-to-modifiable data elsewhere, that should be documented as a justified deviation; otherwise changing the declaration to a pointer-to-const is the appropriate fix."
