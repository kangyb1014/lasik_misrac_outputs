  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketSendTo:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketSendTo(osal_id_t sock_id, const void *buffer, size_t buflen, const OS_SockAddr_t *RemoteAddr)\n{\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    int32                        return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(buflen);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(RemoteAddr);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sock_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n\n        if (stream->socket_type != OS_SocketType_DATAGRAM)\n        {\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_TYPE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SocketSendTo_Impl(&token, buffer, buflen, RemoteAddr);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_CHECK_POINTER(RemoteAddr);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a macro invocation (OS_CHECK_POINTER(RemoteAddr);) and not a for statement. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies only to for loops, so it is not applicable here. (Only if the macro expanded into a malformed for loop would Rule 14.2 be relevant.)"
