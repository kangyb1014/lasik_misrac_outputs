  "explanation": "I examined all provided functions and could not find any statically unreachable code fragments. Reasoning by function:\n\n- OS_CountSemDelete: control flow branches on the result of OS_ObjectIdGetById; both the path taken when it returns success and the path when it returns an error are reachable at runtime depending on the called function's return value. There is no code after an unconditional return that would be dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: the early return when OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit fails is reachable; the subsequent code that executes when that call succeeds is reachable. The conditional block that calls OS_ObjectIdConvertToken is entered for the success case. The transaction-cancel call is guarded by a non-success check and is reachable if any of the intermediate steps fail.\n\n- OS_CountSemDelete_Impl: both branches (sem_destroy failure vs success) are reachable depending on the runtime return of sem_destroy; neither branch is syntactically dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: the two-way assignment of final_id is controlled by operation_status and both branches are reachable. The call to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish is unconditional and reachable. The subsequent OS_NotifyEvent call is guarded by operation_status == OS_SUCCESS and thus reachable when appropriate.\n\nNo unconditional jumps, code after unconditional returns, or obviously dead/never-taken branches appear in the supplied code. Note: certain branches could be effectively never taken in a particular runtime configuration if the invoked functions always return a particular status, but that is a runtime property of those functions (not statically evident here) and not a static unreachable-code violation in the snippets provided."
