  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments were found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rationale:\n\n- OS_CountSemDelete_Impl already takes a const OS_object_token_t * (const-qualified pointer), so it complies with the rule.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_object_token_t *token) must accept a non-const pointer because it initializes/writes into the token (it calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, sets token->obj_idx, token->obj_id, and may call OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel). Making this pointer const would be incorrect.\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token) must accept a non-const pointer because it calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id), which is expected to modify the token state (unlock/return the record to the pool). Thus it cannot be const-qualified.\n- The local token variable in OS_CountSemDelete is non-const because it is written by OS_ObjectIdGetById and subsequently passed to OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete which modifies it; therefore it cannot be declared const.\n- sem_destroy(&impl->id) takes a pointer to a semaphore object that sem_destroy modifies; the pointer cannot be const.\n\nGiven these facts, there are no pointer parameters in the provided code that could be safely changed to point-to-const without preventing required modifications. Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 8.13 based on the provided snippets."
