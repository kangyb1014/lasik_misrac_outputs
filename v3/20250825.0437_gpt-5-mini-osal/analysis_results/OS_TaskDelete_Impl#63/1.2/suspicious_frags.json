  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related definitions for uses of compiler/language extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang extensions such as typeof, __attribute__, asm, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), labels-as-values, zero-length arrays, nonstandard keywords, or other documented vendor extensions). None are present:\n\n- No use of GNU/clang-specific keywords or builtins (typeof, __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, etc.).\n- No nested functions or label-as-value constructs.\n- No statement-expressions ({ ... }) or other expression-level blocks.\n- The macros used (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_DEBUG) use standard C syntax; the variadic macro form is the C99-standard form, not a compiler-only extension.\n- Use of inline (static inline) is standard C (since C99) and the function prototypes/typedefs shown are standard C/POSIX constructs. pthread_* and strerror are POSIX library calls, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that use compiler language extensions that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
