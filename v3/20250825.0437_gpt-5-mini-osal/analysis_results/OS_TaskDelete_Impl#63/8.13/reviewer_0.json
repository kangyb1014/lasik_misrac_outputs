True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable 'impl' is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl) but in this function it is only used to read impl->id. Therefore it could and should be declared as a pointer to const (const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl). The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) yields a pointer to the table element (non-const), which can be implicitly converted to a pointer to const. Since no modification of *impl occurs here, not qualifying the pointer as pointing to const violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskDelete_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_task_internal_record_t OS_impl_task_table[OS_MAX_TASKS]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_t id;\n} OS_impl_task_internal_record_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\nstatic inline osal_id_t OS_ObjectIdFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_id;\n}\n...\nstatic inline unsigned long OS_ObjectIdToInteger(osal_id_t object_id)\n{\n#ifdef OSAL_OMIT_DEPRECATED\n    return object_id.v;\n#else\n    return object_id;\n#endif\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_TaskDelete_Impl the local variable impl is only used to read impl->id; there are no writes through impl. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET yields a pointer to a table element of type OS_impl_task_internal_record_t * (from a non-const array), and assigning that to a pointer-to-const (const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *) is allowed by C (implicit conversion from T * to const T *). Therefore the pointer should be declared to point to const to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A simple fix is to change the declaration to: const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;"
