  "scenario": "The fragment calls two inline accessor functions (OS_ObjectIdFromToken and OS_ObjectIdToInteger) and the OS_DEBUG macro/function to print a message. Neither of the inline accessors nor the debug macro, as shown, call OS_TaskDelete_Impl (no evidence of any call chain that would lead back to OS_TaskDelete_Impl). Therefore there is no direct or indirect self-call in this fragment. (A violation would occur only if OS_DEBUG or either accessor were implemented such that they called back into OS_TaskDelete_Impl, which is not the case here.)"
