  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for loops (clauses, loop counter, control flags and side-effects). The provided target function and the related symbols contain no for statements to evaluate: \n- OS_StatusToString has no for loop clauses or loop counters. It only performs a NULL check, a call to snprintf, and returns a pointer.\n- OS_StatusToInteger is a simple inline cast and contains no loops.\n- The typedefs shown are type definitions and contain no control-flow constructs.\n- There are no macros or other code fragments in the supplied snippets that expand to a for statement.\nTherefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 to report. Other constructs (snprintf use, pointer/array sizing with sizeof(*status_string), casting of status to long) may warrant review under other MISRA rules (e.g. library function usage, type conversions, pointer handling) but are not relevant to Rule 14.2 and thus are not included as suspicious fragments for this rule."
