  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The code does not assign to the parameters 'status' or 'status_string' (no statements like status = ... or status_string = ...). The call to snprintf writes into the object pointed to by status_string, which is permitted by the rule (pointer-referred object may be modified). The assignment string = *status_string only reads the value referred to by the pointer and stores it into a local variable; it does not modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
