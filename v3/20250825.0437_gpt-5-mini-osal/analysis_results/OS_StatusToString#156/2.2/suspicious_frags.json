  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not appear to be dead code and therefore do not need further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2: - Function signature (char *OS_StatusToString(osal_status_t status, os_status_string_t *status_string)) defines the API and is required. - The if (status_string != NULL) check is a necessary runtime guard to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer; removing it would change behavior when a NULL argument is passed. - The use of sizeof(*status_string) is a legitimate way to obtain the buffer size when os_status_string_t is an array type; it affects how many bytes are written by snprintf and thus affects observable behavior. - The final return statement (return string;) is required to deliver the function result; removing it would change behavior. - The code structure and braces are syntactically necessary and not removable without changing program behavior. These non-selected fragments therefore do not meet the definition of dead code and do not need investigation for Rule 2.2."
