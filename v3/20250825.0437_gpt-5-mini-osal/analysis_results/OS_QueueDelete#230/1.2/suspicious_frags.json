  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The function and related tokens use only standard C constructs: normal typedef-based integer types, plain function definition and calls, standard address-of operator (&token), integer constant macro (OS_SUCCESS), block comments, and a normal return statement. There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as identifiers or keywords with double underscores (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__), nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, labels-as-values, anonymous/unnamed structs/unions as an extension, inline assembly, or other documented compiler-specific constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
