  "explanation": "I inspected the provided functions (OS_QueueDelete, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_QueueDelete_Impl, and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete) and found no code that is statically unreachable. Specifically:\n\n- There are no constant conditions (e.g. if (0) or if (1) that makes a branch impossible) in the fragments shown. All conditionals depend on runtime-returned values (return_code, operation_status, mq_close result) and thus each branch can be taken in some execution scenario.\n- Early returns (e.g. return on OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit failure) are legitimate control-flow and do not create unreachable statements elsewhere in the function; the remaining code is reachable when the early-return condition is false.\n- There are no statements placed after an unconditional return in the same block that would be impossible to reach.\n- All uses of the token variable occur only after OS_ObjectIdGetById has returned success, so there is no path that uses an uninitialized token (given the shown logic).\n\nGiven the provided code and definitions, there are no fragments that can be identified as unreachable code under any possible execution, so nothing needs to be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 investigation based on the supplied snippets."
