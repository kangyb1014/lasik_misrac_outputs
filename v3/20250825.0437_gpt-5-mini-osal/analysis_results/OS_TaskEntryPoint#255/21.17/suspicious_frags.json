  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring they do not access out-of-bounds memory. The function OS_TaskEntryPoint contains no calls to any of these standard string handling functions. The only operations are: calling OS_TaskPrepare(task_id, &task_entry), checking the returned status, a NULL check and invocation of a function pointer (task_entry), and a call to OS_TaskExit(). None of these are string.h functions nor perform buffer/string operations in the shown code. The provided typedefs and the uint32 definition do not introduce string handling either. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.17. (If implementations of OS_TaskPrepare or OS_TaskExit elsewhere call string.h functions, those implementations would need review, but they are not present in the supplied code fragment and so are outside the requested scope.)"
