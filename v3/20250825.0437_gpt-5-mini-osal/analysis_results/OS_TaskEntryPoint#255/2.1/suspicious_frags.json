  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if (task_entry != NULL)\n    {\n        (*task_entry)();\n    }",
    "(*task_entry)();",
    "OS_TaskExit();"
  ],
  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function (the function signature, the local declaration of task_entry, the call and return-value test of OS_TaskPrepare, and the explanatory comment) do not exhibit typical forms of statically unreachable code (e.g. code following an unconditional return, infinite loop, or constant-false conditional). They are straightforward statements whose reachability depends on the documented behavior of external functions (OS_TaskPrepare and the task entry function); therefore they do not need separate investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 unless the contracts of those external functions indicate guaranteed non-return or guaranteed non-NULL, in which case the above listed fragments should be inspected."
