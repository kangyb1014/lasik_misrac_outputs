  "scenario": "The call (*task_entry)() is only executed when OS_TaskPrepare(task_id, &task_entry) == OS_SUCCESS and task_entry != NULL. As written, there is no guaranteed compile-time condition that prevents reaching this call, so it is not intrinsically unreachable. A concrete violation scenario would exist if OS_TaskPrepare is provably always failing or always sets task_entry to NULL (for example, if OS_TaskPrepare is a macro or an inline function that unconditionally returns OS_FAILURE or unconditionally assigns NULL to task_entry). In that case the call would be statically unreachable."
