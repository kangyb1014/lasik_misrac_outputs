  "explanation": "1) osal_task_entry: The typedef (including any attributes such as __attribute__((noreturn))) determines whether the task function pointer invoked by (*task_entry)() is declared to never return. If the pointed-to function is annotated noreturn, the call to (*task_entry)() would make the subsequent OS_TaskExit() call unreachable.  \n\n2) OS_TaskPrepare: Its implementation and documentation are needed to know all possible return paths and how it sets the out parameter task_entry. Specifically, whether OS_TaskPrepare can return OS_SUCCESS with task_entry == NULL or with a non-NULL task_entry, and whether it can itself terminate the thread or longjmp (i.e., any behavior that would affect reachability of later code). Without this, you cannot determine which branches are feasible and whether code after the call can be executed.  \n\n3) OS_SUCCESS: The exact definition/value (macro/enum) is required to interpret the comparison (OS_TaskPrepare(...) == OS_SUCCESS) and understand whether other return codes might be treated as success or if platform-specific overrides change semantics. This affects which branches are entered and thus reachability.  \n\n4) OS_TaskExit: The implementation and any annotations (e.g., noreturn) are required to know whether OS_TaskExit() ever returns to the caller. If OS_TaskExit is itself a non-returning termination routine, that does not create unreachable code here, but if it returns conditionally or is expected to be the normal cleanup path after a returning task, that influences whether earlier code paths could be considered unreachable.  \n\nCollecting these symbols (typedefs/attributes and the two callee implementations/semantics) provides the necessary information to determine if any statement in OS_TaskEntryPoint is provably unreachable and thus whether the MISRA C rule against unreachable code is violated."
