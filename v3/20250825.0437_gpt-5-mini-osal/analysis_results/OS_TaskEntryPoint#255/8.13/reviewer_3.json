Therefore it should be declared as a pointer to const (const OS_task_internal_record_t *task) or the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET accessor should return a pointer-to-const. As written, the code does not const-qualify the pointer even though it could, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskEntryPoint:\ntypedef osal_task((*osal_task_entry)(void))\n...\nstatic int32 OS_TaskPrepare(osal_id_t task_id, osal_task_entry *entrypt)\n{\n    int32                      return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t          token;\n    OS_task_internal_record_t *task;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, task_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        task = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_task_table, token);\n\n        return_code = OS_TaskMatch_Impl(&token);\n        *entrypt    = task->entry_function_pointer;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_TaskRegister_Impl(task_id);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Give event callback to the application */\n        return_code = OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_TASK_STARTUP, task_id, NULL);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        *entrypt = NULL;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not correct as stated. The code shown for OS_TaskEntryPoint does not contain a non-const data-pointer that is only used for read access \u2014 it declares a function-pointer variable (osal_task_entry) which is invoked; const-qualification of a function type/pointer is not applicable here. The scenario described by agent A actually refers to the local variable task in OS_TaskPrepare (OS_task_internal_record_t *task), which is only read (task->entry_function_pointer) and therefore could reasonably be declared as const OS_task_internal_record_t *task or the accessor could return a pointer-to-const. That would be the location relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. So the agent\u2019s report is incorrect about OS_TaskEntryPoint; however, the described const-qualification concern is valid for OS_TaskPrepare (subject to any project-specific reasons for keeping a non-const pointer)."
