  "explanation": "- OS_TaskPrepare: The target calls this function and uses its prototype/definition (and any macros that wrap it). Its declaration or inline definition could contain compiler-specific extensions (e.g., function attributes, inline asm, statement-expressions in wrapper macros, or nonstandard calling-convention attributes) that would constitute the language extensions MISRA rule forbids. Inspecting the implementation ensures no extensions are introduced into the same translation unit.\n- OS_TaskExit: The target calls this routine unconditionally at function end. Its prototype or definition could carry attributes (e.g., __attribute__((noreturn)), calling-convention attributes, inline asm) or be defined via macros/statement-expressions; these are relevant to decide if any language extensions are used in the same translation unit.\n- osal_task_entry: This typedef names the function-pointer type invoked by the target. The typedef may include nonstandard syntax or attributes (calling-convention attributes, GCC function types, or other extensions). You must inspect its definition to confirm the function-pointer type is expressed using standard C only.\n- osal_id_t: The task_id parameter type could be a typedef that uses compiler extensions (e.g., underlying type with attributes, packed/bitfield tricks, or exotic typedefs). Check its definition for extensions.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The target tests the return value against this macro/enum. The macro/enum definition could hide a language extension (for example a macro defined using a statement-expression or other compiler-specific construct). Verify it is a plain constant/enum.\n- NULL: The code compares task_entry to NULL. The NULL macro definition can vary; inspect it only if NULL is (re)defined in the same project headers to ensure it does not use compiler-specific constructs.\n\nThese symbols cover the function calls, the types, and macros used directly by OS_TaskEntryPoint whose declarations/definitions could introduce compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule. Inspecting their declarations/implementations in the relevant headers/translation units is sufficient to determine whether the target function uses any prohibited language extensions."
