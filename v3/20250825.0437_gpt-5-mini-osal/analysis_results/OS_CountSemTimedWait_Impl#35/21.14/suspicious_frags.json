  "explanation": "I inspected the target function OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl and all provided related code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using the standard-library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. None of the supplied code contains any call to memcmp, nor any other string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp) or manual bytewise comparisons that operate on C strings. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken index by an integer field (obj_idx) \u2014 no string operations. OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime manipulates struct timespec fields (tv_sec, tv_nsec) and does not use or compare strings. The semaphore call (sem_timedwait) and errno handling do not involve memcmp or string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided sources that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
