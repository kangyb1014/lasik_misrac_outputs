  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function and the related definitions. There are no unreachable code fragments to report because:\n\n- The call to sem_timedwait can legitimately return 0 on success or -1 on failure, and the code handles both cases (success branch, errno == ETIMEDOUT branch, and other-failure branch). Each branch is reachable depending on runtime conditions.\n- The result variable is assigned in every control path before the final return, so there is no dead code dependent on an uninitialized or unused value.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usage (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) with the call impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) reduces to a valid token pointer (address of *token is token), so that lookup is not a compile-time-unreachable expression.\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime contains no early returns or constant conditions that would make subsequent code unreachable; it always computes the absolute time and returns to the caller.\n- There are no constant boolean conditions, unconditional jumps, or return statements preceding other statements that would render portions of this function unreachable.\n\nGiven these points, I found no code fragments in the provided function that appear to be unreachable and therefore none require further investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1."
