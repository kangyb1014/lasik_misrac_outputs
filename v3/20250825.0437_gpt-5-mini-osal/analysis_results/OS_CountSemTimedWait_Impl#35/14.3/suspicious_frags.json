  "explanation": "No controlling expressions that are manifestly invariant were found in the provided code. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions (typically in loops or conditionals used as loop controls). In OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl there are no loops; the conditional if/else-if expressions depend on runtime results (sem_timedwait return value and errno) and therefore are not invariant. The helper OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime contains an if that adjusts tv_nsec based on computed values (clock_gettime and msecs) and is not an invariant controlling expression. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the data structure definitions do not introduce any loop/control expressions. Thus there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
