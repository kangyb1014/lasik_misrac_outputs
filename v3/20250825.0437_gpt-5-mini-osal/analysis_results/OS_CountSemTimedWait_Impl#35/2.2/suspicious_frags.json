  "explanation": "No executed operations in the provided code appear to be dead code. Rationale: \n- The lookup impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token) produces a pointer used later to reference impl->id for sem_timedwait; removing it would change behaviour. The macro expansion effectively computes the object index from the token and is not an unused assignment.\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts) writes the absolute timeout into ts; that value is passed to sem_timedwait and thus affects behaviour. The adjustments to tv_sec/tv_nsec are used and necessary.\n- The sem_timedwait call is the observable operation whose return and errno determine the control flow; the three assignment branches (OS_SUCCESS, OS_SEM_TIMEOUT, OS_SEM_FAILURE) all affect the returned result. None of these assignments are unused.\n- All declared variables (ts, result, impl) are used after their initialization/assignment; there are no assignments whose results are never used.\n- Comments and macro definitions are not executable and therefore not relevant to Rule 2.2.\n\nGiven the visible code and the related definitions provided, there is no executed code whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so no code fragments require investigation for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
