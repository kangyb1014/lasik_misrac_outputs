  "explanation": "No functions in the provided fragment call OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl either directly or indirectly. OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl invokes pthread_mutex_unlock and uses the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro. The macro expands to an array access that calls the inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, which merely returns token->obj_idx and does not call back into OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl. The standard library function pthread_mutex_unlock is external and does not call application functions. The use of & (address-of) in the macro with the argument *token yields &(*token) (i.e. token) and does not introduce recursion. Therefore there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation for Rule 17.2 (self-calls or indirect recursion)."
