  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning: \n- The function parameter token is declared as const OS_object_token_t * (pointer-to-const) so it complies with the rule. \n- The macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token) effectively passes &(*token) (a const OS_object_token_t *) to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to accept a const OS_object_token_t *, so the token usage is const-correct. \n- The array OS_impl_condvar_table is a non-const table of OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t whose elements contain pthread synchronization primitives. The impl pointer is declared as OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t * (non-const) and is used to call pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mut). pthread_mutex_unlock expects a pointer to a mutable pthread_mutex_t because unlocking modifies mutex state; therefore impl must not be a pointer-to-const. Making the table or impl pointer const would be incorrect. \n- No other pointers in the provided fragments point to non-const types that could reasonably be made const without breaking required operations (e.g., mutating the mutex). \nGiven these points, there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
