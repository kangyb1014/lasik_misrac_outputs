  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned in this function. The parameters are: task_id (passed/used by value) and entrypt (a pointer). The code assigns to *entrypt (twice) which modifies the object pointed to \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8 \u2014 and does not reassign the pointer parameter entrypt itself. No other parameter is modified or reassigned. All other uses (passing task_id to functions, taking &token for a local variable) do not change the parameter variables. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
