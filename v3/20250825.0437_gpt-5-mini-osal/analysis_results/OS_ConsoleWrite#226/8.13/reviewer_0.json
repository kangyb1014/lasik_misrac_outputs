True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. void OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl(OS_object_token_t *token)) but does not modify the pointed-to token, then the parameter should be declared as const OS_object_token_t * and this call constitutes (or reveals) a Rule 8.13 violation. In other words, if the implementation does not alter *token, the missing const on the function parameter violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is inconclusive as stated and therefore the reported violation is not proven by the call site alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to refer to const-qualified types whenever possible \u2014 that is a requirement on pointer declarations (including function parameter types and definitions), not on a single call site. The code shown simply passes &token to OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl. Whether a Rule 8.13 violation exists depends on the declaration/definition of OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl and whether that function actually modifies the pointed-to OS_object_token_t:\n\n- If OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl is declared as taking OS_object_token_t * and its implementation does not modify *token, then the function parameter should indeed be declared const OS_object_token_t * and the current prototype/definition would violate Rule 8.13. In that case Agent A\u2019s concern about the function signature would be correct.\n- If OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl legitimately modifies *token, then the non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no Rule 8.13 violation.\n\nBecause the target code does not include the prototype/definition of OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl, you cannot conclude a violation from the call site alone. Therefore the report as applied to the shown code is not proven correct \u2014 verify the function\u2019s declaration/definition to determine compliance."
