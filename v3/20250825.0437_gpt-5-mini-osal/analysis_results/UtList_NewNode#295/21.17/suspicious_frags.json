  "explanation": "Only the fragments that allocate the buffer and that call or prepare the destination for the string.h functions are reported. These are the only locations in the function that can affect whether the subsequent memset/memcpy access memory beyond allocated bounds. The other lines in the function do not call any <string.h> functions and do not perform pointer arithmetic or memory accesses that would extend beyond the allocated object: the union definition is for alignment, Node.DataSize merely stores a value, Next/Prev initializations set internal pointers to the node itself, and the return statement just returns the node address. Therefore no additional fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
