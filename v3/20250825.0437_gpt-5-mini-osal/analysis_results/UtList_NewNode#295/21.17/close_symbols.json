  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (struct definition): needed to know the exact layout and size of the node header (fields, padding, and where the Node.Data pointer and any other fields sit). Determining whether memcpy writes are within bounds requires understanding how large the header is and where the appended data region begins relative to the Node object.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): required to know the width, range and signedness of DataSize as used in the allocation and memcpy length. If DataSize has unexpected width or is signed this can affect overflow/size calculations and whether the number of bytes copied matches the allocated tail size.\n\n- malloc (prototype/semantics from <stdlib.h>): required to confirm the semantics that malloc(sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize) allocates that many bytes and returns a pointer to a block of at least the requested size (or NULL on failure). Also needed to reason about integer conversions passed to malloc and how allocation size is computed.\n\n- memcpy (prototype/semantics from <string.h>): required because the MISRA rule concerns use of string/memory functions. You must know that memcpy(dst, src, n) will attempt to read n bytes from src and write n bytes to dst; this is essential to verify that dst (the appended area &AllocNode[1]) really has at least DataSize bytes and that src (Data) has at least DataSize bytes.\n\n- memset (prototype/semantics from <string.h>): although memset is used only to zero the header area, its semantics are relevant to check that the call does not write beyond the header and to reason about initialization vs. appended buffer (why only sizeof(union) is zeroed and appended DataSize bytes are not).\n\n- size_t (typedef) and SIZE_MAX (macro): required to reason about integer arithmetic when computing sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize (possible overflow of the size expression), and to ensure conversions between DataSize and the size parameter types of malloc/memcpy are safe. Checking against SIZE_MAX lets you determine whether the addition could wrap and produce a smaller allocation, which would lead to out-of-bounds accesses by memcpy and thus a MISRA violation."
