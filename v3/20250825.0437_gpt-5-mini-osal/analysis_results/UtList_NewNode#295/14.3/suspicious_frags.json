  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in loop constructs (for, while, do-while). The provided function contains no loop constructs (no for, while, or do-while) and no other controlling expressions that would be subject to this rule. The do-while exception is not applicable because there is no do-while present. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
