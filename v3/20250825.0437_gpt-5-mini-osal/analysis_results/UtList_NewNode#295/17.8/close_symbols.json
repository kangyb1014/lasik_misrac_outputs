  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: The function assigns to AllocNode->Node.Data and AllocNode->Node.DataSize. To determine whether these assignments could actually be modifying the incoming parameter named Data or DataSize (e.g. via aliasing, unusual typedefs, or macros), the structure definition is needed to confirm member names and types (that Node.Data is an independent member, not a macro or alias to the parameter).\\n- uint32: The type of the DataSize parameter must be known to confirm it is a simple scalar (passed by value) and not some sort of pointer/type alias that could be modified indirectly.\\n- malloc (prototype from <stdlib.h>): Knowing the prototype ensures the call signature and that no pointer parameter of the function (i.e. the function does not accept a pointer-to-Data parameter that could cause Data to be modified). It also clarifies the returned pointer type.\\n- memcpy (prototype from <string.h>): memcpy's prototype (const void * for the source) is required to confirm that passing the parameter Data as the source cannot cause the pointer variable Data itself to be modified by memcpy (only the pointee may be written).\\n- memset (prototype from <string.h>): Included for completeness to check its parameter types and to ensure it does not take a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise modify function parameters.\\n- size_t: The standard size type used in malloc/memcpy/memset prototypes should be known so prototypes are fully understood.\\nThese symbols let an analyzer determine whether any statements or called library functions in UtList_NewNode modify the formal parameters (the pointer Data or the scalar DataSize) rather than only the objects they point to, which is exactly what the MISRA rule forbids."
