  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for potential dead code: the union NodeAllocator is a type-level construct used to guarantee alignment (not an executed operation), so its members being unused is not an executed dead operation. The assignment AllocNode->Node.Data = &AllocNode[1]; establishes the data-area pointer and is required for correct memory layout. AllocNode->Node.DataSize = DataSize and the final return &AllocNode->Node are functional and used by callers. The helper functions UtList_GetHead, UtList_Add and UtList_Insert_Before contain control flow and pointer updates that are exercised at runtime (e.g. Tag bounds check, tag assignment, and the four list-link updates in Insert_Before) and are not obviously redundant; their operations affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code removal without deeper semantic analysis. Consequently only the listed fragments warrant further inspection for possible dead/ redundant operations (e.g. allocations without null-check, zeroing already-overwritten fields, or initializations that are immediately overwritten by callers)."
