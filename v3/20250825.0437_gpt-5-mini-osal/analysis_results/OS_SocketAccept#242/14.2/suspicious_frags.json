  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function body, so there are no in-scope for loops to inspect for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The rule specifically targets the three clauses of a for statement (initialization, condition, iteration) and the use/modification of the loop counter and control flags; none of these constructs appear in the shown code. Macros or called functions (e.g. OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_SocketAccept_Impl, etc.) could contain for loops, but their definitions are not part of the supplied fragment and therefore cannot be assessed here. If Rule 14.2 coverage is required for the entire module, those macro and function definitions should be inspected separately; however, within the provided code there are no for loops to report as suspicious."
