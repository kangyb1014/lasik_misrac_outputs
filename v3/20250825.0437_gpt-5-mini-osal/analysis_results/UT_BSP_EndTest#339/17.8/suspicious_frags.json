  "explanation": "The selected fragments are all places where the parameter TestCounters is dereferenced or passed to another function and therefore are the only locations relevant to Rule 17.8 (modification of a function parameter or the pointer itself). No assignment to the parameter variable TestCounters appears anywhere in the function (there is no statement like \"TestCounters = ...\"), so there is no direct modification of the pointer itself in other lines. Other code fragments (declaration and use of the local array Message, calls to UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, and OS_BSP_SetExitCode) do not reference or modify the TestCounters parameter and therefore do not need investigation under this rule."
