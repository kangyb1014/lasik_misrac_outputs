Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (why required to decide MISRA 'for loop well-formed' compliance):\n\n- UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls this function when TestSegmentCount > 1. Any for-loops inside this function (or their formation) must be checked because the MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body if they are invoked from a for-loop; additionally, loops here could themselves violate MISRA even if UT_BSP_EndTest has none.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport calls UT_BSP_DoText. Transitive callees must be inspected for for-loops or modifications of loop counters/flags used in any for-loops encountered in the call chain.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls UT_BSP_Lock directly (and UT_BSP_DoText may also call it). If UT_BSP_Lock contains loops or modifies objects used as loop counters/flags in enclosing loops, that affects compliance. Need its body to ensure it contains no ill-formed for-loops or side-effects relevant to loops.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl\n  - UT_BSP_Lock calls this implementation. The concrete implementation could contain loops or modify global objects used as loop counters/flags; inspect to determine compliance.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls UT_BSP_Unlock (and UT_BSP_DoText may call it). Same rationale as UT_BSP_Lock: its body might contain loops or side effects relevant to loop well-formedness.\n\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl\n  - UT_BSP_Unlock delegates to this implementation. Must inspect for loops or modifications of objects that could be used as loop counters or control flags.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls this to output the Message. The implementation may iterate over the buffer (for-loop), and such loops must be checked for the three-clause requirements and single-counter rule.\n\n- OS_BSP_SetExitCode\n  - Called to set process exit code. Its implementation may contain loops or modify objects that interact with loop counters/control flags; include to be thorough.\n\n- UtAssert_TestCounter_t (type/definition)\n  - The structure is examined/used by UT_BSP_EndTest and passed to callees. If callees iterate over fields inside the struct (e.g., CaseCount arrays, segments) they may contain for-loops whose loop counters/conditions depend on struct layout/types; the type definition and sizes are needed to understand index/loop usage.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_TSF, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_TTF\n  - These constants/macros are used to index CaseCount. If any called function iterates over CaseCount using these constants, you need their values to check loop bounds/indices and ensure loops use only permitted counters and do not modify other objects used in the loop condition or increment.\n\n- snprintf\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls snprintf. Although typically part of the C library, its implementation may contain loops; include if project requires checking library code for MISRA compliance, or at least to acknowledge library calls that could hide for-loops.\n\n- strlen\n  - UT_BSP_EndTest calls strlen. As with snprintf, strlen may iterate over the string; its implementation would need inspection if library internals are in-scope for the MISRA check.\n\nNotes:\n- The focus is on any functions (direct or transitive) called from UT_BSP_EndTest because MISRA treats behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body when a for-loop exists in the caller; conversely, for-loops inside those callee functions themselves must individually satisfy the rule. The symbols above cover the direct callees and their immediate implementations and the data types/constants used by UT_BSP_EndTest that could affect loop construction or indexing. If further transitive callees exist inside any of the listed implementations, their symbols should be added similarly."
