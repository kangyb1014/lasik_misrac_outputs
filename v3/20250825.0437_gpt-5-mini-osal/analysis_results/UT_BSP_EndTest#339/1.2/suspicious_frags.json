  "explanation": "I reviewed the entire function. There are no tokens or constructs that are known compiler language extensions (no __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, inline-asm, nonstandard pragmas, or compiler-specific keywords). The array declaration (char Message[128]) is a fixed-size array (not a VLA). The cast to (unsigned int), use of snprintf and strlen, pointer dereference TestCounters->..., and conditional/assignment constructs are standard C. The other identifiers (UT_BSP_Lock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_SetExitCode, UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport, UtAssert_TestCounter_t, and the enum/constants) are application-defined symbols, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that explicitly use compiler language extensions and nothing needs to be flagged for Rule 1.2."
