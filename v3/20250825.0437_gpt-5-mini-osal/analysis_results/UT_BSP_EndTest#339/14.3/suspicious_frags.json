  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The function contains two if-statements whose controlling expressions depend on members of the TestCounters structure (TestCounters->TestSegmentCount and entries of TestCounters->CaseCount[]) which are runtime values and therefore not constant/invariant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. Other expressions that use compile-time constants (e.g. sizeof(Message), OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS) are not controlling expressions and thus not relevant to Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
