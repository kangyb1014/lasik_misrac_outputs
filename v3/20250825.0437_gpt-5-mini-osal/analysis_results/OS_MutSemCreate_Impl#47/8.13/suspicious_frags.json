  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning for not selecting any fragments for further investigation:\n\n- The function parameter token is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, satisfying the rule that the pointer points to a const-qualified type when possible.\n- The local pointer impl is used to obtain a mutable record from OS_impl_mutex_table and is later used to initialize impl->id via pthread_mutex_init. Since the pointed-to data is modified (mutex initialization changes the pthread_mutex_t), impl must point to a non-const type; therefore no const qualification is appropriate.\n- The local variable mutex_attr is passed to pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, and pthread_mutexattr_settype, all of which modify the attribute object. Thus mutex_attr cannot be const and the pointer usages are appropriate.\n- pthread_mutex_init takes a const pthread_mutexattr_t * for its second parameter; passing &mutex_attr (a non-const object) is allowed and necessary because the same object is modified earlier. Making mutex_attr const would prevent those earlier modifications, so it is not possible nor desirable here.\n- The macro usage OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_mutex_table, *token) expands to a subscript using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)). OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a const OS_object_token_t *, so the const qualification is preserved for the index computation; there is no loss of const correctness requiring investigation.\n- OS_ObjectIdFromToken is declared to take a const OS_object_token_t *, and it is called with token (const), so that use is correct.\n- strerror returns a char * (implementation-defined) and is used only for diagnostic messages; this is a POSIX API characteristic and not something to change here to satisfy Rule 8.13.\n- The global array OS_impl_mutex_table contains mutable mutex records (their pthread_mutex_t elements are initialized/modified at runtime), so it must be non-const.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer usages in the provided code that could sensibly be made to point to const-qualified types without breaking required behavior; therefore no suspicious fragments are reported."
