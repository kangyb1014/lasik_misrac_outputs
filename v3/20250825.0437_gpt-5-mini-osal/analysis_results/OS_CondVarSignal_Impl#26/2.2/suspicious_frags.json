  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. Every statement in OS_CondVarSignal_Impl is executed and can affect program behaviour: the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expression obtains the condvar record used by pthread_cond_signal; the call to pthread_cond_signal(&impl->cv) performs the synchronization action; the return-paths map the pthread result into OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR and are reachable and meaningful. The local variable status is used to test the call result. The wrapper OS_CondVarSignal only calls the impl function when OS_ObjectIdGetById succeeds, so there is no unreachable or redundant initialization/assignment here. The macro expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET with argument *token reduces to &(*token) (i.e. token) and does not introduce a redundant or dead operation. Therefore, no operations appear to be removable without changing behaviour, and nothing in the provided code meets the definition of dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
