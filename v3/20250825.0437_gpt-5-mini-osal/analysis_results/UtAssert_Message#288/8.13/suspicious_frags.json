  "explanation": "Other pointer-related items in this function do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the parameters File and Spec are declared as const char * (already const-qualified), and the local declaration const char *BaseName is const-qualified. The va_list object (va) is not a pointer type governed by this rule. No other pointer declarations appear in the function, so only the listed code fragments merit further review."
