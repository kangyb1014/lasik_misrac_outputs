The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect the bodies of every function that UtAssert_Message calls (and the functions those call) because MISRA's for-loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body. Although UtAssert_Message itself contains no for statement, it invokes UT_BSP_DoText and several standard library string/format functions; any ill-formed for loop inside those functions (or in the functions UT_BSP_DoText calls) would mean the overall behaviour (when UtAssert_Message executes) violates the rule. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Direct callee of UtAssert_Message; its implementation must be checked for any for loops and for calls to other functions that might contain for loops.\n- UT_BSP_Lock: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; its body could contain for loops or call further functions with loops that affect well-formedness.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; I/O implementations often iterate buffers \u2014 must be checked for for-loop compliance.\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; its implementation could include for loops that count or modify objects used elsewhere.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; check for loops or side-effecting loop counters.\n- UT_BSP_Unlock: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; check for loops or modifications of loop counters within functions it calls.\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Callee of UT_BSP_DoText; include because it may contain loops or call functions that do.\n- strrchr: Called by UtAssert_Message; library implementation may use loops \u2014 include to confirm no ill-formed for loops are present when called from this function.\n- snprintf: Called by UtAssert_Message; formatting routines may contain loops \u2014 include to verify compliance.\n- vsnprintf: Called by UtAssert_Message; variable-argument formatting routine is directly in the execution path and must be checked for for-loops that violate the rule.\n- strlen: Called by UtAssert_Message (via MsgLen = strlen(FinalMessage)); include because its implementation may contain loops.\n\nNote: va_start/va_end are macros and the va_list type are not included because they do not themselves contain for statements; however the formatting functions (vsnprintf/snprintf) that consume the va_list are listed. The next analyst should inspect the implementations of the listed symbols (and any further callees found during that inspection) to determine whether any for loops are present and whether they are well-formed per the MISRA constraints."
