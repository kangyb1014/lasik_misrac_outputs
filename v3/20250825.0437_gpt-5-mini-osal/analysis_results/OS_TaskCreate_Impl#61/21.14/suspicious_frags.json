  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp or any code that compares null-terminated strings using memcmp are present in this function. The only memory/string-related operation is memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)) which zero-initializes a union (not a string comparison) and is compliant with the rule. Assignments (arg.id = ...), table lookups (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), and the call to OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl(..., arg.opaque_arg) do not themselves use memcmp in this fragment. If memcmp misuse exists it would be inside other functions (e.g. OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl or macros), but those are outside the provided code and thus not subject to investigation here. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments in the given code to investigate for Rule 21.14."
