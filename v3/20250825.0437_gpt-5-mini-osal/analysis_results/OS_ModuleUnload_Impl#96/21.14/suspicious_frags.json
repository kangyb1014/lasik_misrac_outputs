  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_ModuleUnload_Impl and all related definitions included in the additional code. There is no use of memcmp anywhere in the target function, the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the OS_impl_module_table declaration, the OS_impl_module_internal_record_t type, or the OS_DEBUG macro. The only string-related usage is calling dlerror() and passing its result to OS_DEBUG (which expands to nothing here), but there is no string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the codebase (not provided), those files should be scanned, but within the provided fragments there are no occurrences to investigate."
