Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemGive_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemGive_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (sem_post(&impl->id) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CountSemGive_Impl:\nOS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_MAX_COUNT_SEMAPHORES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    sem_t id;\n} OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SEM_FAILURE (-6)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The provided static inline accessor simply returns token->obj_idx and, on its own, does not constitute dead code. There is no evidence that the function body is executed in a way that could be removed without affecting behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. (A concrete violation scenario would be if calls to this function were present only for their side-effects-less value and every call site discarded the return value \u2014 e.g. calling OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token); with the result unused \u2014 so that executing the accessor could be removed without changing program behaviour.)"
