  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were judged not suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they are either: (1) structural/necessary declarations (e.g. the function signature of OS_CountSemGive_Impl) that are plainly required for correct linkage and cannot be removed without changing program behaviour; (2) clearly used elsewhere in the shown snippets (so their removal would affect behaviour); or (3) simple constant/macro definitions or type declarations that serve as essential interfaces rather than executable operations. The reported fragments cover all parts of the provided code that could plausibly represent code whose execution might be redundant or potentially removable without changing behaviour (e.g. an inline helper that may be unused, the table definition, the sem_post branch and return values). Other lines were omitted because they are either directly involved in observable behaviour or are non-executable type/structure declarations that do not meet the definition of dead code."
