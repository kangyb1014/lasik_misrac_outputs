  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemGive_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemGive_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (sem_post(&impl->id) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CountSemGive_Impl:\nOS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_MAX_COUNT_SEMAPHORES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    sem_t id;\n} OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SEM_FAILURE (-6)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_MAX_COUNT_SEMAPHORES]\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The global array OS_impl_count_sem_table is accessed by OS_CountSemGive_Impl (via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) to obtain the impl->id used in sem_post. Removing the array would change program behavior (the function would no longer have valid storage for semaphore records), so this definition is not dead code."
