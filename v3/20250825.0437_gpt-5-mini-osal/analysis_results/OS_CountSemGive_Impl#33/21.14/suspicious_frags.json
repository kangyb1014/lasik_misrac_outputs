  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_CountSemGive_Impl and the related definitions. The function only performs a table lookup via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, accesses a sem_t member (impl->id), and calls sem_post. The supporting code shows OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returns an integer index and OS_impl_count_sem_table is an array of records containing a sem_t; there are no uses of memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any other C standard library string-comparison functions in the supplied fragments. Therefore there are no code fragments in the given code that use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and nothing here needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you want analysis across other files, please provide those sources so I can search for any memcmp usages comparing NUL-terminated strings."
