  "scenario": "In the given code the controlling expression (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE) depends on the runtime parameter 'flags' and a bitmask, so it is not invariant and does not violate Rule 14.3. A specific violation scenario would occur if OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE were defined as 0 (making the expression always 0/false) or if 'flags' were a compile-time constant with a fixed value \u2014 then the expression would be invariant and would violate the rule."
