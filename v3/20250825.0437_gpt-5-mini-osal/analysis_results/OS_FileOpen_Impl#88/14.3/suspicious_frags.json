  "explanation": "I have listed all controlling expressions (switch/if) in the function; those are the only places Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) could apply. Other code in the function consists of assignments, initializations, bitwise operations used to build flags, the open() call and error handling, macro/table lookups, and the boolean assignment to impl->selectable. These are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and do not need investigation under this rule."
