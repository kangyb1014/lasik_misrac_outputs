  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs do not contain function calls or call-like macros that could lead to direct or indirect recursion and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 17.2: the access_mode switch only assigns integer values; the bitwise ORs that build os_perm and the tests for flags are pure integer operations; os_mode is a constant bitmask assignment; the checks of impl->fd (< 0) and the assignment impl->selectable = ((os_perm & O_NONBLOCK) != 0) are simple evaluations and assignments; the return statements return scalar constants (OS_ERROR / OS_SUCCESS). The OS_DEBUG usage in the additional code is defined as an empty macro, so it cannot introduce a call chain. Constants/macros such as OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS and the S_I* permission constants are compile-time/macro values and do not cause function calls. Therefore they are not relevant to detecting self/indirect calls for Rule 17.2."
