In that case removing this single assignment would not change observable program behaviour (no reads of impl->selectable, no timing or side-effects), so the line is dead code. For example, if OS_impl_file_internal_record_t.selectable is never referenced by any other function (no select/poll logic uses it) then this write is executed but has no effect and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileOpen_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_file_internal_record_t OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int  fd;\n    bool selectable;\n} OS_impl_file_internal_record_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_WRITE_ONLY 1\n...\n#define OS_READ_ONLY 0\n...\n#define OS_READ_WRITE 2\n...\nextern const int OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A's argument is logically correct in principle but not provable from the snippets provided. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The assignment\n\n    impl->selectable = ((os_perm & O_NONBLOCK) != 0);\n\nis dead only if the selectable field is never read (or otherwise observed) anywhere in the entire project and the write has no side effects. From the code shown we cannot conclude that: OS_impl_filehandle_table is a global table (extern) and other translation units may legitimately read impl->selectable (e.g. select/poll logic, debugging, or external consumers). Therefore you cannot assert a rule 2.2 violation without whole\u2011project analysis (search for reads of selectable or confirm the field is unused). If a full project scan shows selectable is never read, then the assignment is dead and would violate Rule 2.2; otherwise there is no violation. In short: the report is not proven/correct based on the evidence given."
