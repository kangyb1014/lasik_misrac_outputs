  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown fragment. The function only passes a pointer to a local buffer (local_path) to OS_FileChmod_Impl after OS_TranslatePath returned success; there are no string.h calls here. A violation could occur only if (1) OS_TranslatePath did not ensure the path is null-terminated and within OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN or (2) OS_FileChmod_Impl uses a string.h routine (e.g. strcpy/strcat/memcpy) that writes beyond the bounds of the object referred to by local_path. Those conditions are not visible in the fragment, so based on the provided code the rule is not violated."
