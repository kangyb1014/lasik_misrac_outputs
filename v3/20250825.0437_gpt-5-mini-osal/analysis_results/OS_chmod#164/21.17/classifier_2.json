  "scenario": "The declaration itself does not invoke any <string.h> functions, so by itself it does not violate Rule 21.17. A violation can occur if the buffer is later written by a string-handling routine without guaranteeing the destination size. For example, if OS_TranslatePath(local_path, ...) or OS_FileChmod_Impl() performs strcpy(local_path, path) (or memcpy/local_path, ..., n) and the length of the source string (or n) is >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, then strcpy/memcpy would write beyond local_path and violate Rule 21.17."
