  "scenario": "The declaration is an array (char local_path[...]) used as a mutable local buffer, not a pointer declaration. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations pointing to const-qualified types when possible; it does not apply to this array. Making the array const would prevent it from being used as an output buffer (it is written to by OS_TranslatePath), so no change is appropriate."
