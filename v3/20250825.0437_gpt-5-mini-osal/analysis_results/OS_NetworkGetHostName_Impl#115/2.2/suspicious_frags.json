  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not flagged because they are clearly used in program behaviour or are necessary control/return constructs and therefore unlikely to be dead code: the gethostname() error-handling branch assigns the error return and the function returns that value; the local variable declarations and the final return statements are required; the OS_CHECK_POINTER/OS_CHECK_SIZE calls perform parameter validation (their expansion may vary, but they affect behaviour when enabled); the assignment to return_code in the error branch is used by the caller; the comment blocks and control-flow structure (if/else) are normal and not removable without changing behaviour. The vsnprintf result handling, buffer termination, and console write are included above as suspicious fragments to investigate; other lines (function signatures, braces, the if(gethostname(...)) test, and simple assignments that are visibly used later) are not reported because removing them would obviously alter program operation and thus are not candidate dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2."
