  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(char *host_name, size_t name_len)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    if (gethostname(host_name, name_len) < 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * posix does not say that the name is always\n         * null terminated, so its worthwhile to ensure it\n         */\n        host_name[name_len - 1] = 0;\n        return_code             = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl:\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nint32 OS_NetworkGetHostName(char *host_name, size_t name_len)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len);\n\n    /* delegate to low-level API */\n    return_code = OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(host_name, name_len);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* return an empty string on failure, just in case */\n        host_name[0] = 0;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE - 1;\n        }\n\n        msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0;\n\n        OS_ConsoleWrite(OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfConsoleId, msg_buffer);\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nactualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The assignment actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va); is not dead code. It is executed when OS_printf is called while OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState == OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER and OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled is true. The call has observable side effects (it writes the formatted output into msg_buffer) and its return value (actualsz) is subsequently used to decide error handling, truncation, and the position for the terminating NUL. Removing this assignment/call would change program behavior (no formatted output, incorrect truncation/termination), so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
