  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Analysis details:\n\n- Parameters: host_name (char *) and name_len (size_t).\n- The only write involving a parameter is host_name[name_len - 1] = 0; this modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter, which the rule explicitly allows. The pointer host_name itself is not reassigned or modified anywhere in the function.\n- name_len is used but not assigned to or otherwise modified.\n- The call gethostname(host_name, name_len) may modify the buffer pointed to by host_name, but modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter via a callee is permitted by the rule.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 17.8 (no pointer parameter reassignment and no modification of non-pointer parameters)."
