  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for the MISRA-C invariant-controlling-expression check:\n\n- gethostname\n  - The controlling expression is \"gethostname(host_name, name_len) < 0\". To determine whether that expression can be invariant you must know the actual declaration/definition and semantics of gethostname (return type, possible return values, side-effects, and whether it can return different results at runtime). If gethostname is a normal POSIX function that can return variable results, the expression is not invariant; if it is implemented/defined to always return a constant value, the expression would be invariant.\n\n- preprocessor macro(s) that redefine gethostname (e.g. #define gethostname ...)\n  - A compile-time macro could replace the function call with a constant or an expression that is invariant. You need to inspect any #define or macro expansion for gethostname in the translation unit or included headers to rule out a compile-time constant controlling expression.\n\n- link-time or unit-test stub implementation that can replace gethostname (test-harness replacement)\n  - In many test builds the real gethostname may be replaced by a stub (link-time or test-harness provided) that always returns a fixed value. To determine invariance you must know whether such a replacement exists (and what value it returns) in the build/configuration being analyzed.\n\n- OS_NetworkGetHostName (the caller of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl)\n  - To fully determine whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant in the deployed/used program you must inspect callers. A caller might always call this implementation with constant arguments or within a context where behavior is constrained (or might arrange that gethostname is replaced). Examining OS_NetworkGetHostName (and its build/test variants) shows how OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl is used and whether external conditions could render the controlling expression invariant.\n\nOnly symbols that can affect whether the controlling expression can be evaluated to the same value in all runs are listed; OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS and the local parameter names are not needed to decide if the controlling expression itself is invariant (they affect control-flow after the condition, not whether the condition is constant)."
