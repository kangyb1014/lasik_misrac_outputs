  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional is if (gethostname(host_name, name_len) < 0) \u2014 its value depends on the runtime result of gethostname and therefore is not a compile-time or loop-invariant constant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) whose controlling expressions could be invariant, and no other conditional expressions present. The assignment host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 and the return statements are not controlling expressions and thus not relevant to Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
