  "explanation": "I inspected the entire implementation of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl and the provided related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp (direct or via macros), nor any other memory-comparison operation that would equate to using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The function only calls gethostname and explicitly sets host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 to ensure termination; this assignment is not a memcmp use. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
