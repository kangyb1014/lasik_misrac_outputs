  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol:\n\n- gethostname\n  - Needed to know the exact prototype and runtime semantics: how many bytes the function may write (it is called with a length parameter), its return values (0 on success, -1 on error on POSIX), and the documented behavior that it may not NUL-terminate the buffer if the hostname is truncated. This determines whether the code\u2019s explicit host_name[name_len-1] = 0 is sufficient and whether gethostname itself can write beyond the supplied length.\n\n- OS_NetworkGetHostName (the caller/wrapper)\n  - The wrapper that calls OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl must be inspected to see what values it passes in for host_name and name_len and whether it performs any precondition checks (e.g. ensures name_len > 0, non-NULL host_name). Proving absence of out-of-bounds access requires knowing the callers\u2019 contracts and any argument validation they perform.\n\n- caller buffer-size constants (e.g. OS_MAX_HOST_NAME_LEN or equivalent)\n  - Many code-bases use compile-time constants to allocate host_name buffers. Those symbols show the expected/required buffer sizes and whether those sizes can ever be zero or smaller than the name_len passed into the Impl. They are required to prove that the write to host_name[name_len - 1] is within bounds.\n\n- callers of OS_NetworkGetHostName that allocate/pass host_name and name_len\n  - To determine whether name_len can be zero or smaller than the actual allocated buffer size, you must inspect actual callers (not just this Impl). These callers may allocate the buffer, compute name_len, or use constants; they determine whether the Impl\u2019s index write can be out of bounds.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR\n  - While these do not affect bounds directly, they are needed to fully understand which branch is taken on gethostname success/failure and therefore whether the write host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 is executed. This is necessary to reason about when the potentially risky write occurs.\n\nIn summary, to decide if the function violates the MISRA rule against out-of-bounds string accesses you must (1) inspect gethostname\u2019s guarantees about writes and null-termination, (2) inspect the wrapper and all callers to ensure name_len >= 1 and that host_name points to an object at least name_len bytes long, and (3) confirm when the code path that writes host_name[name_len-1] executes. The symbols above are exactly those needed to perform that proof."
