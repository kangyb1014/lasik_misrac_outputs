  "explanation": "int32: The function return type is int32 (not a standard C type name). Its typedef/definition must be inspected to ensure it is a plain typedef to a standard integer type and does not rely on compiler extensions (e.g. use of __extension__, compiler-specific integer types, or attributes).\n\nsize_t: Although standard, the precise typedef/definition in the included headers should be checked to ensure it is a normal typedef and not using compiler-specific extensions or attributes that would trigger the MISRA rule.\n\ngethostname: The call to gethostname requires the function prototype/declaration. System headers sometimes declare library calls using compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, visibility pragmas, or macro wrappers). Inspecting the gethostname declaration ensures no language extensions are being introduced via that symbol.\n\nOS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: These macros/constants determine the values assigned in the function. Their definitions may be macros or expressions that use compiler extensions (e.g. statement expressions, attributes, or __extension__). They must be inspected to confirm they are simple constants/enum values not using extensions."
