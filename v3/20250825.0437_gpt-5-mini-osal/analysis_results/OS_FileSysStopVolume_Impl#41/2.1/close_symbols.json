  "explanation": "To decide if OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) you must examine the call graph and any symbols that can affect reachability or control flow:\n\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize: This function is a direct caller of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl (per the call graph). You must inspect it to see whether the call site(s) to the target are compiled and reachable at runtime (e.g. conditional calls, early returns, etc.).\n\n- OS_rmfs: This is the other direct caller listed. Analyze it to determine whether it is ever invoked (and whether the call into the target is reachable within it).\n\n- OS_mkfs and OS_initfs: These are callers of OS_FileSys_Initialize in the provided graph. To establish a path from program entry to the target, you must know whether these upstream routines are reachable/used by the system (or whether they themselves are dead/unreferenced). They are required to trace reachability transitively.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol. You must inspect its definition to ensure it is a simple constant and does not carry any attributes/macros (for example a noreturn wrapper, or a macro that expands to control-flow affecting constructs) that could affect reachability analysis of the function body.\n\nNote: If a whole-program reachability decision is required, additional project entry points (e.g. main/startup, registration hooks) and any conditional compilation symbols that affect inclusion of the above functions may also be needed; the list above is the minimal set implied by the provided static call graph."
