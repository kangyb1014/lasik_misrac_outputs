  "explanation": "No controlling expressions are present in the function body. Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in constructs such as if, while, for, do-while, and switch. The target function contains neither conditional nor loop constructs\u2014only a comment block and a return statement returning the constant macro OS_SUCCESS. A return of a constant is not a controlling expression. The parameter token is unused but that is unrelated to Rule 14.3. The provided typedefs and macro definitions are also not controlling expressions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
