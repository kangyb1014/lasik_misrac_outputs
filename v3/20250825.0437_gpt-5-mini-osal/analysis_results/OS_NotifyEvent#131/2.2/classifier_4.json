  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NotifyEvent:\n```c\nint32 OS_NotifyEvent(OS_Event_t event, osal_id_t object_id, void *data)\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL)\n    {\n        status = OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler(event, object_id, data);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL)\n{\n    status = OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler(event, object_id, data);\n}\nelse\n{\n    status = OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in general: the if/else is not dead because at runtime either branch may execute depending on whether OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler is NULL. However, a violation would occur if it is provable that EventHandler is never NULL (e.g. initialized once at startup and never changed) \u2014 in that case the else branch (status = OS_SUCCESS) would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
