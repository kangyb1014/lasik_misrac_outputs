  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided code fragments there is no use of memcmp or any other string-comparison functions:\n\n- OS_NotifyEvent only checks whether OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler is NULL and either calls the function pointer or returns OS_SUCCESS. There are no string variables, no buffers, and no calls to memcmp/strcmp/strncmp/etc. to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- The OS_SharedGlobalVars initialization sets scalar and pointer fields (including EventHandler = NULL). It contains no string data or calls to memcmp.\n\nTherefore, within the supplied code there are no occurrences that violate Rule 21.14 and no code fragments requiring investigation for this rule. Note: the EventHandler function is invoked via a function pointer; if its implementation (not provided here) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, that implementation would need to be inspected separately."
