  "explanation": "No obviously unreachable statements (e.g. code after an unconditional return, after an infinite loop, or after a goto that always transfers control elsewhere) are present in the function body as provided. The places listed above are the only constructs that can affect control flow or cause code to be omitted by preprocessing/configuration and therefore merit investigation for Rule 2.1: \n- The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty, which removes the argument expressions from the compiled translation unit in some configurations; this can hide or remove code but does not itself create in-source unreachable statements \u2014 it should be checked for conditional compilation effects.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro takes the address of its token parameter (&(tok)), which can produce different behavior depending on whether the macro argument is an lvalue; the use here with *token should be examined to ensure no malformed/unused branches result.\n- The call to pthread_detach and the subsequent if (ret != 0) branch are the only runtime decision points; these should be inspected to ensure neither branch is impossible under the project configuration (e.g. wrappers that always return a constant), which could create unreachable code elsewhere.\n\nAll other code in the snippets (typedefs, simple inline accessors, OS_impl_task_table declaration, OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS macros, and OS_ObjectIdToInteger/OS_ObjectIdFromToken inline functions) are straightforward definitions or small helpers and do not themselves introduce unreachable source statements in this context, so they do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided code. If additional configuration or other translation-unit-level macros exist beyond the provided snippets, they should be checked separately since they can change which code is compiled."
