  "explanation": "No code in the function modifies the parameter pointer token itself. The function only reads *token (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)); this is a read/dereference and does not assign to or mutate the pointer variable token. There are no statements that assign to token, increment/decrement it, or otherwise change its value. The calls to pthread_cond_destroy(&impl->cv) and pthread_mutex_destroy(&impl->mut) operate on members of *impl and do not modify the function parameter. Variable assignments (final_status, status, impl) do not affect token. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that warrant investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
