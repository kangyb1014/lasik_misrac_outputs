Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32                              final_status;\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    final_status = OS_SUCCESS;\n    impl         = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    status = pthread_cond_destroy(&impl->cv);\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        final_status = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_destroy(&impl->mut);\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        final_status = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return final_status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CondVarDelete_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t OS_impl_condvar_table[OS_MAX_CONDVARS]\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mut;\n    pthread_cond_t  cv;\n} OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nimpl         = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
