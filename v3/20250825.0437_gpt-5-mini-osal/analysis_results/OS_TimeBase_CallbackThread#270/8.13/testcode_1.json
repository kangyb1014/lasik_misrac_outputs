The code only reads fields from *record (e.g. record->active_id) and does not modify it, so the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (const OS_common_record_t *) to express and enforce read-only access. The macro and the table are defined to yield a non-const pointer, allowing accidental modification \u2014 this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2703.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread:\n```c\nvoid OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread(osal_id_t timebase_id)\n{\n    OS_TimerSync_t                 syncfunc;\n    OS_timebase_internal_record_t *timebase;\n    OS_timecb_internal_record_t *  timecb;\n    OS_common_record_t *           record;\n    OS_object_token_t              token;\n    OS_object_token_t              cb_token;\n    uint32                         tick_time;\n    uint32                         spin_cycles;\n    int32                          saved_wait_time;\n\n    /*\n     * Register this task as a time base handler.\n     * Application code MUST NOT attempt to configure timers from the context of a\n     * timer callback, otherwise deadlock is possible.
