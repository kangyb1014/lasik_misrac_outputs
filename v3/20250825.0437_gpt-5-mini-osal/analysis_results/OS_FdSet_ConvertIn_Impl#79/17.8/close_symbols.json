  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl violates the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must be able to tell whether any of the pointer parameters (os_maxfd, os_set, OSAL_set) themselves are assigned to or otherwise modified (which would be a violation), as opposed to their pointees being modified (which is allowed). The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- FD_SET: This is the macro (or function) used to update the fd_set. We must inspect its definition/expansion to ensure it only modifies the object pointed to by os_set (i.e., *os_set) and does not perform any assignment to the os_set parameter itself or introduce other side effects on the parameter variable.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE: Used in a bounds check (osfd >= FD_SETSIZE). Knowing its definition/semantics helps confirm the check is ordinary and does not imply any hidden side effects on parameters.\n\n- fd_set (typedef/struct): The type of the second parameter. Its layout and member names show how FD_SET operates (whether it writes into the object pointed to or performs any pointer-level operations).\n\n- OS_FdSet (typedef/struct) and its member object_ids (type and length): The code reads OSAL_set->object_ids and uses sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids). We need the definition to confirm this is an ordinary array read (no macro magic) and that accessing object_ids does not modify the OSAL_set pointer itself.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: This macro/function computes an osal_index_t from an integer. Its definition must be inspected to confirm it has no side effects on parameters (e.g., it does not reference/assign os_maxfd or os_set) and that it returns a plain index value.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (declaration) and the element type (fields: fd, selectable): The code indexes this global table and reads fd and selectable. We need the declaration/type to ensure those accesses are simple reads (and that the table is not a macro or accessor that could modify the function parameters).\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The upper-limit constant used in the id comparison. Its definition ensures the comparison has no side effects.\n\n- osal_index_t, uint8, int32: The typedefs for the local/parameter types used in the function. Confirming these are plain scalar types ensures no unexpected operator overloads / macros are involved that could modify parameters.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED: The status constants assigned to the local variable status. Their definitions are needed only to check they are plain constants (no macros with side effects) and that assigning them does not modify any parameter variables.\n\nIn short, focus is on any macros or globals (FD_SET, OSAL_INDEX_C, OS_impl_filehandle_table, object_ids) that could conceal assignments to the pointer parameters. The above symbols are those that must be inspected to conclude whether only the pointees are modified (allowed) and the pointer parameters themselves remain unmodified (MISRA-compliant)."
