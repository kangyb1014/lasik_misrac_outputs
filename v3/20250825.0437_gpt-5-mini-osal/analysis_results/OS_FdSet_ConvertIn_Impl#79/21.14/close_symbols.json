  "explanation": "To check whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect any macros, types, or objects the function relies on that could expand to or call code that uses memcmp on strings. Brief reasons per symbol:\n\n- FD_SET (macro): It is a macro (or inline) that is invoked in this function. Macros can expand to code that calls functions (including memcmp) or performs string comparisons; inspect its definition to ensure no memcmp use on null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant) and fd_set (type): These are defined alongside FD_SET (typically in sys/select.h). You need the actual definitions because some implementations provide helper functions/macros operating on fd_set that could use memcmp or other string comparisons internally.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table and its type (fields fd, selectable): The code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable. The table\u2019s type or accessor macros/functions might hide helper routines that use memcmp; inspect the definition to ensure no indirect memcmp usage.\n\n- OSAL_set type and its member object_ids (including the array type/size): The loop uses sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) and indexes object_ids bytes. If object_ids is defined in a way that involves string semantics (e.g., char* or null\u2011terminated arrays) or if indexing is via accessor macros, those definitions must be checked for memcmp usage.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro/function): This macro/function is used to compute id. Its expansion could call other functions or macros that use memcmp; verify its definition.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): Used in a comparison with id; include to see if it\u2019s computed or wrapped in macros that could call memcmp (rare but include to be thorough).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (macros/constants): They are return/status symbols; include their definitions only to ensure they are simple constants and not macros that expand to function calls that might use memcmp.\n\n- uint8 and osal_index_t typedefs: Needed to understand the actual types/widths used (e.g., if object_ids is a char* vs uint8_t array) because the MISRA rule concerns null\u2011terminated strings; knowing the exact types helps rule out string comparisons.\n\nIn short, inspect the definitions/expansions of these symbols to ensure none expand to or call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The target function itself contains no direct memcmp call, but any macro/type/variable definitions it uses could hide such a call."
