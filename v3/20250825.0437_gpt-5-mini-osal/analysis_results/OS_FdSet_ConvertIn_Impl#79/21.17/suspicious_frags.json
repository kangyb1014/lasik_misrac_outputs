  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 applies only to the standard string.h functions. In the provided OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl function there are no calls to the string.h functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The FD_SET(osfd, os_set) invocation is a select/fd_set macro (not a string.h function) and the code guards the FD_SET call with a check against FD_SETSIZE, preventing out-of-range bit setting. Indexing of OSAL_set->object_ids is bounded by the loop condition offset < sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids). Accesses into OS_impl_filehandle_table are guarded by id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES. Therefore none of the other fragments in the target function involve string.h functions or appear to cause out-of-bounds accesses related to string.h usage; the only explicit string.h usage present is the provided \"size_t      length = strlen(string)\" line, which should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds / unterminated-string issues."
