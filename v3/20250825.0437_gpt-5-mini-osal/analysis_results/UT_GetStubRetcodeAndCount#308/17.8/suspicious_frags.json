  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function. The parameters are: FuncKey (passed by value), int32 *Retcode, and int32 *Count. The only operations involving the parameters are dereferences that assign to the objects pointed to: \"*Count = StubPtr->Data.Rc.Count;\" and \"*Retcode = StubPtr->Data.Rc.Value;\". MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. There are no assignments that modify the pointer variables (no statements like \"Retcode = ...\" or \"Count = ...\"), no pointer arithmetic, and FuncKey (a value parameter) is not modified. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
