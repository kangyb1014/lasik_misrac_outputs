  "explanation": "I examined the provided target function UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount and the related UT_GetStubEntry implementation and type definitions. There are no calls to the C standard library function memcmp, nor to strcmp/strncmp, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings. The code only performs numeric/enum comparisons (EntryType, FuncKey) and direct struct field accesses/assignments. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If there are other source files not provided here, those should be scanned for any uses of memcmp comparing C strings, but within the given code no such suspicious fragments exist."
