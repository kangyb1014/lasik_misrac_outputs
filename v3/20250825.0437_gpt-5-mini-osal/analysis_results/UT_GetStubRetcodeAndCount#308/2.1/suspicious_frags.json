  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in this function. Execution always reaches the assignment to StubPtr, and from there either the if (StubPtr != NULL) branch or the else branch will execute depending on the runtime value returned by UT_GetStubEntry; both branches assign Result and control flow continues to the final return Result; statement. There are no early returns, dead statements after a return, constant conditions, or unconditional loops that would make any lines unreachable. Note: dereferences of *Count and *Retcode are reachable code (they may be unsafe if the pointers are NULL at runtime) but are not unreachable and thus are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
