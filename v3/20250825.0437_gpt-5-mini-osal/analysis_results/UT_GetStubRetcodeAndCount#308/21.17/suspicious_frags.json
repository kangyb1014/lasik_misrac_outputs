  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function. The code only performs pointer dereferences and assignments: retrieving a stub entry via UT_GetStubEntry, then reading StubPtr->Data.Rc.Count and StubPtr->Data.Rc.Value and writing through the pointers *Count and *Retcode. These operations do not involve string handling library functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: There are other possible safety concerns (for example, potential NULL pointer dereferences of Retcode, Count, or the structure members if UT_GetStubEntry returns unexpected data), but those are not violations of Rule 21.17 and thus are outside the scope of this rule-based investigation."
