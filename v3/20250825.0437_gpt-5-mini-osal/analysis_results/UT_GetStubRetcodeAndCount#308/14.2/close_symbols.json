Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount can violate the MISRA C rule about well-formed for loops you must examine any symbols that can affect loop formation or introduce side-effects that would count toward the rule. The required symbols are:\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry: The function is called directly from the target function. Its implementation or any macros it expands to could contain for-loops or side effects that participate in a surrounding for-loop's behaviour (MISRA treats behaviour of called functions as part of a loop body). Also UT_GetStubEntry might modify global objects used as loop counters or flags.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_COUNTER: This macro/enum value is passed into UT_GetStubEntry. If it is a macro with side-effects or expands to an expression (rather than a simple constant), it could violate clause 2 of the rule when used in a loop header; its definition must be checked.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t: The struct type of StubPtr. Its definition is required to verify the types of Data.Rc.Count and Data.Rc.Value (e.g. whether they are integer types, volatile, or have accessor macros), and to ensure that dereferencing and assignments in the function do not implicitly modify a loop counter or rely on objects that a for-loop header might use.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t: The key type passed into UT_GetStubEntry; if it is a complex type or a macro it could carry side effects or be used in loop-control expressions when this function is inlined or used in headers. Its definition is needed to rule out hidden modifications.\n\n- int32: The concrete type behind int32 is required to confirm it is a plain integer type (not volatile, not a typedef to a struct with side-effects) so that assignments to *Retcode and *Count cannot be mistaken for loop-counter modifications.\n\n- bool: The return type (and assignment to Result) must be known to ensure no unexpected behaviour (e.g. macro redefinitions) that could interact with loop control semantics.\n\n- NULL: The null pointer constant used in the conditional must be the standard definition (not a macro with side-effects); confirm it is the normal null pointer constant.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these definitions/implementations is sufficient to determine whether the target function itself contains any for-loops that are malformed, and to ensure that nothing it invokes or expands (macros, called function, type definitions) introduces hidden for-loops or side-effects that would cause a for-loop to violate the stated MISRA rule."
