  "scenario": "No violation. Every branch and statement in the fragment can be reached: the outer if executes when obj->active_id equals expected_id; inside it the EXCLUSIVE and non-EXCLUSIVE branches are reachable depending on token->lock_mode; the inner conditional that sets the ID to RESERVED is reachable when expected_id is not already RESERVED; the else-if executes when the initial ID comparison fails and either the lock mode is NONE or the active_id is not RESERVED. Thus there is no unreachable code in this fragment."
