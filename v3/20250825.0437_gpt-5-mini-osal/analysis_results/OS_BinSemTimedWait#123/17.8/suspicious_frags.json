  "explanation": "No function parameters in OS_BinSemTimedWait are modified. The parameters sem_id and msecs are only used as input arguments (passed by value) and are not assigned to, incremented/decremented, or passed by address within this function. The local variable token is passed by address to helper functions, but token is a local object (not a function parameter) and modifying the object it points to is allowed by the rule; the rule prohibits modifying function parameters themselves. The local return_code is also only assigned locally. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
