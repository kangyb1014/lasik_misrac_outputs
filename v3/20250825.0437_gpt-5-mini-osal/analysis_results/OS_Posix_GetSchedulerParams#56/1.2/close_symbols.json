  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule: Language extensions should not be used) the analyzer must inspect the actual declarations/definitions of all non-language-standard identifiers and any macros used in the function. Specifically:\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro or function definition): OS_DEBUG is used as a logging call and is often implemented as a macro (possibly variadic) or as a wrapper that may employ compiler extensions (e.g. GCC variadic macro extensions, __attribute__, inline assembler, __extension__, etc.). The macro/definition must be examined to see if it relies on non-standard language extensions.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t (typedef/struct definition): The typedef/struct may include compiler-specific attributes, bitfields, or nonstandard type usage; its definition is required to confirm standard language constructs only are used.\n\n- sched_get_priority_max and sched_get_priority_min (declarations): These POSIX APIs are usually declared in <sched.h>, but their declarations or wrappers on the platform might be macros or annotated with compiler-specific attributes. The exact declarations must be checked to ensure they are not compiler extensions.\n\n- strerror (declaration): Typically standard, but platform headers could implement it as a macro or wrapper that uses nonstandard features; need its declaration/definition to confirm.\n\n- errno (definition/macro): errno is commonly a macro that expands to a thread-local accessor (e.g. __errno_location(), __thread usage, or other compiler-specific TLS helper). Its definition must be inspected for use of compiler extensions.\n\n- <stdbool.h> / definition of bool: The function returns 'bool' \u2014 on some platforms 'bool' may be a macro or alias to a compiler-specific type; verify whether _Bool/stdbool.h are used (standard) or a compiler extension is providing bool.\n\n- Header/source file where OS_DEBUG and POSIX_PriorityLimits_t are defined (project OSAL headers): Project headers may contain additional macros or pragmas that enable/require language extensions; review these headers in-context (including any compiler-specific #ifdefs) to determine if the code relies on extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations/definitions) allows inspection for any use of compiler-specific constructs (intrinsics, attributes, extension pragmas, nonstandard keywords/macros) that would violate the MISRA rule."
