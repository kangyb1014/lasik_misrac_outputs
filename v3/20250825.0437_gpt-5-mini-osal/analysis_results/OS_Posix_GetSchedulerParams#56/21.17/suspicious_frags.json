  "explanation": "No use of the string-handling functions that accept pointer parameters (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in this function. The only string-related call is strerror(errno) inside OS_DEBUG; strerror does not take or operate on caller-supplied buffers and therefore does not fall under the bound-access concern of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Additionally, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro in the provided context, so the debug-formatted calls are eliminated. All other operations are integer calls/assignments (sched_get_priority_max/min and PriLim->PriorityMin/Max arithmetic and casts) and do not involve <string.h> pointer-parameter string operations that could access out of bounds. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
