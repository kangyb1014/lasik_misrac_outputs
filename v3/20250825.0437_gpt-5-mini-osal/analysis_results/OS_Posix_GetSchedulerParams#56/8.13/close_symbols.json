  "explanation": "- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: need the struct definition to know the types of PriorityMin/PriorityMax and whether they are scalar members (writable). This determines if the PriLim pointer must be non-const (it is written) or whether members are pointers that might require const qualification.\n- sched_get_priority_max: prototype (return type and parameters) to confirm it does not use pointer parameters and to ensure no pointer constness issues arise from its signature.\n- sched_get_priority_min: same reason as sched_get_priority_max.\n- strerror: prototype/return type is required because it returns a char *; MISRA may consider this should be const char *. Knowing its declared type is necessary to judge if the code violates the \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" rule when passing the result to OS_DEBUG.\n- errno: declaration/type is required to confirm errno usage (it is an int) and that strerror(errno) is being passed correctly; also to check if any pointer-to-errno form/macro could affect constness analysis.\n- OS_DEBUG: macro or function prototype is needed to know the expected types of its parameters (e.g., whether it expects const char * for the format/strings). This affects whether passing strerror(...) (char *) to it is a const-correct operation.\n\nThese symbols capture all pointer-related declarations/returns used in the function (the output pointer PriLim, the string pointer from strerror, and the debug formatting interface) so the MISRA const-qualified-pointer rule can be evaluated accurately."
