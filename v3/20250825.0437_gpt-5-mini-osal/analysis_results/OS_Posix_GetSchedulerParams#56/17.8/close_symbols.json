  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we need the following symbol definitions because they can affect whether the formal parameters (sched_policy and PriLim) are modified directly or indirectly:\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: The typedef/struct definition is required to confirm the parameter type. If POSIX_PriorityLimits_t were itself a pointer type (e.g., typedef struct S *POSIX_PriorityLimits_t), then the parameter POSIX_PriorityLimits_t *PriLim would be a pointer-to-pointer and uses of \"PriLim->...\" could have different semantics. Knowing the exact object layout also verifies that assignments to PriLim->PriorityMin / PriorityMax modify the pointed-to object (allowed) and not the pointer itself (disallowed).\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro/function is invoked several times with expressions that reference the parameters. If OS_DEBUG is a macro that expands to code which assigns to or rebinds sched_policy or PriLim (or otherwise has side effects on them), that could constitute modification of a parameter. The exact definition is needed to rule that out.\n\n- sched_get_priority_max and sched_get_priority_min: Their prototypes/definitions are needed to confirm they accept sched_policy by value (not by pointer) and that they are not macros that expand into code which might modify the local parameter variable (sched_policy) or the PriLim pointer. If these were macros with side effects they might affect parameter-modification analysis.\n\n- strerror: Included because it is used in the OS_DEBUG calls; if strerror were an unusual macro that expanded to code affecting parameters, that could matter. (Unlikely, but include to be comprehensive.)\n\n- errno: The global used in strerror(errno) \u2014 include to ensure there are no macro redefinitions that could alias or modify the function parameters during its use in the logging calls.\n\nWith these symbols available the next analyzer can confirm whether any uses in the function (assignments, calls or macro expansions) modify the value of the parameter variables (sched_policy or the pointer PriLim itself). The visible code assigns only to the pointed-to fields (PriLim->PriorityMin / PriorityMax) and does not reassign sched_policy or PriLim; the listed symbols are needed to ensure no hidden macro/function side-effects change that conclusion."
