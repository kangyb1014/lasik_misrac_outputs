  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl(&token);",
    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only these two statements take the address of a non-const object (\"&token\") and thus involve passing a pointer that could be examined for const-qualification. There are no other pointer variables, pointer parameters, or pointer expressions in this function (the parameter var_id is not a pointer, token is an object not a pointer, and other statements are simple assignments/returns). Therefore no other fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 8.13."
