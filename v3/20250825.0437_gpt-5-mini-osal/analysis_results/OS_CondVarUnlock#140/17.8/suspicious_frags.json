  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function has a single parameter, var_id, which is passed by value and is never assigned to or otherwise modified within OS_CondVarUnlock (no assignments, increments, or use as an lvalue). The only addresses taken and pointers passed are of a local variable (token), not of any function parameter. Calls to OS_ObjectIdGetById and OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl pass var_id by value and &token (a local), respectively; passing a parameter by value does not modify the caller's parameter, and modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is not applicable here because this function has no pointer parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
