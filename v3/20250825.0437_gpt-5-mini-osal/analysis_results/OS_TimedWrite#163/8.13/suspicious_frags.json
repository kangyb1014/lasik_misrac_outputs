  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function either do not involve pointers (e.g. declarations of return_code, nbytes checks, return statements) or already use const-qualified pointer types where applicable (the function parameter declaration uses 'const void *buffer'). The only places that could affect compliance with Rule 8.13 are the uses of pointer parameters/arguments (the buffer check macro and the three calls passing &token or buffer). No other lines introduce pointer types that could be made const, so they do not need further investigation."
