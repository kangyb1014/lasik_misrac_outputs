  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token), scalar variables (int status) and return statements are not pointer declarations, and comments/macros without pointer-type declarations are irrelevant for this rule. The listed fragments encompass all places where pointer types are introduced or where addresses of object members are taken and therefore should be reviewed to determine whether the pointed-to types could be const-qualified."
