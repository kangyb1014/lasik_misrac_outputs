  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any string comparison appears in the provided function or the related symbol definitions. The function OS_CondVarWait_Impl only calls pthread APIs (pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cleanup_pop) and uses an OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET lookup; the provided supplementary symbols (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) contain no memcmp or char*/string comparisons. There are no null-terminated string variables or comparisons in the supplied code, and no occurrence of memcmp to inspect. Therefore there are no code fragments in the given code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
