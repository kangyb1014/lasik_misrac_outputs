  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists of straightforward, executed operations that are used in normal control flow: obtaining the implementation record (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)), declaring and using the local variables, checking the return status and returning OS_ERROR or OS_SUCCESS. Those statements are reachable, affect program behavior, and their removal would change the function semantics, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2. The selected fragments involve the pthread cleanup push/pop mechanism (and the cleanup handler implementation) and the pthread_cond_wait call \u2014 these interactions are subtle (cleanup handlers are not invoked during normal flow, pthread_cond_wait is a cancellation point, and pthread_cleanup_pop(false) suppresses immediate execution), and therefore warrant investigation to ensure they are not effectively dead (i.e., executed operations whose removal would not alter behavior) in the project context."
