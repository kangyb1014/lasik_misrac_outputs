  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is invariant. The only loop is: while (DataLen > 0) \u2014 its controlling expression depends on the parameter DataLen, which is modified inside the loop (DataLen -= WriteLen), so the condition is variant and must be evaluated each iteration. There are no do-while or for loops with constant/compile-time conditions, nor any infinite-loop constructs that would fall under the allowed exceptions. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
