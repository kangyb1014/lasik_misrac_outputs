  "explanation": "- OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the direct caller of OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl (per the static call graph). You must inspect its definition to see whether the call to OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is actually present and reachable (unconditional vs conditional, early returns, guarded by preprocessor, etc.).\n- OS_printf: Called inside OS_SymbolTableDump; logging calls can be adjacent to conditional logic or early returns. Examining it in context helps determine whether control flow reaches the call to OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl.\n- OS_TranslatePath: Its return/behaviour inside OS_SymbolTableDump may cause early returns or error paths that prevent the call to OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl; need to inspect for reachability.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit / OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: These transaction APIs in OS_SymbolTableDump may introduce control flow (error handling, early exits) that affect whether the Impl call is reachable.\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These unit-test/stub hooks appear in OS_SymbolTableDump\u2019s callees list. In some build/test configurations they may alter control flow or replace behavior so the call to OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl could be omitted or made unreachable; inspect their usage sites.\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The constant returned by OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is not required to decide reachability, but include it to confirm the function\u2019s observable behavior if it is reachable (helps overall analysis completeness).\n- relevant build/configuration preprocessor macros that enable/disable symbol-table functionality: Preprocessor guards or feature macros can remove or alter the call site (or the entire OS_SymbolTableDump/Impl definitions) at compile time. You must check these to determine true project-level reachability.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether the call site that invokes OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is actually reachable in the compiled project (and therefore whether the Impl function constitutes unreachable code under MISRA)."
