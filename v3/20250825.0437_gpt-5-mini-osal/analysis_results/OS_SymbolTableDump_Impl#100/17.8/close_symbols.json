  "explanation": "1) OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The function simply returns this symbol. To be certain the target function does not modify its parameters via macro expansion or side effects hidden in a macro/enum, the exact definition of OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED must be inspected. If it were a function-like macro or expression that referenced or assigned to the parameter names, that could violate the MISRA rule.  \n\n2) size_t (typedef from <stddef.h>): Verify that SizeLimit is a plain parameter of type size_t and that size_t is a typedef (not a macro or special construct). If size_t were unexpectedly defined as a macro or something that could expand into code that modifies parameters, it would affect the MISRA analysis. This confirms the parameter is a normal scalar parameter and cannot be modified implicitly by its type definition."
