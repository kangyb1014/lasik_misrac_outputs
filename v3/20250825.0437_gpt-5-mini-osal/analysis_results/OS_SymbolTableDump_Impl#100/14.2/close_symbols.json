The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",
  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The function body contains no for statements (only a comment and a simple return of OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED). MISRA C \"for loop well-formed\" requirements only apply if a for statement (or code expanded from a macro into a for statement) is present in the function. There are no callees or statements in this function that could contain a for loop; therefore there is nothing else to inspect to decide compliance.\n\nNote (optional): if you want absolute certainty that no for-loop is hidden via macro expansion, you could inspect the definition of OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED to confirm it is a plain integer constant/macromatically-defined integer and not a macro that expands into statements. That check is not required to determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule for the shown function, but if desired the single symbol to inspect would be OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED."
