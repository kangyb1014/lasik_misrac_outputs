  "explanation": "1) OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the caller shown in the static call graph. Inspecting its implementation is required to determine how the filename argument is provided (e.g. whether a mutable char * buffer is passed expecting modification, or a string literal/const pointer is passed). That caller context can show whether the impl must accept a non-const pointer or can safely use a const-qualified parameter. 2) Declaration/prototype of OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl (public header): The external/prototype declaration may differ from the implementation signature (const vs non-const). MISRA checks require consistency between prototype and definition; if the public prototype lacks const, that could be a violation or force the implementation signature to match. Reviewing the declared prototype ensures the effective API contract is evaluated for const-qualification compliance."
