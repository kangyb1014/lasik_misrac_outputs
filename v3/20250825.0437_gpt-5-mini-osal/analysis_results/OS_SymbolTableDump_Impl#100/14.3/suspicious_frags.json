  "explanation": "No control-flow constructs appear in the provided function body \u2014 there are no if, for, while, do-while, switch statements or conditional (?:) expressions whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The function contains only comments and a single return of a macro constant; returning a constant is not a \"controlling expression\" and therefore not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The provided macro definition and typedef are not control expressions either. Consequently, there are no fragments in this code that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
