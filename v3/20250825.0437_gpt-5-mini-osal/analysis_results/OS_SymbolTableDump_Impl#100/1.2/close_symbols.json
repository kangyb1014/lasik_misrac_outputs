  "explanation": "int32: The function return type is int32 (not a standard C identifier). You must inspect its typedef/definition to confirm it is a standard-conforming typedef (e.g. based on standard integer types) and not implemented using a compiler-specific extension (compiler-specific typedefs, builtin types, or __extension__ constructs).\n\nsize_t: The SizeLimit parameter uses size_t. Although size_t is a standard type, its definition can vary across environments; include its typedef/header to verify it is the standard definition and not replaced/aliased via compiler-specific macros or extensions.\n\nOS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The function returns this macro/enum. Its definition may involve casts, compiler-specific attributes, extension keywords (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, builtin constants) or nonstandard constructs. Inspecting this symbol is required to determine whether the function actually uses a language extension via the returned value."
