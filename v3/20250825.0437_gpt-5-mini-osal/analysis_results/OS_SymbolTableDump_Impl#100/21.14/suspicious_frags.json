  "explanation": "I examined the provided implementation of OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl and the related macro definition. The function body contains no calls to memcmp (or any other string/comparison functions), and there are no other code fragments or headers in the supplied snippets that perform string comparisons. The only related symbol is the numeric macro OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Therefore there are no occurrences of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings in the provided code to warrant investigation."
