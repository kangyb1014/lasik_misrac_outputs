This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- strlen: The code calls strlen(OutputLine). To check MISRA rule compliance we must know strlen's semantic: it reads bytes until a '\\0' and will access bytes beyond the object if no terminator is present. We need its prototype/behavior to determine whether the call could read past OutputLine when OutputLine might not be null-terminated.\n\n- snprintf: The first write into OutputLine uses snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), ...). To prove strlen is safe (and that no overflow occurs) we must know snprintf's truncation and null-termination guarantees (C99/C11 behavior: writes at most size-1 characters and always null-terminates when size>0). The exact semantics are required to reason about whether OutputLine will contain a terminating '\\0' and whether initial write can overflow.\n\n- sprintf: The loop uses sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", Byte_ptr[i]) to append bytes. sprintf has no bounds checking; we need its behavior (writes the formatted chars plus terminating '\\0') to reason about how many bytes are written each iteration, where the terminating null lands, and whether successive writes can write beyond OutputLine's 80 bytes.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: The function is called with OutputLine. To fully determine whether any string-handling access could run out of bounds (for example, if UT_BSP_DoText were to modify the buffer or expect a different termination), we need the UT_BSP_DoText prototype/contract (does it take const char * or char *, does it write into the buffer or only read it?). If it writes into the buffer it could affect safety of subsequent strlen/reads.\n\n- uint32 and uint8: The types of the loop indices and the byte pointer affect range analysis (maximum Length value, wrap/overflow behavior, and indexing into Byte_ptr). Definitions/widths are necessary to reason about index bounds and to ensure pointer arithmetic (Byte_ptr[i]) cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses used by string functions.\n\n- size_t: strlen and snprintf return/accept size_t; having the definition/width of size_t is needed to reason precisely about sizes, comparisons (i < Length), and conversions between uint32 and size_t to ensure no implicit narrowing or unexpected behavior that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nThese symbols (prototypes/semantics and type definitions) are the minimal additional information required to decide if any use of the string-handling function(s) (strlen specifically, and the writes done by snprintf/sprintf) can access memory beyond the bounds of the referenced objects in this function."
