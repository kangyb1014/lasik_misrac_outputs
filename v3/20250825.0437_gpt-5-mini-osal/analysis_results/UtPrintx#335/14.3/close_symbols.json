  "explanation": "To decide if the loop controlling expressions (while (i < Length) and for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; ...)) can be considered invariant, the analyzer must know whether the variables in those expressions (i, Length) can be changed outside the obvious increments in the body or whether called routines can change program flow. Each symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- uint32: determine the exact typedef/qualification for Length (is it plain, volatile, or an alias to some special type?). If Length were volatile or mapped to hardware, its value could change asynchronously and the controlling expression would not be invariant.\n\n- uint8: determine the typedef/qualification for the pointed-to data (Byte_ptr). This helps assess aliasing/qualification issues (e.g., if Memory/Byte_ptr aliases shared/volatile memory) that could affect loop behavior.\n\n- Memory (parameter qualifier): confirm the declaration (const/volatile) of the Memory parameter. If Memory or its pointee were volatile or otherwise tied to external state, that could affect loop termination reasoning (via aliasing or side effects observed in the loop).\n\n- snprintf, sprintf, strlen: these standard-library functions are called inside the loop body. The analyzer must confirm they do not modify i or Length (they are not passed their addresses) and whether their implementations invoke longjmp/abort/exit or other unusual control transfers or global side-effects that could affect loop control.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: this function is invoked at the end of each outer-loop iteration. Its prototype and implementation must be inspected to see whether it can modify program state that affects i or Length (via global state, aliasing, volatile access), or perform non-local control transfers (longjmp/exit/shutdown) or otherwise prevent the loop from progressing. If UT_BSP_DoText can reinitialize i, change Length, or block indefinitely, the controlling expression analysis changes.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText implementation callees (UT_BSP_Lock, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev): the static call graph shows UT_BSP_DoText calls these routines. The analyzer needs to inspect them (or at least UT_BSP_DoText\u2019s use of them) to determine whether any indirect side-effects or control transfers originate in those lower-level functions (for example, a shutdown that calls exit, or a console implementation that triggers longjmp), which would affect whether the loop\u2019s controlling expressions can be considered invariant."
