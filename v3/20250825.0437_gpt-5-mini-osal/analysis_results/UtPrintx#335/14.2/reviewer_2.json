First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtPrintx.\n```c\nvoid UtPrintx(const void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32       i;\n    uint32       j;\n    const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n    char         OutputLine[80];\n    char *       OutPtr;\n\n    i = 0;\n    while (i < Length)\n    {\n        snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), \"%16lx: \", (unsigned long)&Byte_ptr[i]);\n        OutPtr = OutputLine;\n        OutPtr += strlen(OutputLine);\n        for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; j++, i++)\n        {\n            sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", Byte_ptr[i]);\n            OutPtr += 3;\n        }\n\n        UT_BSP_DoText(UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO, OutputLine);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for statement 'for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; j++, i++)' violates Rule 14.2. It uses and modifies two counters (j and i): first clause initializes j, but the third clause modifies both j and i (more than one loop counter). The second clause uses i even though i is modified by the loop increment and is also modified outside the for (in the enclosing while), which breaches the restriction that the second clause shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body. Thus clauses 2, 3 and 4 of Rule 14.2 are violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtPrintx:\nuint32       i\n...\nuint32       j\n...\nuint32 Length\n...\nconst uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory\n...\nchar *       OutPtr\n...\nchar         OutputLine[80]\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for header 'for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; j++, i++)' uses and updates two distinct loop counters (j and i). That breaks MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2: specifically, the third clause modifies more than the single loop counter (violates clause 3) and there is more than one loop counter in the loop (violates clause 4). Additionally, the second clause refers to i even though i is functioning as a second loop counter (i is modified by the loop increment), which is not permitted\u2014so the second clause is also improper under the rule\u2019s restrictions on what the loop-condition may reference. In short, the for statement is not well-formed per Rule 14.2 and the agent A\u2019s report is correct."
