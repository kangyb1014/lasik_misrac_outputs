  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C unreachable-code in UtPrintx you must know whether any called symbol can fail to return or otherwise make parts of UtPrintx unreachable, and you must know the relevant prototypes/types used in control flow/expressions:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText (declaration and implementation): UtPrintx calls this at the end of each loop iteration. If UT_BSP_DoText is annotated noreturn or its implementation calls exit/longjmp/abort, subsequent code (the loop continuation or any code after the call) may be unreachable. You need the definition/attributes to determine reachability.\n\n- UT_BSP_Shutdown_Impl (declaration and implementation) and OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl (declaration and implementation): These appear in the UT_BSP_DoText call graph. If UT_BSP_DoText forwards to a shutdown routine that does not return, that makes code after the call unreachable; the shutdown implementations must be inspected for noreturn behaviour.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock (declaration and implementation): UT_BSP_DoText calls these. If they perform longjmp/terminate the program (or otherwise don't return), they can create unreachable code in UtPrintx. Include them to determine whether any path from UT_BSP_DoText is non-returning.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl (declaration and implementation): Called by UT_BSP_DoText; if it never returns (or raises a non-local exit), it affects reachability of UtPrintx.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO (macro/enum definition): This is an argument passed to UT_BSP_DoText. If it expands to something with side effects that affect control flow (unlikely but possible in some codebases), it could influence reachability; include to be safe.\n\n- snprintf, sprintf, strlen (prototypes/attributes): These standard library routines are called inside UtPrintx. You need their prototypes/attributes to confirm they are normal-returning functions (no noreturn attribute) and to check whether any of them might be macros or wrappers that could alter control flow (e.g., custom replacements that abort or longjmp). Also their return/value behavior is relevant to reasoning about buffer/format usage (though not directly to unreachable-code, it rules out hidden non-return behavior).\n\n- uint32 and uint8 typedefs: The integer types used for loop counters and indexing. Knowing their underlying types and ranges can be necessary to reason about the loop conditions (e.g., whether Length can be signed/unsigned, width-related wraparound) which affects whether certain branches/loop bodies are potentially unreachable under all valid values.\n\nCollecting the above symbols (declarations and implementations/attributes where applicable) allows the next analyst to determine if any call in the function is non-returning or if type/prototype issues make portions of the code impossible to reach, satisfying the requirements for MISRA C unreachable-code analysis."
