  "explanation": "Fragments not reported as suspicious and why:\n- The designated initializers used in the OS_SharedGlobalVars initializer (e.g. .GlobalState = 0, .PrintfEnabled = false, etc.) are standard C (C99 and later) features, not compiler extensions per se, so they do not automatically violate Rule 1.2.\n- The typedef of uint8 from uint8_t is a normal type alias, not a language extension.\n- The use of fixed-width integer types (uint8_t) and the hex literal (0xABADC0DE) are standard C constructs.\n- The use of preprocessor conditional compilation (#if defined(...)) and NULL are standard preprocessor/library features, not language extensions.\n- Calls to OS/platform APIs (kill, getpid) and use of signals (SIGHUP) are platform/library usages (POSIX), not compiler language extensions.\n- The comparison against true (if (flag == true)) is a normal expression (assuming stdbool.h or equivalent boolean definitions are in scope) and not a compiler extension.\n\nReason to investigate the reported fragments:\n- The call to OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() appears before any visible prototype/declaration in the provided snippets. Relying on an implicit function declaration (calling a function without a prior prototype in scope) is something many compilers accept only as a language extension (it was removed from the C standard in C99). Therefore the call site and the later definition are provided so reviewers can verify whether a proper prototype is present in the translation unit or included headers; if not, this is a use of a language extension and should be addressed."
