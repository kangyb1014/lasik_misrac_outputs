  "explanation": "No parameter is modified in this function. Examination of each parameter:\n- FuncKey (UT_EntryKey_t): only passed as an argument to other functions and not assigned to or altered within UT_ExecuteBasicHandler.\n- FunctionName (const char *): only passed to UT_DefaultStubImpl and never reassigned; the pointer itself is not modified. The const qualifier also prevents modification of the pointed-to object in this scope.\n- DefaultHandler (UT_HandlerFunc_t): only tested for NULL and passed to UT_SetHandlerFunction; it is not assigned to or altered. \nCalls that pass these parameters to other functions do not constitute modification of the parameters in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
