  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of language compiler extensions in the provided code that would need to be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n\n- The OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID definition ((osal_key_t){0}) is a compound literal, which is a standard C99 language feature (not a compiler extension). It is not an extension unless the chosen compiler explicitly documents compound literals as an extension; no such compiler-specific extension is present in the code.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop, pthread_cond_timedwait, struct timespec and related constructs are POSIX threading APIs and types, not compiler language extensions. They are library/OS-level APIs rather than language extensions introduced by a specific compiler.\n\n- The comment directive /* cppcheck-suppress redundantAssignment */ is a static-analysis tool directive and not a language extension.\n\n- Types such as uint32 (typedef of uint32_t) and osal_key_t are standard typedefs built on stdint.h-style integer types; using these is standard C.\n\n- There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }) used as expressions, nested functions, asm inline, label-as-values, or other vendor-specific tokens.\n\nIf you are targeting a compiler that does not support C99 (or later) and that compiler's documentation explicitly lists compound literals or any other construct above as a nonstandard extension, then that particular construct should be re-examined. Absent such compiler-specific documentation, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
