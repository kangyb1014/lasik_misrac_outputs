  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of all referenced types, macros, globals and called functions because extensions are commonly introduced there (attributes, asm, compiler-specific storage-class or type keywords, anonymous/unnamed constructs, etc.).\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The token type definition must be checked for any non-standard language features (anonymous/unnamed structs or unions, bit-field usage with implementation-defined widths, compiler attributes on members, or other extensions).\n- uint32: This typedef (or macro) needs inspection to ensure it is a standard integer typedef and not a compiler-specific extension type (e.g., __int128, or typedefs using attributes or unusual keywords).\n- osal_key_t: The underlying type (and any attributes) for the key must be checked for extensions (packed/aligned/attribute annotations or nonstandard storage-class specifiers).\n- OS_objtype_state_t: The object-state struct definition must be reviewed for anonymous unions/structs, flexible array members, bit-fields or attribute annotations (all potential language extensions).\n- OS_objtype_state: The global array/variable declaration (whose address is taken and indexed) must be checked for any linkage or declaration-level extensions (e.g., section attributes, asm labels, visibility attributes, unusual storage qualifiers).\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The macro/constant definition must be inspected to ensure it does not use compiler extensions (statement expressions, typeof, GCC-specific constructs, or attributes).\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The prototype/definition of the called implementation must be checked for function-level extensions (calling-convention attributes, inline asm, __attribute__ annotations, or other compiler-specific keywords).\n\nChecking these symbols (their headers/definitions) lets the next analyzer determine whether any of the constructs used by the target function rely on language extensions."
