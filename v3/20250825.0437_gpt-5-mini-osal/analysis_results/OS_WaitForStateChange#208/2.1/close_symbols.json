  "explanation": "OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The key symbol. If this function is declared/annotated as non-returning (e.g. noreturn/__attribute__((noreturn))) or expands to an infinite loop/abort, the code after the call (restoring owner_key) would be unreachable. The prototype and attributes are required to determine reachability. OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: Could be defined as something that does not return (unlikely but possible as a macro/function-like expansion). Its definition is needed to ensure the assignment objtype->owner_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID does not itself render following code unreachable. OS_object_token_t: The struct definition is needed to know the type and semantics of token->obj_type (e.g. if token is a sentinel value or the field has special semantics) which can affect whether the array indexing or subsequent statements are conditionally reachable. OS_objtype_state: The global array/variable used in &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] \u2014 its declaration (size, linkage) is needed to confirm that the indexing expression is well-formed and does not rely on compile-time constants or macros that could make parts of the function unreachable. OS_objtype_state_t: The type of the array elements is required to confirm presence and type of owner_key member and to detect any overloaded semantics or member attributes that could affect control flow (e.g. volatile, accessors, or macros). osal_key_t: The type of saved_unlock_key/owner_key \u2014 required to understand whether assigning/restoring the key could invoke non-returning behavior (via overloaded macros, special setters), or be removed/optimized in ways that affect reachability. Together these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any statement in OS_WaitForStateChange can never be reached (MISRA unreachable-code)."
