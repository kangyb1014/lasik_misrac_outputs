  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: pthread_cleanup_push is a macro that must be paired with pthread_cleanup_pop and in the shown code it is correctly paired with pthread_cleanup_pop(false). The push/pop pair only registers a cleanup handler and does not make the intervening code unreachable. (If the pop were missing or the macros were incorrectly defined so a block never closed, that could cause problems, but that is not the case here.)"
