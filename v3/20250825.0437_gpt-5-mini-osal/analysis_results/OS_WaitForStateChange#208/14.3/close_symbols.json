  "explanation": "OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The target calls this implementation function. Although the MISRA rule asks about controlling expressions inside the target function, a called implementation may contain loop/conditional constructs that are effectively part of the wait behavior. To be sure no invariant controlling expressions relevant to the wait are being introduced via the call, the implementation body must be inspected.\n\nOS_object_token_t: The token parameter type definition is required to determine the type and semantics of the obj_type member (e.g. whether it is an enum, constant, or computed value). Knowing obj_type's type ensures that indexing into the OS_objtype_state array is not an invariant controlling expression (or expanded macro that contains control flow).\n\nOS_objtype_state: The global array (or variable) indexed by token->obj_type is directly used in the function (OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]). Its declaration is needed to confirm that the indexing expression is not a macro or accessor that introduces control flow, and to verify that the access does not depend on an invariant expression.\n\nOS_objtype_state_t: The element type definition is required to see the owner_key member type and any accessors or side effects associated with reading/writing that member (e.g. if owner_key is implemented via macro or inline function that contains control flow). This ensures assignments to owner_key are simple data operations, not hidden control constructs.\n\nosal_key_t: The type of owner_key must be known to ensure that assignments and comparisons involving owner_key (including assigning OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID) are not implemented via macros or inline functions that contain controlling expressions.\n\nOS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The macro/constant value assigned to owner_key must be inspected to ensure it is a simple constant and not defined in a way that expands to control flow or an invariant controlling expression. If it expands to an expression containing control statements, that could affect a MISRA-controlled expression analysis.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no explicit controlling statements (if, while, for, do-while). The above symbols are the minimal set needed to confirm that none of the referenced types, macros, array accesses or the called implementation implicitly introduce invariant controlling expressions that would cause a MISRA C violation."
