  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for out-of-bounds string.h use:\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl\n  - The target function calls this implementation routine. Any violation of the string-handling bounds rule could occur inside this callee. You must inspect its prototype and body to see if it calls memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc., and how it uses its parameters (obj_type and attempts) to size those operations.\n\n- OS_objtype_state\n  - The code indexes this global array with token->obj_type and then reads/writes fields (owner_key). To ensure no string APIs are later passed pointers that reference beyond an object, you need the actual global object/array instance (memory layout) and to confirm the index is valid.\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t\n  - The struct definition reveals members (including any char arrays or pointers) that could be targets or sources for string functions. You need member types and sizes to determine whether any string/memory operations would be in-bounds.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The token type definition (fields and their types) is required to know what token->obj_type is (type, semantics) and whether other token fields could be passed to string functions. It also shows whether obj_type is signed/unsigned and its valid range.\n\n- osal_key_t\n  - The owner_key field is of this type. Knowing its typedef ensures the assign/restore operations are type-correct and not aliasing some pointer/array that might interact with string APIs.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID\n  - The value assigned to owner_key while waiting; you must confirm it is not a pointer or alias to memory that string functions might use, and that writing this value does not corrupt adjacent memory (depends on owner_key size/type).\n\n- (array length) OS_objtype_state array size macro (e.g. OS_MAX_API_OBJECT_TYPES)\n  - To prove the indexing objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] is in-bounds you need the compile-time size/limit of the OS_objtype_state array (the macro/constant defining the number of object types). This also limits which objtype entries can be referenced and whether any subsequent accesses into objtype members are safe.\n\nIn short: inspect the callee implementation (OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl) for string.h usage, and inspect the types and globals used to form pointers/indices (OS_object_token_t, OS_objtype_state, OS_objtype_state_t, osal_key_t, OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID and the array size) to determine whether any string/memory operations could access beyond object bounds."
