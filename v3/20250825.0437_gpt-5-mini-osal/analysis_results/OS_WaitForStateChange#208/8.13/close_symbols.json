  "explanation": "- OS_object_token_t: Needed to see the exact fields and their types (in particular obj_type) and to determine whether the function mutates any part of *token. If token is only read, it could be declared as const OS_object_token_t *token.\n- OS_objtype_state_t: Required to inspect the member types (owner_key) and whether members are intended mutable. This determines whether the pointer objtype must be non-const because its contents are modified.\n- OS_objtype_state (the global array/object indexed by token->obj_type): Necessary to know how the table is declared (e.g., const or non-const storage). If the table is declared const, taking a non-const pointer to its elements would violate const-correctness.\n- osal_key_t: The typedef of owner_key/saved_unlock_key is needed to verify semantics of the assignment to objtype->owner_key and whether any const/volatile qualifiers exist that affect pointer qualification decisions.\n- uint32: The integer typedef of attempts is needed to be sure there are no hidden pointer typedefs or qualifiers; it is small but included to fully resolve parameter types for const-qualification analysis.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The macro/constant value written into objtype->owner_key must be known to confirm it is not a pointer or const-qualified object that would affect whether objtype must be non-const.\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: Its prototype confirms what is passed/modified by the implementation layer (even though token itself is not passed, this helps ensure there are no indirect modifications via global state expectations that would affect const qualification decisions)."
