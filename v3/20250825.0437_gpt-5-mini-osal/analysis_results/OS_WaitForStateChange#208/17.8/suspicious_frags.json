  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying a function parameter itself (reassigning the pointer parameter). In OS_WaitForStateChange the token parameter is only read (token->obj_type) and never reassigned or otherwise modified. The code does modify objtype->owner_key, but objtype is a pointer to an entry in the global OS_objtype_state[] table (derived from token->obj_type) \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule. saved_unlock_key is a struct copy, and the later restore simply writes that saved value back into the table. OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl is invoked with token->obj_type (an integer/enum), not the token pointer, so it cannot modify the parameter. There are no pointer casts, pointer arithmetic, or assignments to token itself in the provided code. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and no additional fragments need investigation under this rule."
