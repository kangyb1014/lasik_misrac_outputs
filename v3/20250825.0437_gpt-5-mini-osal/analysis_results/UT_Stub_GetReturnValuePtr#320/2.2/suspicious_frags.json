  "explanation": "I have reported code fragments that are potentially relevant to a dead-code (Rule 2.2) investigation. These include initializations and error/abort paths whose runtime behavior (whether they return or not) or usage may make prior assignments or follow-up code effectively dead in practice; the hash/index computation, bounded-search setup, the search loop and the code that updates the global search-length bound, and the UtAssert_Abort implementation which may or may not terminate execution. Any of these can influence whether earlier assignments are actually used or whether some executed statements have no effect on program behaviour, so they should be inspected.\n\nWhy other fragments were not reported: routine/essential items such as the function signature, the final \"return ReturnPtr;\" statement, local variable declarations, comment text, the UtAssert_Failed macro expansion reference, and type/structure definitions are not themselves suspicious for dead code in this context \u2014 they are necessary parts of the function logic or definitions and their removal would clearly affect behaviour or are non-executable (comments). Similarly, normal comparisons, assignments that are clearly used on all control flow paths (other than the initialization mentioned above), and the strcmp/position comparison within the sanity-check were not isolated separately because they form part of the error-check logic already reported. If further detail is desired, I can expand or split any of the reported fragments into finer-grained pieces for more targeted review."
