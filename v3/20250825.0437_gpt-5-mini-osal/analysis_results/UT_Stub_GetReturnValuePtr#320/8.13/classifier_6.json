  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The function parameter TypeName is declared as const char * in UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr, so the pointer is already const-qualified. The fragment only uses the pointers (passing them to a varargs assertion function) and does not show any pointer declarations that drop const. (If StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr were declared without const, that would be a declaration-site issue \u2014 not visible in this fragment \u2014 and could violate the spirit of Rule 8.13.)"
