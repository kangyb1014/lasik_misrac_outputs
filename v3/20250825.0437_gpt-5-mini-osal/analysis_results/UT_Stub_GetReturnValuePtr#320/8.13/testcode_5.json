  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local pointer StubPtr is declared as UT_StubTableEntry_t * and is only used for read-only access (reading BasePtr, Position, ContentTypeStr) after assigning it from UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey,...). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr). Because StubPtr is not const-qualified despite only being read, this fragment violates Rule 8.13. (If the design requires modifying the pointed object via StubPtr, then non-const is justified.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/3203.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr:\n```c\nvoid *UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, size_t ReturnSize, const char *TypeName)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    void *               ReturnPtr;\n\n    ReturnPtr = NULL;\n    StubPtr   = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETURN_BUFFER);\n\n    if (StubPtr == NULL)\n    {\n        /* This shouldn't happen, it means the stub tried to use a\n         * return buffer that does not exist.\n         *\n         * It is most likely caused by a mismatch/incompatibility between\n         * stub and handler.
