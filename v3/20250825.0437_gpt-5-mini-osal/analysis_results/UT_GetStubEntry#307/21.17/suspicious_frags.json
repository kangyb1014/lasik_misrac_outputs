  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) that could access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. The provided function UT_GetStubEntry and the related definitions contain no calls to any of the standard string handling functions listed by the rule (no memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn or aliases thereof). Therefore there are no code fragments in this submission that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and nothing requiring investigation under that rule.\n\nAdditionally, the array indexing of UT_StubTable is guarded: Idx is computed as FuncKey % (UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS - 1) (yielding 0..UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS-2), is incremented and wrapped to 0 when Idx >= UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS, and the loop bounds are constrained by SearchLimit/SearchLen; thus there are no unbounded raw pointer/index operations that interact with string.h functions. Given these facts, no fragments need to be reported for inspection under Rule 21.17."
