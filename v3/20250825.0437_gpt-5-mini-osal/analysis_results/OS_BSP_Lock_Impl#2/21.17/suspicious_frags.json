  "explanation": "No invocations of the string.h functions that accept pointer parameters (the functions explicitly noted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code. The only string-related function call is strerror(status) inside the BSP_DEBUG call; strerror takes an integer and returns a pointer to an implementation-managed message string (it does not accept a user-supplied buffer pointer that could be accessed out of bounds), so it is not relevant to Rule 21.17. The OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl function uses the POSIX write() system call and pointer arithmetic on Str/ DataLen \u2014 these are not string.h library calls covered by Rule 21.17. The BSP_DEBUG macro expands to nothing, and the pthread_* calls do not use string.h functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in the given snippets that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
