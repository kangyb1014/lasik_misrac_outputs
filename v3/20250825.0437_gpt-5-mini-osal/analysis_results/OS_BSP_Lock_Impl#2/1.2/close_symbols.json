  "explanation": "For checking whether OS_BSP_Lock_Impl uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of the macros, globals and library symbols it relies on (a use of an extension could be hidden in a macro or in a type declaration). Required symbols and why:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG\n  - BSP_DEBUG is a macro (or function) used for logging in the error path. Macros frequently hide compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, inline asm, attributes, variadic macro extensions, etc.). You must see its definition to determine if an extension is used.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - The global object holding AccessMutex and AccessCancelState may itself be declared with compiler-specific extensions (attributes, section pragmas, packed/unaligned annotations, GCC extensions). Inspecting its declaration is necessary.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex\n  - The member type and its declaration (e.g. typedefs, attributes) could use extensions. You must see the exact member declaration to judge compliance.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState\n  - Same reason as above: the member declaration or surrounding declarations/macros may incorporate language extensions.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - This POSIX API is typically a normal function, but some platforms implement or wrap pthread calls with macros or inline wrappers that could use compiler extensions. Check its declaration/definition on the target platform.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate\n  - As with pthread_mutex_lock, this API might be a wrapper or macro; inspect its declaration for extensions.\n\n- strerror\n  - strerror can be implemented as a macro or wrapper on some libc implementations; that definition must be checked for use of extensions.\n\n- PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE\n  - This macro/constant must be inspected; if it is defined via non-standard constructs or macros that use extensions, it would affect compliance.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  - The underlying type of AccessMutex may be a typedef hiding implementation-defined or compiler-specific constructs (e.g. inline assembly, attributes). Inspecting the typedef helps detect extensions.\n\n- pthread.h and string.h (headers)\n  - The header files where the pthread and strerror APIs and related macros/types are declared should be checked to find any macro definitions or implementation details that use language extensions.\n\nThese symbols collectively let the analyser open the macro and type definitions and any wrapper implementations to determine whether OS_BSP_Lock_Impl or anything it directly uses relies on language/compiler extensions."
