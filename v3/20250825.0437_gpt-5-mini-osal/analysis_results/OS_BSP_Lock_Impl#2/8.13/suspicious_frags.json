  "explanation": "All other code fragments in the provided function do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. Specifically: the local variable 'status' is a plain int (not a pointer); the function signature 'void OS_BSP_Lock_Impl(void)' contains no pointer parameters; the comment block and control flow (if/else) contain no pointer usages; and the BSP_DEBUG macro definition as provided is an empty variadic macro definition and does not itself introduce pointer types. The listed fragments cover all occurrences in the snippet where an address-of operator is used or where a pointer-returning function is invoked, so they are the relevant places to inspect for potential missing const qualifications."
