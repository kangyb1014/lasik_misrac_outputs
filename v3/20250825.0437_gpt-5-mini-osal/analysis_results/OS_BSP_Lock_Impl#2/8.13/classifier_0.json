  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: pthread_mutex_lock has prototype int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) and modifies the mutex state, so the pointer must point to a non-const pthread_mutex_t. Passing &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex is appropriate. A violation would occur if the function being called did not modify the pointed-to object but the parameter type was non-const (i.e. the function should have accepted a pointer-to-const instead), or if an object that is never modified were unnecessarily passed through a non-const pointer."
