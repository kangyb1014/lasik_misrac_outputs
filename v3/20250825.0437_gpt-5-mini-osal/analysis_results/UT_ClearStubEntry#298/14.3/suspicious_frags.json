  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 were found. The only controlling expression is the if-condition: (StubPtr->EntryType == UT_ENTRYTYPE_DATA_BUFFER || StubPtr->EntryType == UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETURN_BUFFER) && StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr != NULL && (StubPtr->ModeFlags & UT_MODEFLAG_ALLOC_BUF) != 0. Each sub-expression depends on runtime values stored in the StubPtr structure (EntryType, Data.Buff.BasePtr, ModeFlags) and therefore is not an invariant. The UT_MODEFLAG_ALLOC_BUF macro is a constant mask, but combined with the variable ModeFlags via bitwise AND yields a non-constant result at runtime. There are no loops in the function (so the do-while/infinite-loop exceptions are not applicable). Other statements (free, memset) are not controlling expressions and thus not relevant to Rule 14.3. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for invariant controlling expressions under Rule 14.3."
