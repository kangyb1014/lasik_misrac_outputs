  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameter StubPtr itself (there is no assignment to StubPtr or any operation that changes the value of the pointer parameter). All modifications are to the object pointed to by StubPtr: the call to free(StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr) releases memory pointed to by a member, and memset(StubPtr, 0, sizeof(*StubPtr)) zeroes the structure object referenced by the parameter. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified; only modifying the pointer parameter value would violate the rule. The conditional checks (StubPtr->EntryType, StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr, StubPtr->ModeFlags) merely read members and do not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
