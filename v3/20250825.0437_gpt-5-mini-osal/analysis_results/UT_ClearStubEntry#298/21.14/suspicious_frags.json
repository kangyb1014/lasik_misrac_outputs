  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided UT_ClearStubEntry function contains no call to memcmp (nor to other string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp). It only calls free() and memset(), and the conditional logic tests entry-type and flags, not string contents. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that trigger Rule 21.14 and nothing here needs further investigation for that rule. (If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the codebase, those locations should be examined separately.)"
