  "explanation": "The MISRA rule targets pointer declarations and uses that should point to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified. The parameter token is already declared as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token) and therefore does not need investigation. The local integer variables (return_code, how, Mode) and the Mode/SHUT_* branch logic do not involve pointers and are not relevant to Rule 8.13. The return statements likewise do not involve pointer types. The only pointer usage in this function is the local conn_impl: its declaration, the assignment from the object-table macro, and subsequent read access of its member (conn_impl->fd) are the relevant locations where a pointer-to-const might be appropriate and thus should be investigated. No other pointer-containing fragments exist in this function that would be subject to this rule."
