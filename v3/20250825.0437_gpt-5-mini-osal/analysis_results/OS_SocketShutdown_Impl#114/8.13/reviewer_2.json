According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, e.g. const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl. Therefore this fragment violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In this function conn_impl is only used to read conn_impl->fd and is never used to modify the underlying object, so it can and should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl). Converting the pointer returned by the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro (a non-const pointer) to a pointer-to-const is allowed without a cast, so there is no technical impediment here. Therefore the current non-const declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 unless a documented rationale/justification exists."
