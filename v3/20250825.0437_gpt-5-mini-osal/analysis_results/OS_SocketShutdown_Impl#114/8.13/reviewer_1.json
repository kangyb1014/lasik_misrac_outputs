According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl). Therefore the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_SocketShutdown_Impl the local variable conn_impl is only used to read the fd member (conn_impl->fd) and the object is not modified via this pointer. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so conn_impl should be declared as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (which likely yields a pointer to a non-const record) to a pointer-to-const is allowed and would not change semantics. The only caveats would be if the macro or other uses require a mutable pointer (or if the pointer is later used to modify the object), in which case const would not be possible; none of that occurs in the shown code. Therefore the reported violation is valid."
