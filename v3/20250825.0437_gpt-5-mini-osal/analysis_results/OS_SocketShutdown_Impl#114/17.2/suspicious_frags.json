  "explanation": "I selected the above fragments because Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls) requires inspecting call sites and the functions they invoke to determine whether any call chain leads back to the same function. The OS_SocketShutdown function calls OS_SocketShutdown_Impl, and both functions reference/invoke other routines/macros (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET). Any of those could (directly or indirectly) call back into OS_SocketShutdown or OS_SocketShutdown_Impl, producing indirect recursion; therefore these call sites and their targets should be investigated.\n\nFragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they contain only local data handling, simple conditionals, or state updates that do not perform function calls that could form a recursion cycle (for example, the Mode validation logic, the stream state bit manipulations, and the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken definition are local and do not call other functions). The POSIX shutdown() call in the Impl function is a well-known library call and is not expected to call back into the OS layer; however, its invocation site is included above only for completeness of the Impl function context. To fully rule out indirect recursion, inspect the implementations of OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (macro/inline), and any functions they call to ensure none call back into OS_SocketShutdown or OS_SocketShutdown_Impl."
