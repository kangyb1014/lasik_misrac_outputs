  "explanation": "I reviewed OS_SocketShutdown_Impl and the related definitions/caller. The fragments above are the locations where the validity/possible values of the Mode parameter affect control flow and therefore could cause unreachable branches (or conceal unreachable assumptions) and should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n\nWhy other code fragments are not flagged:\n- The retrieval of conn_impl via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the subsequent shutdown(conn_impl->fd, how) call are normal, directly reachable operations given a valid token; there is no compile-time or logic reason in the shown code that makes those statements unreachable.\n- The assignments of return_code (OS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR) based on the return of shutdown() are reachable depending on runtime return values and are not dead code.\n- The OS_ObjectIdGetById/OS_ObjectIdRelease usage and the surrounding checks for socket_domain, socket_type, and stream_state are runtime conditional logic that can be taken or not depending on inputs/results; they are not statically unreachable from the provided code.\n- There are no obvious unreachable constructs such as statements after a return, infinite loops without exit, or disabled conditional compilation blocks in the supplied code.\n\nThe selected fragments concentrate on the Mode validation/usage (enum definition, caller BUGCHECK, impl branching, and bitwise checks after the impl call) because these are the places where values may be constrained by the caller (or by BUGCHECK semantics) and could render some branches unreachable or inconsistent; they therefore warrant investigation to ensure no unreachable code exists."
