  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The pointer parameter token is declared as const OS_object_token_t *; it is not assigned to or modified anywhere in the function. The only use is dereferencing (*token) to obtain an index/value for OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, which is a read-only use and does not modify the pointer itself.\n- The non-pointer parameter Mode is only read in conditional comparisons (Mode == ...); there are no assignments, increments/decrements, or other modifications to Mode.\n- All assignments (conn_impl, how, return_code) are to local variables, which is permitted. The call to shutdown(conn_impl->fd, how) uses conn_impl->fd and how but does not modify the function parameters.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is invoked with *token (the value), not token; thus it cannot reassign the pointer parameter. Additionally, token being const prevents accidental modification of the pointed-to object via this parameter.\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in the provided function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
