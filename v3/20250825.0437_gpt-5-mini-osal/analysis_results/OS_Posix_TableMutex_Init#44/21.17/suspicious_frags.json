  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions that take pointer parameters (the kinds of functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17) are present in this function. The code only calls pthread APIs (pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutexattr_settype, pthread_mutex_init, pthread_cond_init) and uses OS_DEBUG with strerror(ret).\n\nReasons other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 21.17:\n- There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or similar pointer-parameter string handling functions anywhere in the function.\n- The pthread_* calls do not belong to <string.h> and do not take pointer parameters that would be subject to this rule.\n- strerror(ret) takes an int (error number) and returns a pointer to an error message; it does not accept a pointer parameter that could cause an out-of-bounds access via its arguments. Passing the returned pointer to OS_DEBUG (as a %s argument) reads the message string provided by strerror, but that is not an invocation of a string.h function with a caller-supplied pointer parameter and therefore is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 as stated.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
