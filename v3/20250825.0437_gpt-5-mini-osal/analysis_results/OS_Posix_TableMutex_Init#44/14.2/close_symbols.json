The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For determining whether OS_Posix_TableMutex_Init violates the MISRA C \"for loop well-formed\" rule you must ensure there are no for-loops introduced by macro expansion or by called functions that are executed as part of this function. Each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: the global/object accessed by indexing (impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]); if this is a macro or has side-effecting accessors it could expand to a for loop or other control flow.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: definition of the struct pointed to by impl; its members (names/types) may be macros or inline-accessors that could contain for loops or modify loop counters.\n- osal_objtype_t: type of the index used to access OS_impl_objtype_lock_table; if this is a type with unusual semantics (macro, enum with side effects) it must be checked.\n- OS_DEBUG: typically a macro; must be inspected because macro expansion in-place could contain loops (for, while) or modify objects that would affect any hypothetical for-loop analysis.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init / pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol / pthread_mutexattr_settype / pthread_mutex_init / pthread_cond_init: these identifiers may be macros, inline functions, or wrappers; their definitions must be checked to ensure they do not themselves contain for loops or modify objects in a way that would interact with a for-loop in this function if one existed (MISRA requires considering called functions' behaviour when reasoning about for loops).\n- pthread_mutexattr_t / pthread_mutex_t / pthread_cond_t: types used as local or struct members; if these are macros or typedefs to structures with inline initializers/macros they could hide control flow\u2014need to confirm they are plain types.\n- strerror: could be a macro or wrapper that expands to code containing control flow; examine to rule out hidden for loops or side effects.\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT / PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL: macros/constants used as arguments; confirm they are simple constants (not macros that expand to expressions containing loops or assignments).\n- OS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR: return-code macros/constants used by the function; check they are simple constants and that any macros involved do not hide control flow or side effects.\n\nIn short: inspect any macro/inline/function definitions reachable from this function (the global table access, debug/log macros, and all called symbols and types) to ensure no for loops are introduced via expansion or called behaviour. If all of the above are simple declarations/constants/functions without embedded for loops, then OS_Posix_TableMutex_Init itself contains no for statement and does not violate the MISRA for-loop well-formed rule."
