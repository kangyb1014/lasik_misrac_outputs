Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were considered not suspicious for MISRA C Rule 2.2 (dead code) for the following reasons: wrappers that simply forward calls (e.g. OS_ObjectIdGetByName returning OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch) are small API shims whose removal would change API surface or call sites and therefore are not dead; simple typedefs and return statements (e.g. typedef uint32 osal_id_t, return return_code;) are syntactic/required elements, not dead code; simple single-call functions that implement a necessary lifecycle operation (e.g. OS_ObjectIdRelease calling OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish) perform required side-effects and cannot be removed without changing behavior. Also any lines that perform pointer/argument validation via macros were included where they could contradict downstream behavior; other uses of those macros that are clearly functional (not redundant) were not included. The fragments selected above represent places where either contradictory comments and checks exist, conditional branches that are likely never taken or guarded by feature macros, or assignments/releases that may be bypassed \u2014 these should be investigated to determine whether they are effectively dead in typical builds or configurations."
