  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definitions with typed parameters, standard typedefs (int32_t-based), variadic functions with va_list/va_start/va_end and vsnprintf (all standard), macros and constant-sized buffers. Common extension markers such as GCC/Clang attributes (__attribute__), inline assembler (__asm__), statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __builtin_* intrinsics, nested functions, labels-as-values, or other compiler-specific tokens do not appear in the shown code.\n\nNotes on items examined but not reported:\n- Macros such as OS_CHECK_POINTER, BUGCHECK, BUGCHECK_VOID, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, and OS_ObjectIdGetByName/OS_ConsoleWrite call sites could potentially expand to compiler-specific extensions, but their definitions are not provided here (only some macro uses were shown). Per the rule guidance you requested, I report only explicit uses of language extensions visible in the source. Since the macro expansions are not shown, they cannot be flagged as using extensions based on the provided text.\n- The typedefs (e.g., osal_id_t based on uint32, and int32 based on int32_t) are ordinary typedefs; the names themselves are not compiler extensions.\n- Use of ellipsis (...) in the OS_printf prototype/definition denotes a standard C variadic function, not a compiler extension.\n\nIf you can provide the actual definitions/expansions of the macros (BUGCHECK, BUGCHECK_VOID, OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK) or any compiler-specific header contents, I can re-evaluate those expansions for hidden compiler extensions. Based on the code shown, there are no visible language-extension usages to report."
