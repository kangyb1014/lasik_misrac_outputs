  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 applies to the standard string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). In this function there are exactly two calls to memset which therefore must be investigated for potential out-of-bounds access. Other calls in the code (sigemptyset, sigaddset, sigismember, sigtimedwait, timer_create, pthread_cancel, sysconf, clock_gettime, etc.) are not functions from <string.h> and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17; no other string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code fragment."
