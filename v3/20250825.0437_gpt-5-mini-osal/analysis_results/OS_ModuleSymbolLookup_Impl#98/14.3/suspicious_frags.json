  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found in the provided code. Details:\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: contains no control statements (no if/for/while/switch/do); it only computes an index with the macro and calls OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, so there is no controlling expression to be invariant.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET / OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: the macro expands to an array indexing using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)). This is not a controlling expression; it is an index computation based on token->obj_idx which is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: the conditionals are if (dlError != NULL) and else if (Function == NULL). Both depend on runtime results of dlerror() and dlsym(), so they are not invariant. There are no loops with constant conditions or do-while constructs here that evaluate to a constant boolean.\n\n- No other control constructs (for, while, do-while, switch) with constant or invariant expressions are present in the supplied code fragments. Therefore there are no code fragments needing investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
