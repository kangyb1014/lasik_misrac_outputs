  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments were not selected because they perform operations that clearly affect program behaviour or control flow and therefore are unlikely to be dead code: - The call to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(...) and the retrieval of the module table entry (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) obtain runtime data (dl handles) and invoke platform symbol lookup; removing these would change observable behaviour. - Initialization of status (status = OS_ERROR;) and the assignment status = OS_SUCCESS in the success branch determine the function return value; removing these would alter behavior. - The calls to dlerror() and dlsym() perform platform library interactions whose side effects (clearing and reading the dynamic linker error state, performing symbol resolution) are essential; they are not dead. - The iterator logic in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and the calls to OS_ObjectIdIterateActive/OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext/OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy implement iteration over runtime objects; these have runtime effects (control flow, timing) and are not dead. - The parameter checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and object lookup/release calls (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease) perform validation and resource management; removing them would change program semantics. - Variable declarations and usage (e.g. record, staticsym_status, local_status) participate in control decisions or are passed to other functions; they are not removable without changing behaviour. Therefore these parts do not appear to be dead code and do not need further investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2 based on the provided fragments."
