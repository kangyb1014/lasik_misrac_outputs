SymbolName is already const and SymbolAddress must be non-const because it is written to. Thus the lack of const on dl_handle constitutes a Rule 8.13 violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef uintptr_t cpuaddr\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 8.13 recommends adding const when a pointer does not modify the pointed-to object, but in this case the dl_handle is an opaque handle that is passed directly to the POSIX dlsym API, whose prototype takes void * (non-const). Making dl_handle a const void * would be incompatible with dlsym without introducing a cast that discards const, which is not a clean improvement and would itself raise other MISRA concerns. SymbolName is already const and SymbolAddress must be non-const because it is written to. Given the dependency on the external API (dlsym) the lack of const on dl_handle is acceptable and the reported Rule 8.13 violation is not valid here."
