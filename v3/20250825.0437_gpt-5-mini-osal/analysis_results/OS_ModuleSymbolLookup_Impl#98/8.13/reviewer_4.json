According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so this should be 'const void *Function;'.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl:\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef uintptr_t cpuaddr\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */\n    void *dl_handle;\n} OS_impl_module_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_module_internal_record_t OS_impl_module_table[OS_MAX_MODULES]\n...\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct as written. The function shown as the target (OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl) does not declare any local pointer like 'Function' and therefore does not itself violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The variable referred to in the scenario ('Function') actually appears in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (provided in the additional code). In that function 'Function' is declared as 'void *Function;' and is only used to hold the result of dlsym(), compared with NULL and cast to an integer \u2014 it is never used to modify the pointed-to object. That means it could reasonably be declared as 'const void *Function;' to better follow Rule 8.13. So if the report was intended to target OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, the observation is valid (and easily fixed); but the specific report that OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl violates Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
