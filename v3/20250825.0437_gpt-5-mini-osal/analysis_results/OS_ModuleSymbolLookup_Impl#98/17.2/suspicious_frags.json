  "explanation": "No suspicious recursion was found in the supplied code fragments. Analysis of the call graph from the provided code: OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl calls OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl only. OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl calls library functions (dlsym, dlerror) and a logging macro (OS_DEBUG) and does not call OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl or any other function in the set. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro invokes the inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (which simply returns token->obj_idx) and does not introduce any calls that could form a cycle. There are no direct self-calls (a function invoking itself) and no indirect calls among the shown functions that form a cycle. The dlsym result is assigned to SymbolAddress but not invoked here, so no runtime callback from that lookup creates recursion within the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no self/indirect recursion)."
