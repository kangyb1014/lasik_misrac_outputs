  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The top-level if (mkdir(...) < 0) has two mutually exclusive, reachable outcomes: the error path (mkdir returns < 0) and the success path (mkdir returns >= 0). Both branches contain executable statements and are reachable at runtime depending on mkdir's return value.\n- Inside the error path, the nested if (errno == EEXIST) is reachable when mkdir fails and errno is set to EEXIST; within that, the if (stat(...) == 0 && S_ISDIR(...)) is reachable when stat succeeds and the existing pathname is a directory. None of these conditions are compile-time constant false, so they are not statically unreachable.\n- The final return return_code; is reachable on all control-flow paths because both the error and success branches assign return_code before falling through to the single return.\n- There are no early returns, conditional compilation blocks, or constant conditions that would make any statement permanently unreachable.\n\nTherefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code), there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for being unreachable."
