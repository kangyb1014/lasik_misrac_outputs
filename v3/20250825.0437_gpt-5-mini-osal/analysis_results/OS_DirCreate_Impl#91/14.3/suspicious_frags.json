  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The code contains three controlling expressions: 1) if (mkdir(local_path, S_IFDIR | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) < 0) \u2014 this invokes mkdir and depends on its runtime return value, so it is not invariant; 2) if (errno == EEXIST) \u2014 errno is a runtime-modified value set by the failed system call, so this comparison is not an invariant; 3) if (stat(local_path, &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) \u2014 both stat() result and st.st_mode are runtime-dependent, so this expression is not invariant. There are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions. The use of compile-time constants in the mode flags for mkdir is not a controlling expression and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3. Consequently, no code fragments in this function require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
