  "explanation": "To assess whether any controlling expression in OS_DirCreate_Impl is invariant you must know which parts can vary at runtime and which are compile-time constants:\n\n- mkdir: The outer if uses the expression \"mkdir(local_path, ...) < 0\". You need the mkdir symbol/prototype to establish that this is a runtime system call whose return value depends on filesystem state, path, permissions, etc., and therefore is not an invariant compile\u2011time constant.\n\n- stat: The inner test uses \"stat(local_path, &st) == 0\". You must know that stat is a runtime call that modifies 'st' and whose return value depends on filesystem state; this shows the expression can vary at runtime.\n\n- errno: The condition \"errno == EEXIST\" relies on errno being set by the failing mkdir call. You need the errno symbol semantics (it is a modifiable runtime value set by library/syscall) to show this comparison is not a compile\u2011time invariant.\n\n- EEXIST: The numeric error code compared to errno. Knowing its value/type is needed to reason about the errno comparison but it is a constant macro; the key is that errno itself is variable.\n\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO: These file\u2011mode macros are used as the second argument to mkdir. They are constants (bitmasks) so must be recognized as such; however their presence does not make the mkdir(...) < 0 test invariant \u2014 the mkdir call outcome still depends on runtime state. Including these shows which parts of the controlling expression are constant and which are not.\n\n- S_ISDIR: The expression uses S_ISDIR(st.st_mode). You need the definition/semantics of this macro to know it inspects st.st_mode (i.e., it is a bit test), and thus depends on the data written by stat at runtime \u2014 not a compile\u2011time invariant.\n\n- struct stat (st_mode): The S_ISDIR test and stat call interact via st.st_mode. Knowing the structure and that stat writes st_mode establishes that the S_ISDIR operand can change at runtime.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine that the controlling expressions (mkdir(...) < 0, errno == EEXIST, and stat(...) == 0 && S_ISDIR(...)) depend on runtime values and are therefore not invariant for the purposes of the MISRA rule."
