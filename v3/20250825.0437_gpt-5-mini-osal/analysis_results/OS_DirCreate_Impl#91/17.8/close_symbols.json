  "explanation": "Why each is required for MISRA C rule (parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- mkdir (symbol definition / macro or prototype): Determine whether mkdir is an actual function or a macro. If it is a macro it could expand into code that modifies the function parameters (e.g. by reusing the identifier local_path). If it is a function, confirm its prototype (e.g. int mkdir(const char *, mode_t)) to show it receives the pointer by value and therefore cannot modify the parameter variable local_path in this function.\n\n- stat (symbol definition / macro or prototype): Same rationale as mkdir \u2014 confirm whether stat is a macro or function and its parameter types (stat takes a pathname and a pointer to struct stat). This verifies that stat does not modify the local parameter variable itself.\n\n- errno (extern int): errno is read to compare against EEXIST. Confirming errno is the usual global ensures no hidden macro redefinition that could alter local parameters.\n\n- EEXIST (errno macro): Needed to understand the branch condition; also to check whether it is a macro that could have side effects (unlikely, but relevant if macro-mangling could affect identifiers).\n\n- S_ISDIR (macro): Used to inspect st.st_mode. Confirming S_ISDIR is a simple predicate macro (no assignment to parameters) rules out any hidden modification of parameters via macro expansion.\n\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO (macros): These mode flag macros are passed to mkdir. Confirming they are simple constants/macros ensures they do not expand into code that could modify parameters.\n\n- struct stat (type definition): Needed to inspect members and ensure no aliasing or macro manipulations involving st could affect the pointer parameter. Also to confirm usage of S_ISDIR is read-only on st.\n\n- mode_t (type used by mkdir): To validate the prototype of mkdir and its parameter types.\n\n- int32, uint32 (type definitions): To confirm the parameter types and whether any implicit macro/type substitutions might cause the parameters to be treated differently (e.g. as macros that could expand to expressions that assign to something).\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS (macros/constants): These are assigned to return_code. While not directly related to modifying parameters, including them helps the analyzer understand all identifiers assigned in the function and rules out obscure macro expansions that might modify parameters.\n\nOverall rationale: The MISRA rule disallows modifying formal parameters (the pointer variable itself). To prove compliance you must show there is no assignment to 'local_path' or 'access' in the function and that no called entity or macro expansion in the function body can expand into code that assigns to those parameter identifiers. The symbols above are exactly those whose definitions/prototypes/macros must be inspected to rule out such hidden modifications."
