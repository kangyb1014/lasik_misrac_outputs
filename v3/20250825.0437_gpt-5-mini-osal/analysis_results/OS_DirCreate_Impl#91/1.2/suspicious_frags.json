  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I checked for common compiler-specific/extension constructs such as identifiers or keywords beginning with double underscores (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC), statement-expressions ({ ... }) or other vendor-specific extensions \u2014 none are present. The code uses standard C types (int32_t/uint32_t via typedef), standard POSIX APIs/macros (mkdir, stat, errno, S_IFDIR, S_ISDIR, S_IRWXU, etc.), and simple numeric macros (OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS). These are library/OS APIs or standard headers, not compiler language extensions, so there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
