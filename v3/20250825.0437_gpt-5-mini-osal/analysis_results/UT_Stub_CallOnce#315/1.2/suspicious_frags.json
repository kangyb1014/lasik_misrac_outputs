  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- Function pointer parameter syntax (void (*Func)(void)), function calls, control structures (for, if/else), increments and array indexing are all standard C constructs.\n- The static array initialization static UT_StubTableEntry_t UT_StubTable[UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS] = {{0}} uses standard aggregate initialization (double braces for array of structs is standard) and zero initialization; this is not a compiler extension.\n- The typedefs shown (int32 from int32_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t struct, and UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS macro) are standard C uses of typedef/macros.\n- The cast FuncKey = (UT_EntryKey_t)Func converts a function pointer to an integer-typed alias (UT_EntryKey_t). Although conversion between pointers and integer types is implementation-defined in C (and thus can vary by platform), it is not by itself a compiler language extension as defined by compiler extension documentation. Therefore it is not reported under MISRA C:2012 Rule 1.2 per the instruction to report only explicit compiler-documented extensions.\n\nOne potential area that could be a compiler-specific type is the underlying definition of cpuaddr (used in typedef cpuaddr UT_EntryKey_t). If cpuaddr is a compiler-provided nonstandard built-in type (rather than a project typedef to a standard integer type like uintptr_t/unsigned long), then the typedef line using cpuaddr would be a language extension and should be investigated. However, that definition is not present in the provided code or compiler documentation here, so it cannot be definitively flagged. If you can provide the definition of cpuaddr (or compiler documentation stating cpuaddr is an extension), I can re-evaluate and mark that fragment as suspicious."
