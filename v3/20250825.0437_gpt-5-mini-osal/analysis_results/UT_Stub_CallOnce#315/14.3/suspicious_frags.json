  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. Analysis of control constructs:\n- for (i = 0; i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS; ++i) \u2014 the loop condition depends on the loop variable i, so it is not invariant (UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS is a constant bound but the controlling expression varies as i changes).\n- if (Func == NULL) and all subsequent if/else-if conditions (testing StubPtr->EntryType, OnceEnt, StubPtr->FuncKey, OnceEnt->EntryType) depend on runtime values and are not constant/invariant expressions.\n- There are no do-while or infinite-loop (for(;;) / while(1)) constructs present that would need to be considered under the stated exceptions.\nTherefore no code fragments in the provided function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and nothing needs further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
