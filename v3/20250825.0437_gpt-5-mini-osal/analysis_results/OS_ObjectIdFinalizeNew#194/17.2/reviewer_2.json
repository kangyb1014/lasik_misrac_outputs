If the registered EventHandler (an application callback) calls back into the OS notification path (for example calls OS_NotifyEvent or a function that eventually calls OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew/OS_NotifyEvent), this creates an indirect recursion: OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew -> OS_NotifyEvent -> EventHandler -> OS_NotifyEvent (or OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew) ...

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as a demonstrated MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 violation for the provided OS code. In the shown code there is no direct or statically-known indirect call chain from OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew back to itself. OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew calls OS_NotifyEvent, and OS_NotifyEvent invokes a user-registered function pointer (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler). Whether that function pointer causes an indirect recursion depends entirely on what application code installs as the EventHandler. If the application callback itself calls back into OS_NotifyEvent (or into OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew), then an indirect recursion would occur at runtime \u2014 but that is a property of the application callback, not of the OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew implementation as provided. MISRA Rule 17.2 prohibits functions calling themselves (directly or indirectly) in the analyzed code base; there is no static evidence here that OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew will call itself. A static tool that has visibility of the actual EventHandler target could flag recursion if that handler is defined to call back, but the code excerpt by itself does not violate R17.2. In short: possible runtime recursion via a user callback is not the same as a proven violation in the OS code shown."
