  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not indicate a potential Rule 8.13 violation and therefore need not be investigated: - The outid usage (*outid = final_id;) is an intentional output write; the pointer must be non-const to allow modification. - The reads of token->obj_id (final_id = token->obj_id; and OS_NotifyEvent(..., token->obj_id, ...);) show only read access from the token within this function; these occurrences alone do not prove that the token pointer could be const without examining the called functions. - The local variable final_id and its initialization/assignment are not pointer declarations and thus not relevant to pointer const-qualification. - Macros/typedefs shown (OS_SUCCESS, OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED, osal_id_t) do not involve pointer types. The two fragments reported are the places where pointer types are declared or passed; they should be inspected (including the prototypes/implementations of callee functions) to determine whether the pointers could or should point to const-qualified types."
