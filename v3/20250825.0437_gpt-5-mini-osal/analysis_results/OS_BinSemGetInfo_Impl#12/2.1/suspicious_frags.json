  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs were identified in the provided function and related definitions. Specifically:\n- OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl contains a straight-line sequence: local declaration, table lookup via the macro, a single assignment, then return. There is no code following the return, no conditional branches, no loops with subsequent code, and no labels/goto that would create unreachable regions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array indexing expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) and does not by itself introduce any control flow that could render code unreachable.\n- The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx; it contains no branching and thus cannot create unreachable code.\n- The data definitions (array OS_impl_bin_sem_table, structure members, and constants) declare objects only and do not include any dead code.\n\nNote: There are other potential issues (for example, dereferencing a NULL token pointer or an out-of-range obj_idx leading to undefined behavior), but these are not instances of unreachable code per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 and therefore do not require investigation under that rule. If you want, I can list fragments relevant to those UB concerns for separate review."
