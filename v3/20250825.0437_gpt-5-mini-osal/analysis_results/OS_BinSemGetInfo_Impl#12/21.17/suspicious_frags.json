  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that may access beyond object bounds. The provided target function OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl and the related definitions do not call any of these string-handling functions. The function only: (1) obtains a pointer into an object table via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, (2) reads a volatile sig_atomic_t current_value, and (3) assigns that integer value into sem_prop->value. There are no char buffers being written to or read from, no calls to memcpy/strcpy/strncat/strlen/etc., and no other operations that manipulate strings or raw memory blocks in the shown code. The macro expansion (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) when invoked as OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) effectively becomes &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which resolves to the original token pointer and does not involve any string operations or buffer accesses. Although the OS_bin_sem_prop_t type contains a name[] member, that member is not touched by this function. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If other source files (not provided) use string.h functions to operate on name[] or other buffers, those usages should be inspected, but they are not present in the supplied code."
