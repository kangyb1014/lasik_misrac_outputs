  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies a parameter itself. The function parameters are:\n- const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 only dereferenced as *token when passed to the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro; the pointer variable token is not assigned to or modified.\n- OS_bin_sem_prop_t *sem_prop \u2014 only used to assign to the object it points to (sem_prop->value = ...), which is allowed by the rule (modifying the pointed-to object is permitted).\nThe local variable sem is assigned from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET but this does not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
