  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that (a) perform reads/assignments that might be redundant or rely on surrounding operations (potential dead assignments or reliance on prior memset for string termination), (b) use the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro with an address-of expression that can hide unexpected/addressing-side effects, and (c) declare volatile fields that could indicate read/write operations elsewhere that should be checked for actual use. Other code fragments were not included because they are either: (1) declarations only (type and function declarations) which are not executed code and therefore not subject to Rule 2.2; (2) obvious, necessary control-flow or error-check operations (parameter checks, return statements, OS_ObjectIdGetById call) that have observable effects and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; or (3) operations that clearly initialize or populate outputs used later (e.g. assigning name and creator fields in the caller, releasing the token) and so are not dead. In addition, simple usages such as taking the object index via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are direct accesses required to locate the table entry and thus are not considered dead. If any of the flagged fragments are proven necessary after review (for example, memset enabling null-termination of strncpy, volatile reads being required for semantics), they can be dismissed; otherwise they merit further investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
