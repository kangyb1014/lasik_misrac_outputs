  "explanation": "- osal_objtype_t: needed to confirm the parameter is a plain value type (e.g., enum or integer) and not a typedef that could hide pointer semantics or unusual side effects. If this were a macro or alias to a modifiable lvalue, the rule analysis would change.  \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: this symbol is indexed by the parameter (OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]). We must see whether it is an ordinary array/object or a macro whose expansion could modify idtype (e.g., via side effects). The exact declaration/definition shows whether indexing is a simple read or could trigger modification of the parameter.  \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: to inspect the type returned from the table lookup and ensure no hidden aliasing could result in indirect modification of the parameter. Understanding the structure is also needed to reason about impl usage.  \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t::mutex (member type, typically pthread_mutex_t): to verify that accessing impl->mutex and calling pthread_mutex_lock cannot legally/illegitimately modify the idtype parameter (e.g., via unusual implementation-defined aliasing).  \n- OS_DEBUG (macro or function): OS_DEBUG is invoked in the function; if it is a macro it could expand to code that (unexpectedly) references or modifies the parameter. We need its definition to rule that out.  \n- pthread_mutex_lock (declaration/macro): include to confirm it cannot modify the function's parameter (it operates on the mutex argument only and is not a macro that could capture idtype).  \n- strerror (declaration/macro): included for the same reason as pthread_mutex_lock/OS_DEBUG \u2014 if any of these are implemented as macros or have side effects they might reference/modify local variables; confirm they do not touch the parameter.\n\nThese symbols together allow checking (1) that idtype is a non\u2011pointer value, (2) that every use of idtype in the function is a read (no macro expansion or indexing that could assign to idtype), and (3) that no called macro/function invoked from this function can indirectly modify the parameter."
