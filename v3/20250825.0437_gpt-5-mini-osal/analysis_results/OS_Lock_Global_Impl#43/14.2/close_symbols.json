Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop well-formed' analysis:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The global array indexed by idtype is read by the function. Need its declaration/type to verify that the indexing expression has no hidden side effects (e.g. overloaded macro, accessor function, or volatile qualifiers) and to confirm there is no implicit loop-like behaviour in the expression used to obtain impl.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The index type used to access OS_impl_objtype_lock_table. Its underlying type and definition are needed to ensure the indexing expression is a plain value expression (no side effects) and to rule out any macro or complex type that could embed looping behaviour.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The type of the table entries. Required to inspect the member impl->mutex (its type and any special semantics). Also needed to detect if the struct contains inline functions/macros or member accessors that could contain for-loops or side effects when accessed.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - This function is called from the target. The MISRA text states that the behaviour of called functions is part of the loop body for analysis of for-loops; therefore inspect pthread_mutex_lock implementation/declaration to see whether it contains for-loops (and whether they are well-formed) or has side effects relevant to loop-counter rules.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  - The type of impl->mutex. Needed to confirm that taking &impl->mutex is a simple pointer to a plain object (no overloaded semantics) and to examine any inline operations/macros associated with the mutex type that could include for-loops when used.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Likely a macro or function used for logging. Its expansion may call other functions or contain control structures (including for-loops). The macro/func definition must be inspected to ensure it does not introduce any for-loops or hidden side effects that would affect compliance.\n\n- strerror\n  - Called to produce the diagnostic string. Although from the C library, its implementation could include loops; include its declaration/implementation (or at least confirm it is a simple library call) to determine whether any for-loops are introduced into the flow.\n\n- <pthread.h> declaration(s)\n  - The header(s) that declare pthread types/functions (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_t, etc.) to ensure there are no inline macros or definitions that introduce looping constructs or side effects at the call site.\n\n- <string.h> declaration(s)\n  - The header that declares strerror and related functions/macros; needed to verify strerror is a simple function call and not a macro wrapping code with loops.\n\nRationale summary: The target function itself contains no for-loop syntaxes, but MISRA requires that the behaviour of any functions/macros called (and any expressions used) be considered part of the loop body when determining well-formedness. Therefore the table, index type, record type and the definitions/implementations of pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_t, OS_DEBUG, and strerror (and their declaring headers) must be inspected to ensure no hidden for-loops or side-effecting expressions exist that could violate the MISRA for-loop clauses."
