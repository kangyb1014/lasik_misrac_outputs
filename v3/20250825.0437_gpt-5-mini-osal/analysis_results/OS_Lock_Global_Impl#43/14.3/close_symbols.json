  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The controlling expression is \"impl != NULL\", where impl is assigned from OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]. You must see the array/variable definition (type, size, initializers, storage class such as const/volatile, and whether its elements can change at runtime) to determine if the loaded pointer can ever differ from NULL or is invariant.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The index value idtype determines which array element is read. The type/definition (enum/range/constraints) is needed to know the set of possible indices and whether idtype can vary at runtime or is constrained to a single value (which could make the expression invariant).\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The element type stored in the table. Knowing the underlying type (pointer vs object, any qualifiers) and if the field assignments are well-formed is necessary to confirm that the assignment yields a genuine pointer that can be NULL or non-NULL; also to check any qualifiers (volatile) that affect whether the value is considered invariant.\n\n- OS_Lock_Global: This caller constructs/passes idtype to OS_Lock_Global_Impl. The caller\u2019s implementation (how idtype is derived/validated) may constrain idtype to a single value or always choose an index whose table entry is always NULL/non-NULL; examine the caller to determine whether the controlling expression can actually vary.\n\n- (any) functions/initializers that write or initialize OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: If the table is populated at startup or modified by other functions, those symbols (initializers or writers) must be inspected to determine whether entries can change over time. If the table is only ever initialized to a constant set of values (all NULL or all non-NULL), the condition would be invariant.\n\nThese symbols together let you decide if \"impl != NULL\" (and/or the index expression) can vary at runtime or is effectively constant, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule on invariant controlling expressions."
