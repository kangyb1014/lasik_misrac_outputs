  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl violates the MISRA C rule on use of <string.h> functions, the analyzer must know exactly which string-handling operations occur and whether any of them can access beyond object bounds. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- strerror\n  - strerror is the only direct string-related library call in the function. The analyzer needs its declaration/semantics (return value, whether it returns a pointer to a static buffer, whether it may write into a caller-provided buffer in this environment, thread-safety variants like strerror_r, etc.) to determine whether using its return value with %s can cause out-of-bounds accesses (for example if it returned a pointer into a transient/overwritten buffer).\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - OS_DEBUG is used to format and emit the message containing the string returned by strerror. Its implementation (macro or function) must be inspected to determine whether it uses any string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/strcat/strlen/etc.) or internal fixed-size buffers that might be overflowed when formatting the strerror output. If OS_DEBUG copies or concatenates strings unsafely, the MISRA rule could be violated indirectly.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The array/table is indexed by idtype to obtain impl. Knowing its type, lifetime and bounds is useful to ensure that impl is a valid pointer when non-NULL; while this does not directly involve string.h functions, it is required to reason about whether impl->mutex (and subsequent logging) is operating on valid data structures. Also if any debug/logging code uses data from that structure in string operations, the table's definition helps trace that.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The structure definition (especially the type of .mutex and any string members) is needed to know whether accessing impl->mutex is valid and whether any members might be used in subsequent string operations inside OS_DEBUG or other helper functions.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - The prototype/semantics are needed to confirm what ret value means (error number vs -1/errno) because passing that value to strerror must be semantically correct. If ret is not a valid errno value for strerror, an implementation-defined behavior could occur; knowing pthread_mutex_lock behavior helps confirm the call to strerror is appropriate.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  - The mutex type is part of OS_impl_objtype_lock_t. Its definition helps ensure impl->mutex is a legal object (and not, for example, overlayed with char buffers used by string functions) and to trace any interactions that might involve string operations.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The index type for OS_impl_objtype_lock_table. The analyzer may need its definition/range to check that idtype is within valid bounds for the table (to ensure the table lookup does not produce an invalid pointer that could later cause out-of-bounds string accesses in logging or other code).\n\nIn summary: strerror and OS_DEBUG are the primary symbols needed to judge direct and indirect uses of <string.h> operations. The table, its element type, the mutex type and related pthread symbols are included to permit full tracing of validity of the impl pointer and the correctness of the strerror usage context, since improper pointer/structure handling could lead to unsafe string operations in the logging path."
