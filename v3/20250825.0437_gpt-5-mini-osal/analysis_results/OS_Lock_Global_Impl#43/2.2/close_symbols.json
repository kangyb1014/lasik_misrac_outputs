  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to decide if this code is dead):\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The body is conditional on impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]; determining whether the if (impl != NULL) branch can ever be taken requires knowing the contents, lifetime and possible values stored in this global table. If every entry is always NULL, the branch is dead.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The type definition (struct) reveals the mutex member and any semantics about its initialization/state. Knowing the layout and any invariants is necessary to reason about side effects of locking and whether impl->mutex is meaningful.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The idtype value is used to index the table. You must know the valid range/encoding of osal_objtype_t and whether callers ever supply values that map to non-NULL table entries (or whether out-of-range indexing is prevented), to determine executability of the branch.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - This is the primary side-effecting call inside the guarded block. To decide if removing the call would change program behaviour, you must know its semantics and whether it can be relied upon to perform locking; if it has observable effects (it does), the code is not dead even if rarely executed.\n\n- pthread_mutex_init (or other places that initialize impl->mutex)\n  - Whether pthread_mutex_lock can meaningfully succeed/fail depends on whether the mutex was initialized. If mutexes are never initialized (or always left in a state that makes lock a no-op), the locking call might be effectively inert. Knowing where/if impl->mutex is initialized is required.\n\n- strerror\n  - Called to build the diagnostic message in the error path. If OS_DEBUG expands to nothing or does not evaluate its arguments, the strerror call might not be evaluated; otherwise it has observable behavior (reads errno mapping) and could be considered side-effectful for diagnostics.\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro or function)\n  - If OS_DEBUG is a no-op macro that removes its arguments at compile time, the diagnostic call (and nested strerror) may be compiled away \u2014 affecting whether any part of the error path is dead. Need the exact definition/expansion of OS_DEBUG to see if the error-reporting code is ever executed/evaluated.\n\n- OS_Lock_Global\n  - Caller of this function; to determine realistic idtype values passed you must examine call sites in the caller(s). The caller's usage patterns can show whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl ever receives idtypes that map to non-NULL entries.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry\n  - These are the callers of OS_Lock_Global (per the static call graph). Inspecting them shows what idtype values are used and whether they exercise the guarded branch, which bears on whether the target function's body is ever executed in practice.\n\n- All functions/places that populate or clear entries of OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (module init, object-registration code)\n  - Any initialization/registration code that sets entries non-NULL (or clears them) directly determines whether impl != NULL can be true at runtime. You must inspect those symbols to know if the guarded block is reachable or if its removal would not affect behaviour.\n\nIn short: to decide if the guarded block (the pthread_mutex_lock + error-reporting) is dead code you must know (a) whether the table entry can ever be non-NULL for any idtype passed by callers, (b) whether the mutex is initialized such that locking has observable effects, and (c) whether the diagnostic path is compiled/evaluated (OS_DEBUG/strerror). The symbols above are the minimal items needed to answer those questions."
