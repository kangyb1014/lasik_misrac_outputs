  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not invoke string.h memory/string-handling functions that take pointer parameters and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. In particular: - pthread_setcancelstate(...) and pthread_setcanceltype(...) are POSIX thread control calls and do not perform string/memory operations from <string.h>. - The assignment arg.id = global_task_id; only writes to a union member and is not a call to a string handling routine. - pthread_setspecific(...) stores a void* in thread-local storage but is not a <string.h> function; any issues with pointer representation or use of the stored value are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. - The return-value checks and integer-to-status handling do not involve string.h functions. Therefore only the memset call and the use of strerror inside the debugging print (both from <string.h> or related string handling) are reported for investigation under Rule 21.17."
