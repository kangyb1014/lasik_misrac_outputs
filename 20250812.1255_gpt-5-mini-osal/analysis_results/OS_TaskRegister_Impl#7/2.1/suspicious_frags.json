  "explanation": "Only the fragments listed above need further investigation with respect to unreachable code. The remaining parts of the function are plain declarations, comments, and normal control-flow constructs (variable declarations, the function prologue/epilogue, and the final return) and do not themselves create unreachable code. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty and therefore does not introduce unreachable code (it only elides logging). The union usage (memset followed by assigning to a union member and later reading a different union member) may be a correctness/aliasing concern but does not by itself produce unreachable code. There are no early return statements or conditional compilation branches elsewhere in this function that would render subsequent lines unreachable, so no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
