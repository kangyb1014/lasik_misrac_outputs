  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileOpen_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode)\n{\n    int                             os_perm;\n    int                             os_mode;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n    ** Check for a valid access mode\n    ** For creating a file, OS_READ_ONLY does not make sense\n    */\n    switch (access_mode)\n    {\n        case OS_WRITE_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_WRONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_RDONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_WRITE:\n            os_perm = O_RDWR;\n            break;\n        default:\n            return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_CREAT;\n    }\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_TRUNCATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_TRUNC;\n    }\n\n    os_perm |= OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS;\n\n    os_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH;\n\n    impl->fd = open(local_path, os_perm, os_mode);\n\n    if (impl->fd < 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"open(%s): %s\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno));\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If the flags included O_NONBLOCK, then\n     * enable the \"select\" call on this handle.\n     */\n    impl->selectable = ((os_perm & O_NONBLOCK) != 0);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileOpen_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nextern OS_impl_file_internal_record_t OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int  fd;\n    bool selectable;\n} OS_impl_file_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\nextern const int OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS\n...\n#define OS_WRITE_ONLY 1\n...\n#define OS_READ_ONLY 0\n...\n#define OS_READ_WRITE 2\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nos_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment to os_mode is used as the third argument to open(local_path, os_perm, os_mode). When OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE is set the O_CREAT bit is added to os_perm and the open call requires the mode, so the assignment affects program behaviour. (It would only be dead code if, across the entire project, files are never opened with OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE so the mode is never used.)"
