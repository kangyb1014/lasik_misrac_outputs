  "explanation": "I examined the function and related declarations for any compiler-specific language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, Microsoft __declspec, GCC/Clang extensions, inline assembly, nonstandard keywords, or other compiler-specific tokens). None are present in the provided code. The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature (variadic macros), and static inline is standard C99. The use of POSIX APIs/macros (open, O_RDONLY, O_CREAT, S_IRUSR, etc.) are platform APIs, not compiler language extensions. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET uses address-of on the supplied expression but does not rely on any compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that appear to use compiler language extensions that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
