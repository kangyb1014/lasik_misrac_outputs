  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rationale:\n- The token parameter is declared const OS_object_token_t *token, so the function does not take a mutable pointer where a const pointer would suffice.\n- local_path is declared const char *local_path and is passed to open(), which expects a const char *; this correctly uses a const-qualified pointer.\n- The impl variable is declared as OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl and is written to (impl->fd and impl->selectable). Because the code modifies the pointed-to object, it must be a non-const pointer; making it point to const would prevent required updates.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table is an external mutable array of records; obtaining a pointer to its elements must yield a non-const pointer if the elements are to be modified, so this is appropriate.\n- OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS is declared const int and is used read-only.\n- Use of strerror() returns a non-const char * by the C library; it is only used for diagnostic output and not modified here.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro takes the address of its token argument; in this call it is passed *token (a const object), so the address expression yields a pointer with the correct const qualification; there is no hidden non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer would suffice.\nGiven the above, no pointer in this function can or should be more const-qualified without preventing necessary modifications or breaking required API usage."
