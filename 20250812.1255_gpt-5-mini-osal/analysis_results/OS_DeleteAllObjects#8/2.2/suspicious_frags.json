  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed were reviewed and judged unlikely to be dead code for the purposes of MISRA C Rule 2.2: - Simple initializations (e.g. ObjectCount = 0) are necessary for correct loop logic. - OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit assignments to iter->limit and iter->base are used by the iterator logic and so are not dead. - The OS_TaskDelay_Impl implementation (timespec arithmetic and clock_nanosleep loop) performs the sleep operation and its removal would clearly affect timing behaviour. - Macro definitions and constant declarations (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB) are compile-time constants and not executed operations. - OS_API_Teardown calling OS_DeleteAllObjects and OS_ApplicationShutdown is purposeful teardown behavior. The fragments listed above were selected because they represent places where executed operations may be redundant (e.g. duplicated iteration over object types, incrementing a try counter and an unconditional delay that might be bypassed, incrementing the object count regardless of deletion success, an empty default switch branch, or unlocking/locking around a callback whose return is not propagated). These deserve investigation to determine whether removing them would or would not change program behaviour and therefore whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
