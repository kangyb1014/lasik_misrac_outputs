  "explanation": "I scanned the provided function for any uses of the standard library function memcmp or other string-comparison operations. There is no direct call to memcmp, no string library functions (strcmp/strcpy/etc.), and no literal string comparisons in the remaining lines (variable declaration, sem_wait call, and return statements), so those lines do not need investigation for Rule 21.14. The only places that could potentially hide a memcmp usage are the function parameter/type and the macro invocation (which is why those fragments are reported); all other fragments are not relevant to the rule."
