  "explanation": "No uses of the C <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code. The function parameters and local variables do not involve char* buffers or string operations\u2014only a token pointer, an impl pointer, a macro-based table lookup (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), and a semaphore wait call (sem_wait). sem_wait operates on a semaphore object, not on string buffers. While OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro and its definition is not shown, there is no evidence in the shown code that it expands to any <string.h> calls; therefore there is no direct indication of any access-beyond-bounds via standard string functions. For these reasons there are no code fragments in this snippet that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
