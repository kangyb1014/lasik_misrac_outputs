If Addr is truncated or actually contains an IPv4 address (e.g. Addr->ActualLength is smaller than sizeof(struct in6_addr) or the stored address is only sockaddr_in), inet_ntop will read the IPv6 address bytes beyond the bounds of Addr->AddrData, resulting in an out-of-bounds access. Because there is no validation of the contained address length/type before taking &sa_in6.sin6_addr, this can violate the requirement that string/memory-handling operations must not access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl_probe(const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr,\n                                              const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor,\n                                              int family,\n                                              const void *addrbuffer,\n                                              size_t buflen)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/111.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Log basic control/state information */\n    fprintf(f, \"--- OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl probe ---\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"Addr=%p, Accessor=%p, family=%d, addrbuffer=%p, buflen=%zu\\n\",\n            (const void *)Addr, (const void *)Accessor, family, addrbuffer, buflen);\n\n    /* Log compile-time sizes of the address structures (type-only; sizeof will not dereference) */\n    fprintf(f, \"sizeof(sa_in.sin_addr) = %zu, sizeof(sa_in6.sin6_addr) = %zu\\n\",\n            sizeof(Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr), sizeof(Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr));\n\n    /* Size of the stored AddrData array (this is a compile-time/compile-layout value) */\n    fprintf(f, \"sizeof(Addr->AddrData) = %zu\\n\", sizeof(Addr->AddrData));\n\n    /* Hex dump up to a reasonable cap of the stored AddrData bytes to show actual contents */\n    {\n        /* Use the address of the first element to get a pointer to the bytes.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the cited rule. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns the use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strlen, etc.) and requires that calls to those functions do not access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The code in question calls inet_ntop (a networking/inet function), not a <string.h> function, so a violation of 21.17 has not been demonstrated.\n\nThat said, the scenario described by agent A does point out a legitimate potential out-of-bounds/undefined-behaviour issue in the code: the implementation takes the address of Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr and passes it to inet_ntop without verifying that Addr->AddrData actually contains a full IPv6 sockaddr (i.e. that the stored buffer is large enough and the family/length fields are consistent). If Addr->AddrData is smaller or contains an IPv4 sockaddr while sa_family claims AF_INET6, reading the in6_addr bytes could access beyond the bounds of Addr->AddrData and cause undefined behaviour. This is a real safety/robustness concern, but it would be a violation of rules about object bounds, pointer use and defensive validation rather than MISRA 21.17 specifically.\n\nRecommendation: validate the stored address length / family before taking &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr (for example by checking an explicit length field or that sizeof(Addr->AddrData) is large enough for the selected family), or copy only the available bytes to a local in6_addr buffer before calling inet_ntop. Also ensure the probe code compiles in your build environment (the failure to compile likely stems from access/definition mismatches or compilation options, not from the logic above)."
