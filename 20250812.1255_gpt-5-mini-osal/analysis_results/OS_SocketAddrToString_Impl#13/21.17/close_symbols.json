  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- inet_ntop\n  - Required to know the exact prototype and documented behavior: how it uses the dst and size parameters, whether it guarantees not to write beyond the provided buflen, and what it does on insufficient buffer (return value, errno, partial writes). This determines whether passing buffer + buflen here can lead to out-of-bounds writes (the MISRA concern).\n\n- INET_ADDRSTRLEN and INET6_ADDRSTRLEN\n  - Standard constants that specify the minimum safe buffer sizes for IPv4 and IPv6 textual representations. Needed to check whether callers supply at least these minimums for the given sa_family, and to compare buflen against required maxima.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6\n  - The switch uses these macros to select the address type. Their meanings determine which textual-size constant applies and therefore which bound checks are required.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t\n  - The target function receives a const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr. Its definition is needed to confirm the size/layout of Addr, the presence/size of AddrData, and to ensure the cast &Addr->AddrData to an accessor is valid (no out-of-bounds access when taking addr fields).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t\n  - The function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and then reads sa.sa_family and uses sa_in.sin_addr / sa_in6.sin6_addr. The accessor's layout (offsets, unions/structs) is required to confirm that addrbuffer points into valid memory inside Addr and is correctly typed.\n\n- struct sockaddr, struct sockaddr_in, struct sockaddr_in6\n  - These standard socket structures define sa_family, sin_addr, sin6_addr, and sizes. Needed to verify that the accessor fields used (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) map correctly and that the addrbuffer passed to inet_ntop has the expected size and alignment.\n\n- struct in_addr, struct in6_addr\n  - Types of the address buffers passed to inet_ntop. Their sizes and layouts matter to ensure the addrbuffer pointer passed references a full address object and no partial/overrun memory is referenced.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrToString\n  - This wrapper function calls OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl. Its implementation (how it supplies buffer and buflen) is required to determine the typical/possible values for buffer and buflen, and whether callers guarantee adequate buflen (e.g., passing a fixed-size stack buffer of limited length).\n\n- OS_CreateSocketName\n  - A direct caller of the Impl function (per the static call graph). Its use of buffer and buflen (allocation, length passed) must be inspected to see if any caller can pass a buflen too small relative to the address family, which would allow inet_ntop (or any string handling it uses) to exceed buffer bounds.\n\nOverall: these symbols let the analyst determine (1) that the correct address bytes are selected and fully present in memory, (2) the required textual output sizes per family, (3) the guarantees provided by inet_ntop about respecting buflen, and (4) whether callers ever pass buffers smaller than required. Together this information is necessary to decide if any string handling (direct or inside inet_ntop) can write beyond the provided buffer and thus violate the MISRA string-bounds rule."
