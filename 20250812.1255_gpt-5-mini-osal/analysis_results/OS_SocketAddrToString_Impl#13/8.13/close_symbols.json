  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' you must inspect the actual types and const-qualifications involved in each pointer use and any casts. Specifically:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (full definition, including AddrData member): needed to know the declared type of Addr->AddrData and whether accessing &Addr->AddrData yields a pointer-to-const (Addr is a const pointer to OS_SockAddr_t) and whether any internal members are themselves const-qualified.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (full definition): the code casts &Addr->AddrData to const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t*. You must see the accessor's declaration to confirm the const is appropriate and whether any members it points to should have stronger const qualification.\n\n- type/definition of Accessor->sa (e.g., struct sockaddr) and its members: to determine constness of the sa member and of its family field (sa_family) used in the switch and whether taking addresses of nested members respects const rules.\n\n- type/definition of Accessor->sa_in (struct sockaddr_in) and member sin_addr: needed because addrbuffer \u2190 &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr; you must know the exact type of sin_addr (and whether it is declared const) to check whether assigning its address to a const void* is appropriate or if the pointer should be a non-const.\n\n- type/definition of Accessor->sa_in6 (struct sockaddr_in6) and member sin6_addr: same rationale for the IPv6 path (only present when OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined).\n\n- struct in_addr and struct in6_addr (or the concrete types used): to confirm whether these target objects are inherently mutable and whether taking their addresses and binding to const-qualified pointers is permitted/required by MISRA.\n\n- prototype of inet_ntop: its parameter types (particularly the src argument) determine whether addrbuffer should be const void* (inet_ntop takes const void *src). Confirming the function prototype ensures the chosen const qualification for addrbuffer matches the API and that no unnecessary removal/addition of const occurs.\n\n- macros AF_INET and AF_INET6: to verify which case labels are active and that control flow to the lines that take addresses of sin_addr/sin6_addr is reachable; this affects whether those pointer uses need const qualification in compiled configurations.\n\n- macro OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: to know whether the AF_INET6 branch exists in the build being analyzed (affects whether sa_in6 / sin6_addr usages must be considered).\n\nThese symbols allow a precise determination of whether any pointer in the function could/should be declared with stronger const qualification (or whether any cast drops const) and therefore whether the code violates the MISRA rule."
