  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions were found in the provided code. I checked for common and explicit extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, including: use of compiler builtin keywords or identifiers beginning with double underscores (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __typeof__), inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) GCC extension, nested functions, zero-length arrays or nonstandard flexible array declarations, _Pragma or pragma directives that are compiler-specific, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or any other nonstandard keyword. The code only uses standard C constructs, POSIX library calls (inet_ntop) and project typedefs/macros (int32, OS_ERR_*, OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6) which are not compiler language extensions. Items that might be questionable for other MISRA rules but are not language extensions and therefore not relevant to Rule 1.2 (and so are not reported here) include: the pointer cast \"(const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData\" (potential aliasing/strict-aliasing concerns), the unreachable break after a return in the default case, and reliance on system types/macros such as AF_INET/AF_INET6. These should be reviewed under other MISRA rules, but they are not compiler language extensions and thus do not trigger Rule 1.2."
