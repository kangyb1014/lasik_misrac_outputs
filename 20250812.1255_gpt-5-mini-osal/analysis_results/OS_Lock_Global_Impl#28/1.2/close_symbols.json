  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions of the identifiers and types referenced by the function: \n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: This is the type of 'impl'. You must examine the struct/typedef to see if it uses any compiler extensions (e.g. __attribute__((...)), unnamed/zero-width bitfields, typeof, statement-expressions, packed/aligned GCC attributes, flexible array uses that rely on extensions, or other non\u2011standard constructs).\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: This global/extern object supplies 'impl'. Its declaration/definition could use extensions (section attributes, non-standard linkage, variable length arrays, custom attribute macros) or be defined with a nonstandard type that propagates extensions.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro/function is invoked in the error path. Macros are a common place to hide compiler extensions (statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, labels-as-values, __attribute__ annotations, variadic macro extensions). You must inspect its definition to ensure it is standard-conforming.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The parameter type for the function. If this is an enum or typedef that uses extensions (explicit underlying width, non-standard enum extension, attributes), that would be relevant.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: Although a POSIX API, its declaration in system headers could employ compiler-specific attributes or macros. Confirming its prototype is necessary to ensure no extension usage is relied upon by the call (and to check errno/return handling semantics if they hide extensions).\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: The type of impl->mutex. The actual pthread_mutex_t typedef/definition in the platform headers may use implementation-specific constructs or compiler extensions (e.g. anonymous structs, attributes, atomic types). Inspect it to ensure no language extensions are required/used.\n\n- strerror: The diagnostic call is to strerror; its declaration or macro implementation should be checked (it can be a macro or inline wrapper using attributes) to ensure it doesn't introduce compiler extensions.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their header/definition locations) lets you verify whether any non\u2011standard language/compiler extensions are present in code paths or declarations used by OS_Lock_Global_Impl. Only by examining these related symbols can you be confident that the target function does not rely on language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
