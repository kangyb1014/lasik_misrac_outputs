The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For analyzing MISRA C rule about well-formed for loops in the context of this function you must consider any symbols that affect control-flow or could hide for-loops in called code or macros:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - Reason: The function reads impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]; the definition tells whether this access can expand to something with hidden control-flow (e.g., a macro or accessor that contains a for loop) and whether indexing could have side effects.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - Reason: The pointed-to type must be inspected to ensure the member access impl->mutex is a plain data member access (no overloaded/macro behavior) and to confirm there are no function-like macros or inline functions embedded that contain for loops.\n\n- impl->mutex (type: pthread_mutex_t)\n  - Reason: Knowing the actual type of the mutex member is needed to determine whether &impl->mutex is a simple address expression or a macro/inline wrapper that could contain for loops or other side effects.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - Reason: This is called from the function. The MISRA rule states that the behaviour of the loop body includes called functions; conversely, if the called function contains for-loops that might violate the rule, that is relevant. Also need its prototype to confirm it does not modify loop counters or other objects in hypothetical loops.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Reason: Likely a macro or function used on error. If it is a macro it could expand to code containing for-loops or other control-flow; must inspect its definition to rule that out.\n\n- strerror\n  - Reason: Called on error return. Though typically a library function, its implementation (or a macro wrapper) could contain loops; need to know whether its use introduces any for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - Reason: Type of idtype used to index the table. Its definition (enum/integer width) is needed to ensure the indexing expression is simple and has no side effects (no overloaded operators/macros) and to rule out hidden control-flow.\n\nNote: The target function contains no for statement itself. The above symbols are those that must be inspected to ensure there are no hidden or macro-expanded for loops in expressions or called functions/macros that would bring the MISRA for-loop constraints into scope."
