  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not call any of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and therefore does not need investigation under this rule. Specifically:\n- The variable declarations (OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl; int ret;) are not string operations.\n- The table access and assignment (impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];) is a pointer/index operation but does not invoke any <string.h> functions or perform buffer/string manipulation.\n- The null check (if (impl != NULL)) and the pthread call (ret = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mutex);) operate on mutex objects and integers, not on string buffers or functions from <string.h>.\n- The function signature and closing braces contain no string handling.\n\nThus, aside from the single call that uses strerror(...) inside the OS_DEBUG invocation (reported above), there are no other fragments in this function that fall under the scope of Rule 21.17."
