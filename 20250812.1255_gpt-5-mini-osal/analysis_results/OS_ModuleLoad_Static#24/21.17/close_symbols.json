  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t (type definition)\n  - Needed to know the exact types and layout of the fields accessed (Name and Module). Are they char * pointers or fixed-size char arrays? That determines whether comparing/reading them (and the ++StaticSym pointer arithmetic) can read past object bounds.\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (declaration/initializer/content)\n  - The code walks this table with ++StaticSym until a sentinel (Name == NULL). To prove strcmp cannot read out of bounds you must know whether this symbol refers to a contiguous array with a terminating sentinel entry, its length (if any), and its storage lifetime. If the table is not a properly terminated array, the loop could run off the end and dereference invalid memory.\n\n- Initializer/population code for the elements of OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (where .Name and .Module are assigned)\n  - Even if the table exists, each element\u2019s .Module and .Name must be valid, null-terminated strings (or NULL). You must inspect how these fields are set (compile-time initializers or run-time assignments) to ensure they never point to non-terminated buffers or to memory that can be shorter than expected. This is required to determine whether strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) can read beyond the bounds of the objects.\n\n- OS_ModuleLoad (caller) \u2014 its parameter validation / how ModuleName is obtained before calling OS_ModuleLoad_Static\n  - The target function does not check ModuleName for NULL before passing it to strcmp. Passing a NULL ModuleName to strcmp is undefined and violates the MISRA rule (access beyond bounds). You must inspect caller(s) to determine whether ModuleName can be NULL or is validated beforehand.\n\n- strcmp declaration / behaviour from <string.h>\n  - To apply the MISRA rule you must use the standard semantics of strcmp: it reads both operands until a '\\0' and requires non-NULL pointers. Including the strcmp specification makes explicit that passing a NULL or non-terminated string will cause out-of-bounds reads.\n\nNotes\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND are not required to assess out-of-bounds string accesses (they only affect return codes).\n- If the table population code shows .Module and .Name are always NULL-terminated and the caller guarantees ModuleName non-NULL, then the use of strcmp here can be shown safe with respect to the MISRA string-bounds rule. Conversely, if any of those symbols allow NULL or non-terminated buffers, the code violates the rule."
