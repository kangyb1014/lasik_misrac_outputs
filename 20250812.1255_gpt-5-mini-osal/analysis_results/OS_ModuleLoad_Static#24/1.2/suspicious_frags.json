  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The constructs present are all standard C: typedef of a const-qualified anonymous struct (valid C), pointer declaration and initialization from a macro (OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE expands to a symbol but the macro itself is not shown as an extension), pointer comparison with NULL, use of strcmp from the C library, pointer increment (++StaticSym), function pointer member type (void (*Address)(void)), and use of integer macros for error/success codes. None of these are compiler-specific extensions per common compiler documentation.\n\nNotes for reviewers: the only items outside the shown code that could potentially involve extensions are how OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE (the macro behind OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) is defined or any attributes applied where that symbol is declared (for example compiler-specific section attributes, pragmas, or nonstandard linkage annotations). Those definitions are not part of the supplied code, so they are not flagged here. If OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE or related declarations use compiler-specific attributes (e.g., __attribute__((...)), _Pragma with vendor extensions, __declspec, or other documented extensions), those should be inspected separately."
