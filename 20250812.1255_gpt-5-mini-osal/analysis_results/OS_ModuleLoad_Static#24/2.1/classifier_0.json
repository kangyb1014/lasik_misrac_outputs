  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment: initializing StaticSym from the macro does not itself create unreachable code. OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is expected to be a pointer/array to the static symbol table; the loop condition (StaticSym != NULL) and the sentinel check (StaticSym->Name == NULL) allow the loop body to be reached and to terminate correctly. Only a hypothetical violation would occur if OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE were defined unconditionally as NULL (or otherwise provably such that the loop body can never be entered) across the entire project\u2014then the while-loop body would be unreachable, which would violate Rule 2.1\u2014but no such guaranteed-NULL definition is present here."
