  "explanation": "The fragments selected above all participate in the loop control and function exit; whether parts of the loop body or the final return are reachable depends on how OS_STATIC_SYM(T)TABLE is defined (pointer vs array/sentinel) and on runtime contents of the symbol table. These should be investigated to ensure no code is actually unreachable.\n\nOther parts of the function need not be investigated for unreachable-code concerns: the initialization of return_code to OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND is a normal default and is reachable; the typedef definition of OS_static_symbol_record_t and the #define that aliases OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE are declarations/macros that by themselves do not constitute unreachable code (their potential effects are the reason the loop/assignment above were flagged); the guarded call to strcmp uses short-circuit evaluation (the module-null check prevents calling strcmp on a NULL pointer), so the call site is correctly protected rather than containing unreachable statements. Therefore those non-selected fragments do not by themselves indicate unreachable code and do not require further investigation for Rule 2.1."
