The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: Need the definition (object or macro) and its initializer to determine what StaticSym initially points to. If this symbol is a macro or has non-trivial initialization it could expand to or hide additional code/side-effects (even a for loop or other control) that would be relevant to checking the MISRA for-loop rule.\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: Need the struct/type declaration (including types of the fields Name and Module). This is required to verify that ++StaticSym is plain pointer arithmetic that only modifies the loop counter (the pointer) and does not have hidden side effects, and to confirm that the fields tested (Name, Module) are simple pointer/data fields that are not modified in the loop body.\n- strcmp: Need the prototype/implementation to confirm that strcmp has no persistent side effects and does not modify objects used for loop control. The MISRA rule requires considering the behaviour of any functions called inside loop constructs; if strcmp were a macro or non-standard wrapper with side effects it could affect compliance.\n- NULL: Need the definition of NULL to ensure the comparisons (StaticSym == NULL and StaticSym->Name == NULL) are simple pointer comparisons and not macros that could introduce side effects or expanded code.\n\nNote: The target function contains a while loop, not a for loop. The symbols above are the minimal set required to be certain there are no hidden/macro-expanded for-loops or side effects that would make a for-loop rule relevant. Other constants in the function (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND, int32) do not affect the analysis of the MISRA for-loop rule and were therefore omitted."
