  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were reviewed and do not appear to require investigation for Rule 8.13: - The function parameters phys_path and virt_path are declared as const char * (const-qualified), which follows the rule for input string pointers. - filesys_id is an output parameter and must be a non-const osal_id_t * so it can be written; therefore it should NOT be const. - The local pointer filesys is used to modify the filesystem record fields, so it must be a non-const pointer. - The strncpy calls use standard semantics (source arguments are const char *), and the destinations are writable arrays; these are const-correct. - Calls that pass &token (OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl, OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew) operate on a token object that is expected to be modified or finalized; those pointer parameters are purposely non-const. The selected fragments are where const-qualification issues are most likely (library functions returning non-const pointers from const inputs or API/macros accepting non-const char * while the actual argument is const), and thus should be investigated further for compliance with Rule 8.13."
