  "explanation": "For assessing whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions, the next analyst must know the exact definitions/types of the following symbols because they determine whether any non\u2011standard language features or compiler extensions are being relied upon:\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t\n  - Reason: The structure definition (types of its members Name, Module and Address) is required. In particular, the type of Address is crucial to judge the cast (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address for use of non\u2011standard pointer/integer casts or exotic pointer-to-function representations which could be a compiler extension.\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n  - Reason: Knowing whether this symbol is an array, pointer to an array, or produced via some compiler/linker extension (e.g. placed in a special section, generated by linker script, or defined via non\u2011standard attributes) is necessary to determine if the code depends on non\u2011standard behavior (pointer arithmetic, sentinel entry usage, or section/linker tricks).\n\n- cpuaddr\n  - Reason: The typedef/definition of cpuaddr must be examined to ensure it is a standard integer type (e.g. uintptr_t) and not a compiler\u2011specific extended type. This affects whether the cast (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address is standard C or relies on an extension.\n\n- int32\n  - Reason: The exact typedef or macro behind int32 is needed to confirm it maps to a standard integer type and not to a compiler extension type.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS\n  - Reason: These macros/enum values should be checked to confirm they are plain integer constants (standard C) and not implemented via compiler extensions (e.g. special attributes, non\u2011standard enums, or non\u2011portable constant expressions).\n\n- strcmp\n  - Reason: The prototype/availability of strcmp (from <string.h>) should be verified to confirm standard library usage. If a project provides a non\u2011standard replacement with extensions, that could change the analysis.\n\n- NULL\n  - Reason: The definition of NULL in the build environment (macro/type) should be standard. Some compilers provide non\u2011standard NULL definitions which could be considered an extension under strict MISRA checks.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions lets the analyst determine whether any casts, typedefs, macros or external symbols used by the function rely on documented compiler language extensions rather than strictly standard C."
