  "explanation": "I inspected the function for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp (including direct calls). No memcmp calls were found. The code uses strcmp to compare null-terminated strings (StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module vs. SymbolName/ModuleName), which is the intended string comparison function and not the memcmp forbidden by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The pointer NULL checks (StaticSym->Name == NULL and ModuleName == NULL) are explicit and not memcmp-based. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate or require investigation under Rule 21.14."
