  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The strcmp call is reachable when the loop reaches an entry with StaticSym != NULL and StaticSym->Name != NULL (the code checks for Name==NULL and breaks before calling strcmp). Therefore there is no unreachable code caused by the fragment. (Note: passing SymbolName==NULL would cause undefined behavior at runtime, but that is not an instance of unreachable code and thus not a Rule 2.1 violation.)"
