  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for the MISRA <string.h> bounds check\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t\n  - Needed to know the exact types of the fields (Name, Module, Address). If Name/Module are e.g. char arrays vs char * or const char *, this affects whether strcmp can legally access them and whether the code relies on a null-terminated buffer.\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n  - This global/extern pointer identifies where the code iterates. You must inspect this symbol to know whether the table is valid, how it is laid out, and whether the iteration and sentinel test (Name == NULL) are correct.\n\n- (the static symbol-table object/initializers referenced by OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE)\n  - The actual table contents (the array/initializer) show how Name and Module are populated. You must see the initializers to confirm that every non-sentinel entry has Name and Module pointing to valid, null-terminated storage (or explicitly NULL for Module where allowed).\n\n- storage backing the Name and Module strings in the static table (the char arrays / string literals)\n  - MISRA concerns accesses beyond object bounds; to prove strcmp is safe you must confirm the pointed-to objects are properly terminated and big enough. That requires the actual memory objects (string literals or char arrays) that Name/Module point to.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup (implementation)\n  - This caller supplies the SymbolName argument. You must inspect it to determine whether it ever calls OS_SymbolLookup_Static with SymbolName == NULL or with a possibly invalid/dangling pointer. If callers guarantee SymbolName non-NULL and valid, the strcmp usage is safer.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup (implementation)\n  - This caller supplies SymbolName and ModuleName. You must check whether it can pass a NULL or invalid ModuleName (the target function calls strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) when ModuleName != NULL). Also check whether it validates SymbolName before delegating.\n\n- strcmp (declaration / spec from <string.h>)\n  - To apply the MISRA rule you must use the standard semantics: strcmp requires both pointers to be non-NULL and to refer to NUL-terminated char sequences. Explicitly referencing the standard behavior clarifies the preconditions that must be met by the pointers passed by this code.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef)\n  - Although not directly a string function, knowing cpuaddr (width/representation) helps confirm casts from StaticSym->Address to cpuaddr do not alias or modify the memory backing the string objects (relevant when reasoning about object lifetimes and pointer provenance).\n\n- int32 (typedef)\n  - For completeness when analyzing call sites and return codes; not directly about string bounds but useful to inspect caller behavior and validate preconditions.\n\nSummary of what to inspect with these symbols\n- Confirm Name != NULL sentinel usage and that every non-sentinel entry has Name pointing to a valid NUL-terminated object.\n- Confirm Module pointers are valid (or NULL) for entries that may be compared when ModuleName != NULL.\n- Confirm callers (OS_SymbolLookup, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup) do not pass NULL or otherwise invalid SymbolName/ModuleName into this function.\n- Use the strcmp contract to determine whether any of the above cases would lead to out-of-bounds or dereference of invalid pointers, which would violate the MISRA rule."
