  "scenario": "If a table entry has StaticSym->Module == NULL but the caller supplies a non-NULL ModuleName, the expression strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) will be evaluated. This passes a NULL pointer as the first argument to strcmp, causing an access beyond the bounds of the referenced object (undefined behavior). Therefore the use of strcmp here can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
