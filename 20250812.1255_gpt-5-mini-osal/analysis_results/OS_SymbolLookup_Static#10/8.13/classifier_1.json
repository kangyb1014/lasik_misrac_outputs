  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: OS_static_symbol_record_t is typedef'd as a const struct, so StaticSym is a pointer to a const-qualified object. Therefore StaticSym->Address has the pointer-to-function member effectively const-qualified (void (* const)(void)) and the code merely reads that value and casts it to cpuaddr for assignment. If the typedef were not const (i.e., the struct and its Address member were not const-qualified), then making Address const (or the struct const) would be required to satisfy Rule 8.13."
