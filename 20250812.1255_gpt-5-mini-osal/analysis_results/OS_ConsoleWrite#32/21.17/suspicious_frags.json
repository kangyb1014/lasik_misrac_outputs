  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code. Therefore there are no direct call sites that would fall under Rule 21.17 to flag for investigation.\n\nReasons other fragments were not selected:\n- OS_Console_CopyOut: This routine performs a manual byte-by-byte copy using pointer dereference and explicit index arithmetic rather than any <string.h> function. Its write side appears protected: it checks and wraps WriteOffset against console->BufSize and tests for WriteOffset == console->ReadPos to detect full buffer before reporting OS_QUEUE_FULL, so it does not itself call a string.h routine that could overflow the destination buffer. Note: OS_Console_CopyOut does read the source bytes until it encounters a NUL terminator; that means a non-NUL-terminated source could cause a read past the source object\u2019s bounds, but this is not a use of a <string.h> function and thus is outside the strict scope of Rule 21.17.\n- Calls to OS_Console_CopyOut (from OS_ConsoleWrite) and passing console->device_name or msg_buffer: These calls do not invoke any string.h functions. OS_printf ensures msg_buffer is NUL-terminated (using vsnprintf and explicit termination) before passing it to OS_ConsoleWrite. console->device_name usage depends on that array being NUL-terminated elsewhere; again, this is not a string.h call.\n- OS_printf: Uses vsnprintf (from <stdio.h>), not a <string.h> function. The code bounds the result and explicitly NUL-terminates msg_buffer before passing it on, so there is no <string.h> usage to inspect for Rule 21.17 here.\n- Other helper/object-management routines shown (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, token handling, etc.) contain no <string.h> calls.\n\nIf you want checks beyond the narrow scope of Rule 21.17 (for example, manual string traversal that could read past a source buffer if not NUL-terminated), I can mark OS_Console_CopyOut and the places that supply its Str argument (console->device_name and callers that build those strings) as suspicious and produce fragments for deeper review. As required by Rule 21.17, however, there are no uses of the relevant <string.h> functions in the supplied code to report."
