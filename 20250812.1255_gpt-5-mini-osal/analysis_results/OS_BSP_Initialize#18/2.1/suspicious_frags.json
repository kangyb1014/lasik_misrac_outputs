  "explanation": "Only the three if-blocks shown above were flagged for investigation. All other code in OS_BSP_Initialize is either plainly reachable or conditional on runtime state and therefore does not indicate statically unreachable code:\n\n- The initial geteuid() check and the nested fopen/fgets/strtoul sequence are runtime-dependent (may or may not execute depending on the effective UID and file presence) and so are not statically unreachable.\n- The variable declarations, buffer usage, and assignments (including the calls that set status) are executed sequentially and are reachable at runtime.\n- The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined as an empty macro in the provided additional code; its invocations compile away to no-ops but do not introduce other unreachable code fragments beyond the ones already listed.\n- There are no other unconditional return/goto/loop constructs or dead labels that would produce additional unreachable code in the shown function.\n\nTherefore, no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided code."
