  "explanation": "I found no instances of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. In particular:\n- There are no uses of compiler builtins or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, #pragma GCC, or other vendor-specific tokens.\n- The BSP_DEBUG macro uses a variadic macro form (BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)); variadic macros are part of standard C99/C11 and are not a vendor extension by themselves.\n- All types and functions used (FILE, fopen, fgets, strtoul, pthread_* types and functions, geteuid, strerror) are standard C or POSIX library APIs, not compiler language extensions.\n- The OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C cast macro is a plain cast macro, not an extension.\n- No nonstandard keywords or constructs (inline assembly, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, extended integer types, etc.) are present.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
