The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Initialize:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Initialize(void)\n{\n    FILE *              fp;\n    char                buffer[32];\n    pthread_mutexattr_t mutex_attr;\n    int                 status;\n\n    /*\n     * If not running as root, check /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max\n     *\n     * This special file represents the max depth of a POSIX message queue for an unprivileged user.\n     *\n     * In order to facilitate running in simulation mode without any need for root access --\n     * this will allow the OSAL to successfully create message queues by truncating anything larger than this size.\n     *\n     * No need to check _LINUX_OS_ here; if the file fails to open, i.e. if not on Linux and the file does not exist,\n     * then leave well enough alone and don't do anything.\n     */\n    if (geteuid() != 0)\n    {\n        fp = fopen(\"/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max\", \"r\");\n        if (fp)\n        {\n            if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp) != NULL)\n            {\n                OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(strtoul(buffer, NULL, 10));\n                BSP_DEBUG(\"Maximum user msg queue depth = %u\\n\", (unsigned int)OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth);\n            }\n            fclose(fp);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Initialize the low level access mutex (w/priority inheritance) */\n    status = pthread_mutexattr_init(&mutex_attr);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutexattr_init: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    status = pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(&mutex_attr, PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    status = pthread_mutex_init(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex, &mutex_attr);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_init: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_Initialize:\nextern OS_BSP_GlobalData_t OS_BSP_Global\n...\n#define OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(X) ((osal_blockcount_t)(X))\n...\n#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined empty, so the if-body contains no effective operations. The compiled code becomes effectively 'if (status < 0) { }' \u2014 the only executed operation is the conditional test which has no side effects. Removing the if and its empty body would not change program behaviour (other than potential minor timing differences), so the logging call constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
