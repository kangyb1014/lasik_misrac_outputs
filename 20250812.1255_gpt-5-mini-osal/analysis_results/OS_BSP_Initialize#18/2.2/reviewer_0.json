The compiled code becomes effectively 'if (status < 0) { }' \u2014 the only executed operation is the conditional test which has no side effects. Removing the if and its empty body would not change program behaviour (other than potential minor timing differences), so the logging call constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Note 1 to that rule explicitly states that the behaviour of an embedded system can depend on timing, so changes that affect timing are considered behavioural changes. In the posted code, if BSP_DEBUG expands to nothing the logging call itself has no effect, but the surrounding conditional test if (status < 0) is still executed. Removing the if (and its empty body) would remove that executed conditional test and thus could change the program's timing (and would remove the read of status, which could matter if status were volatile). Because removing the conditional/test can change observable behaviour (timing/control-flow/reads), the logging construct cannot be judged as dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. Therefore the violation report is incorrect."
