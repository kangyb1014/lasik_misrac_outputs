  "explanation": "You must inspect any user-defined macros/functions and globals referenced by OS_BSP_Initialize to ensure none expand or call memcmp on null-terminated strings. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG: Likely a macro or logging function; could expand to code that compares or formats strings (possibly using memcmp). Must check its definition/expansion for any memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: A macro or inline conversion helper used on the parsed string result; its definition may include string comparisons or helpers that could call memcmp. Verify it does not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n- OS_BSP_Global: Global structure referenced (MaxQueueDepth). Its type or accessors might involve functions/macros that perform string comparisons; inspect to ensure no memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: Global structure whose AccessMutex is initialized; its type or related init helpers might call functions that use memcmp \u2014 check definitions.\n- fopen, fgets, fclose: Standard I/O functions called on \"/proc/...\" and buffer; while standard library implementations rarely violate MISRA, include them so the analyser can confirm no user-provided wrappers (or platform-specific implementations) use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n- strtoul: Parses the buffer; include to ensure no wrapper implementation uses memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n- strerror: Used in debug messages; include to check for wrappers that might use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n- geteuid: Used to gate the file read; include in case of platform wrapper that could involve string comparisons.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init, PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: POSIX threading calls/constants used here; include to confirm there are no local wrapper implementations that internally use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nIn short, focus first on user-defined macros and global objects (BSP_DEBUG, OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C, OS_BSP_Global, OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal). The remaining standard-library and POSIX symbols are included only to verify there are no project-specific wrappers that might call memcmp on null-terminated strings."
