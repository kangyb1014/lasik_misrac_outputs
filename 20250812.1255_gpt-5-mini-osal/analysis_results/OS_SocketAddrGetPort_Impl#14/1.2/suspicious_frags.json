  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Items inspected and reasons they are not MISRA Rule 1.2 violations: \n- No compiler-specific keywords or constructs (for example, no __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, or other vendor-specific extensions) are present.\n- The use of #ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is standard preprocessor conditional compilation, not a language extension (the macro itself is a feature toggle, not a compiler extension).\n- Standard POSIX/network types and functions (in_port_t, struct sockaddr*, ntohs, AF_INET/AF_INET6) are library/OS types and APIs, not compiler language extensions. If these types were considered non-standard in a particular compiler, that would be documented by the compiler vendor, but nothing here is a compiler extension syntax.\n- The pointer cast (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData and the union OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t usage are standard C constructs (note: they may raise other MISRA concerns such as aliasing or type-punning, but those are not language-extension issues under Rule 1.2).\n- Use of fixed-width integer typedefs (uint16_t, int32_t) and macros for constants is standard C.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that use explicit compiler language extensions that would trigger Rule 1.2 reporting."
