  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). Therefore there are no code fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in this function. The pointer casts and member accesses (casting Addr->AddrData to an accessor and reading sa_family/port fields) are not string handling calls and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17; any bounds or aliasing concerns related to those accesses are not relevant to this specific rule and would need to be evaluated under other MISRA rules if required."
