Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Most of the remaining code implements necessary control flow, initialization, or API-level checks and therefore does not appear to be dead code: - The assignment Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData; is used later to select the address family and extract the port. - The AF_INET case and its break are required to set sa_port for IPv4 addresses. - The final assignment *PortNum = ntohs(sa_port); and the return OS_SUCCESS; are required for normal operation. - The wrapper OS_SocketAddrGetPort performs pointer checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER) before calling the Impl function; those checks are active runtime behavior, not dead code. - OS_CreateSocketName uses the port and name formatting (snprintf, OS_strnlen) in ways that affect runtime output; these are not dead. The two fragments listed above are included for investigation because they are either conditionally compiled (the AF_INET6 block depending on OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6) or contain an unreachable/redundant statement (the break after return in the default branch). No other lines in the provided snippets are redundant assignments or operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
