  "explanation": "I examined the provided function OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl and the related type/constant definitions. There are no calls to memcmp, no other standard-library string-comparison functions, and no code that compares null-terminated strings via raw memory comparison in the supplied snippets. The function only accesses sockaddr fields and calls ntohs to convert the port \u2014 this is not a string comparison. The union contains a char data[] member, but there is no usage in the snippets that compares its contents with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp usage exists elsewhere, it is not present in the given code and would need to be inspected separately.)"
