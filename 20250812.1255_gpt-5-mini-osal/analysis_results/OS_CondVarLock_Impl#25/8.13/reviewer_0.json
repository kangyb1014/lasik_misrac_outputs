The macro expands &(tok) \u2192 &(*token) which yields a pointer of type const OS_object_token_t *. If the function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t * (or otherwise accepts a non-const pointer), this will discard the const qualification and therefore violates the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstruct OS_impl_condvar_internal_record;\nstatic void log_probe(const char *stage, const void *token_ptr,\n                      const struct OS_impl_condvar_internal_record *impl, int status)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/203.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* best-effort logging only */\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_CondVarLock_Impl] stage=%s\\n\", stage);\n    fprintf(f, \"  token_ptr=%p\\n\", token_ptr);\n\n    if (token_ptr != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Produce a numeric representation from the token bytes (width-agnostic).\n         * This mirrors the idea of treating the token object as an integer index\n         * without relying on its precise compile-time type. */\n        unsigned long long token_value = 0ULL;\n        size_t copy_n = sizeof(token_value);\n\n        /* Copy as many bytes as available from the token object up to the\n         * width of token_value.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Summary: The claim is plausible but not proven from the snippet alone, so the report as stated is not correct.\n\nReasoning:\n- MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns const-correctness of pointers (i.e. pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible). A true violation would require that a const-qualified object\u2019s address is passed to or assigned to a non-const pointer (i.e. discarding const qualification).\n- The code you provided does not itself discard const. The function parameter is declared const OS_object_token_t *token and the function uses the expression *token. That yields an lvalue of type const OS_object_token_t. Whether a const qualification is discarded depends entirely on the expansion of the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and on the signature of any function(s) it calls (for example, any OS_ObjectIndexFromToken used inside the macro).\n- If OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands so that it takes the address of the token expression (e.g. &(*token)) and then passes that address to a function declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t *, then that would indeed discard const and be a violation (and also a constraint violation in standard C unless an explicit cast is used). But that is a problem in the macro/function declarations, not in the code snippet you showed by itself.\n- The test code agent A supplied failed to compile, which is consistent with a prototype/const-mismatch, but that compilation failure is evidence of a mismatch in their test environment, not definitive proof that the real project\u2019s OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are non-const-correct.\n\nConclusion: Agent A\u2019s scenario describes a real possible way to violate MISRA 8.13, but the provided snippet alone does not show the violation \u2014 the macro and any called function prototypes must be inspected. Without those definitions, the report cannot be confirmed. Therefore the report as stated is not correct (not proven)."
