  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nWhen the macro is used as in OS_CondVarLock_Impl: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token) where token has type const OS_object_token_t *. The macro expands &(tok) \u2192 &(*token) which yields a pointer of type const OS_object_token_t *. If the function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a non-const OS_object_token_t * (or otherwise accepts a non-const pointer), this will discard the const qualification and therefore violates the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible).\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_CondVarLock_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/203.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_CondVarLock_Impl as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarLock_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarLock_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut);\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_CondVarLock_Impl code.\n",
