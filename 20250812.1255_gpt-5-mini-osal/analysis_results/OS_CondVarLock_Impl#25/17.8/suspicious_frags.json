  "explanation": "The only function parameter is 'token' (const OS_object_token_t *). In the code it is only dereferenced to read its value in the call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET; there are no assignments to 'token' itself, no increments, and no operations that would modify the pointer. The local variable 'impl' is assigned and used, and pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut) modifies the mutex object pointed to by 'impl' \u2014 but 'impl' is a local variable, not a function parameter, and modifying the object referred to by a (non-parameter) pointer is allowed. There are no other parameters in this function to consider, and no operations that modify any function parameter, so no code fragments require further investigation under Rule 17.8."
