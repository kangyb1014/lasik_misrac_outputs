  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages were found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so the pointer already points to a const-qualified type as recommended.\n- The local variable impl is declared as OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t * and is used to obtain the address of impl->id which is passed to pthread_mutex_lock. Locking the mutex modifies the mutex object, so impl must point to a mutable object; qualifying it as pointer-to-const would be inappropriate and prevent the required mutation.\n- The expression &(impl->id) yields a pthread_mutex_t * passed to pthread_mutex_lock, which expects a non-const pointer; thus it cannot be const-qualified.\n- No other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions are present in the function body that could reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for violation of Rule 8.13."
