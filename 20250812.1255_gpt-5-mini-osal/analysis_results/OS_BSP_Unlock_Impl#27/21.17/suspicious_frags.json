  "suspicious_frags": [
    "status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);",
    "if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }"
  ],
  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> library-related function in this snippet is strerror(...) inside the BSP_DEBUG call and the code that determines which value is passed to it. Those fragments should be investigated because strerror may index into an internal error-message table and can exhibit out-of-bounds or undefined behavior for invalid/negative/large errnum values depending on the implementation. Other parts of the function do not call any <string.h> functions or perform operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses tied to string handling: the variable declaration, the pthread_setcancelstate(...) call, and the surrounding control flow do not involve string.h APIs and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 21.17."
