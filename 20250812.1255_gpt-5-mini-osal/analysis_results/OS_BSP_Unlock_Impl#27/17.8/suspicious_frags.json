  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl (prototype: void OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)). The only local variable is 'status' (an int), which is not a function parameter and thus not subject to Rule 17.8.\n\nCalls in the function do pass pointers, but none of these involve modifying a function parameter in this function:\n- pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex): this passes the address of a global object. The rule refers to modifying a function parameter; taking the address of a global and passing it to a library call does not modify any parameter of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl. The object pointed to may be modified by the callee (allowed by the rule).\n- strerror(status): passes an int by value \u2014 value parameters are copies and not modified as function parameters here.\n- pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL): the first argument is an int passed by value; the second argument is NULL, so no pointer parameter of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl is being modified.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or potentially violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8; nothing needs further investigation under that rule."
