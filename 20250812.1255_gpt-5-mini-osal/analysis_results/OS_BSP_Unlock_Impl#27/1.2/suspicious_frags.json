  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragments. The code calls POSIX pthread APIs (pthread_mutex_unlock, pthread_setcancelstate) and uses strerror/NULL \u2014 these are library/API usages, not language/compiler extensions. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, asm (inline assembly), typeof, named/unnamed compiler pragmas, extended integer types, or other documented compiler-only extensions. The BSP_DEBUG macro shown uses __VA_ARGS__, which is a standard C (C99) variadic macro feature rather than a compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that should be reported for MI SRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
