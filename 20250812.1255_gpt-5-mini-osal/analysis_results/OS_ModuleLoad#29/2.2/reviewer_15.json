In all execution paths where the value is later read (return_code == OS_SUCCESS), SysMountPointLen is overwritten with OS_strnlen(filesys->system_mountpt, ...) after a successful OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch and filesys->flags indicates a mounted system. In the paths where it is not overwritten, the function does not reach the later code that would use SysMountPointLen (because return_code != OS_SUCCESS). Therefore removing the assignment would not change program behaviour, so it is dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/234.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_ModuleLoad(osal_id_t *module_id, const char *module_name, const char *filename, uint32 flags)\n{\n    char                         translated_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    int32                        return_code;\n    int32                        filename_status;\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    OS_module_internal_record_t *module;\n\n    /* Log entry and inputs */\n    probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad ENTRY: module_name='%s' filename='%s' flags=%u\",\n              module_name ? module_name : \"(null)\", filename ? filename : \"(null)\", (unsigned)flags);\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"filename\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly\n     * null.  filename is checked for NULL-ness by the OS_TranslatePath() later.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(module_id);\n    OS_CHECK_APINAME(module_name);\n\n    /*\n     * Preemptively translate the filename, and hold it in a temporary buffer.\n     *\n     * This should be done before allocating a new object ID because it also\n     * locks the global table, and this prevents double-locking.\n     *\n     * The status of this operation is stored separately, because it may or\n     * may not be relevant, depending on whether the static module table is enabled.\n     */\n    filename_status = OS_TranslatePath(filename, translated_path);\n\n    /* Log translate results relevant to the violation scenario */\n    probe_log(\"OS_TranslatePath returned filename_status=%ld translated_path='%s'\",\n              (long)filename_status, translated_path[0] ? translated_path : \"(empty)\");\n\n    /* Note - the common ObjectIdAllocate routine will lock the object type and leave it locked. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, module_name, &token);\n    probe_log(\"OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew returned return_code=%ld\", (long)return_code);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        module = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_module_table, token);\n\n        /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n        OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, module, module_name, module_name);\n\n        module->flags = flags; /* save user-supplied flags */\n\n        probe_log(\"After init: module->flags=%u\", (unsigned)module->flags);\n\n        /*\n         * Check the statically-linked module list.\n         * If a matching entry is found, this means its\n         * already effectively \"loaded\" through static linkage.\n         * Return success without any more action.\n         *\n         * If the OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_STATIC_LOADER feature is disabled,\n         * then the list of static modules is empty and this always\n         * returns OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ModuleLoad_Static(module_name);\n        probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Static returned %ld\", (long)return_code);\n\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            /* mark this as a statically loaded module */\n            module->module_type = OS_MODULE_TYPE_STATIC;\n            probe_log(\"Module marked as STATIC: module_type=%d\", (int)module->module_type);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * If this is NOT a static module, then the module file must be loaded by normal\n             * means using the dynamic loader, if available.

  "explanation": "Not correct. The agent\u2019s claim rests on an unproven assumption about code in OS_TranslatePath (the SysMountPointLen = 0 assignment) and on an incomplete dynamic test that didn\u2019t exercise the function. To show a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code) you must demonstrate that an operation is executed and that removing it cannot affect program behaviour in any execution. The evidence provided does not establish that:\n\n- The OS_TranslatePath implementation that contains the assignment was not supplied, so we cannot confirm where SysMountPointLen is read, whether it can be observed later, or whether the assignment has any side effects (for example protecting against an uninitialized read, affecting timing, or being observed by other code or threads).\n- The modified test driver produced no log output for OS_ModuleLoad, so it does not exercise the relevant paths and provides no runtime proof that the assignment is redundant.\n- A whole-program/flow-sensitive analysis is needed to prove dead code: all uses of the variable, all control-flow paths, possible interactions with other modules, and any dependence on timing or side effects must be considered.\n\nTherefore, based on the material provided, the report that OS_ModuleLoad (via OS_TranslatePath) violates Rule 2.2 is not supported. To substantiate the claim, provide the OS_TranslatePath source, a complete list of all reads of the variable, or a proof that in every execution where the assignment executes its removal cannot change program behaviour."
