  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ModuleLoad:\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleLoad(osal_id_t *module_id, const char *module_name, const char *filename, uint32 flags)\n{\n    char                         translated_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    int32                        return_code;\n    int32                        filename_status;\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    OS_module_internal_record_t *module;\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"filename\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly\n     * null.  filename is checked for NULL-ness by the OS_TranslatePath() later.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(module_id);\n    OS_CHECK_APINAME(module_name);\n\n    /*\n     * Preemptively translate the filename, and hold it in a temporary buffer.\n     *\n     * This should be done before allocating a new object ID because it also\n     * locks the global table, and this prevents double-locking.\n     *\n     * The status of this operation is stored separately, because it may or\n     * may not be relevant, depending on whether the static module table is enabled.\n     */\n    filename_status = OS_TranslatePath(filename, translated_path);\n\n    /* Note - the common ObjectIdAllocate routine will lock the object type and leave it locked. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, module_name, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        module = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_module_table, token);\n\n        /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n        OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, module, module_name, module_name);\n\n        module->flags = flags; /* save user-supplied flags */\n\n        /*\n         * Check the statically-linked module list.\n         * If a matching entry is found, this means its\n         * already effectively \"loaded\" through static linkage.\n         * Return success without any more action.\n         *\n         * If the OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_STATIC_LOADER feature is disabled,\n         * then the list of static modules is empty and this always\n         * returns OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ModuleLoad_Static(module_name);\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            /* mark this as a statically loaded module */\n            module->module_type = OS_MODULE_TYPE_STATIC;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * If this is NOT a static module, then the module file must be loaded by normal\n             * means using the dynamic loader, if available.
