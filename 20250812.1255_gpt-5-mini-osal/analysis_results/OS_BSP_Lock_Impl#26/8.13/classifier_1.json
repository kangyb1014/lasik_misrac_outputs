  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code fragment only passes the return value of strerror(status) (a library function returning char *) to a debug macro; there is no local pointer declaration that should have been const-qualified. The strerror prototype is from the C library and is not const-qualified by definition, and BSP_DEBUG is defined away. Therefore this usage does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the return value were stored in a local pointer, declaring it as const char * would be recommended, but that is not done here.)"
