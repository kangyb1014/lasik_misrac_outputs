  "explanation": "OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal \u2014 need the global variable/struct definition to confirm that the code is taking addresses of global members (not of a function parameter) and to inspect member types.\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex \u2014 must know the exact type of this member (e.g. pthread_mutex_t vs pointer) to verify that the expression &AccessMutex produces a pointer to the object (allowed to be modified by callee) and not accidentally modifying a pointer parameter.\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState \u2014 must know this member's type (likely int) so that passing &AccessCancelState to pthread_setcancelstate is seen as passing a pointer to an object that the callee may modify (permitted by MISRA) rather than modifying a function parameter.\npthread_mutex_lock \u2014 need the function prototype (signature) to confirm its parameter is a pointer to the mutex object and that the callee will modify the pointed-to object (allowed) and does not attempt to modify any parameter passed to OS_BSP_Lock_Impl itself.\npthread_setcancelstate \u2014 need the prototype (int, int *) to confirm the second parameter is an out-pointer (callee modifies pointed object) and that no pointer parameter of OS_BSP_Lock_Impl is being modified.\npthread_mutex_t \u2014 the concrete type of the mutex member matters to ensure address-of yields the expected pointer type and to rule out inadvertent pointer/pointer-to-pointer semantics that could imply modifying a parameter.\nPTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE \u2014 its definition/value to confirm correct usage as a non-pointer argument (not relevant to modifying parameters but required to fully understand the call).\nstrerror \u2014 prototype to confirm it takes an int error number (value) and returns a string pointer; ensures the call strerror(status) does not involve modifying any function parameter of OS_BSP_Lock_Impl.\nBSP_DEBUG \u2014 the macro/function definition used for logging to ensure the expansion/callee does not itself modify any parameter of OS_BSP_Lock_Impl (there are none) or otherwise change semantics relevant to the rule.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine that OS_BSP_Lock_Impl has no formal parameters to be modified, that only addresses of global members are passed to callees (allowed to modify the pointed-to objects), and that no pointer parameter of this function is being reassigned or altered \u2014 thus enabling a correct MISRA C parameter-modification assessment."
