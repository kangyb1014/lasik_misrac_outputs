  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for compiler language extensions:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro definition): The macro expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not use compiler-specific extensions (e.g., GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), ##__VA_ARGS__ before it was standardized, attributes, asm, or other non\u2011standard constructs). If BSP_DEBUG is defined with any such extensions, the target function would violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (declaration and struct/type definition): The global object\u2019s definition may use non-standard language extensions (e.g., anonymous structs/unions, bit-field types with implementation-defined widths, GCC/clang attributes, or other extensions). Its definition also provides the types of its members.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex (member declaration/type): Knowing the exact type (typically pthread_mutex_t) and how it is declared lets you check whether that type or its declaration uses any compiler extensions (typedefs, attributes, macros that expand to extensions).\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState (member declaration/type): The member\u2019s type must be verified (expected int or similar) and its declaration inspected for any non\u2011standard annotations or extensions that could make the call to pthread_setcancelstate invoke or require extensions.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (declaration/prototype from <pthread.h>): The prototype and any associated macros/inline wrappers must be checked for use of compiler extensions (e.g., inline asm, attribute macros, GCC builtins) that would make the call site depend on non\u2011standard language features.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate (declaration/prototype from <pthread.h>): Same as above \u2014 inspect the declaration/wrapper for attributes or compiler-specific constructs. Also confirm parameter types to check that the address-of AccessCancelState is correct without hidden casts or extensions.\n\n- PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE (macro/constant from <pthread.h>): The macro expansion should be checked to ensure it is a plain integer constant and does not use any compiler extensions.\n\n- strerror (declaration/prototype from <string.h>): Inspect the declaration/wrapper for any non-standard constructs or macro wrappers that could be compiler-specific extensions.\n\nRationale summary: To determine whether the target function uses language/compiler extensions you must examine the actual macro/typedef/function definitions and the global object layout referenced by the function. Any extension could be hidden in macro expansions, type definitions, or header-provided wrappers (not visible in the function body), so those symbol definitions are necessary for a conclusive MISRA C (language extensions) analysis."
