  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and found no uses of the C Standard Library function memcmp nor any other memory-comparison operations being used to compare null-terminated strings. The only string-related call is strerror(status) inside BSP_DEBUG, which obtains an error description; this does not perform a memcmp on C-strings. The other calls (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_setcancelstate) do not compare strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
