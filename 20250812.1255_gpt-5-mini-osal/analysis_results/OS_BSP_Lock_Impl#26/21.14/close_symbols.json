  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_Lock_Impl violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any code that executes as part of the function (directly or via macros) to see if memcmp is used erroneously. The required symbols and why:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro) -- definition/expansion: BSP_DEBUG is invoked in the error path. If the macro expands to code or calls helpers that use memcmp on C strings this would constitute a violation reachable from OS_BSP_Lock_Impl. You must examine the macro body and any inlined code.\n\n- strerror: The function call strerror(status) is passed to BSP_DEBUG. Although standard strerror normally does not use memcmp for string comparison, implementations vary; inspect its implementation (or wrapper) to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings in this build.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: Present for completeness \u2014 although POSIX pthread functions do not normally use memcmp for string comparison, a project-specific wrapper or stub could. Include it to rule out indirect use of memcmp.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate: Same rationale as pthread_mutex_lock \u2014 include the symbol (or wrapper) to ensure no indirect memcmp usage occurs via project-specific implementations.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (struct/type) including fields AccessMutex and AccessCancelState: Knowing the types can reveal if any user-defined operator or accessor macros are invoked (via these symbols) that may call functions using memcmp. Also needed to inspect any associated accessor macros or inline functions.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl (implementation called/used by BSP_DEBUG, if applicable): BSP_DEBUG often routes messages to console output; if BSP_DEBUG forwards text to this implementation, that code must be inspected for memcmp misuse.\n\n- printf / vfprintf / OS_printf (any concrete output routine used by BSP_DEBUG): If BSP_DEBUG expands to a call to standard or project logging/formatting routines, inspect those routines for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nIn short: inspect BSP_DEBUG and every function it calls (and the implementations/wrappers of the library calls in this translation unit) because the MISRA rule would be violated only if memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings in code that is executed by or reachable from OS_BSP_Lock_Impl."
