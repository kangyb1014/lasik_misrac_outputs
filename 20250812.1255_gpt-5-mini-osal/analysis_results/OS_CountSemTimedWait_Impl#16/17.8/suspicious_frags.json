  "explanation": "No parameter of OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl is modified in the shown code. Reasoning:\n- The function parameters are: const OS_object_token_t *token and uint32 msecs. There are no assignments to token or msecs anywhere in the function body.\n- The use impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) passes *token to a macro that takes the address of that argument (&(tok)) \u2014 with *token this becomes &(*token) which is the original token pointer; this takes the address but does not modify the token parameter itself. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const pointer and only reads token->obj_idx.\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime receives msecs by value (a copy) and modifies the timespec pointed to by &ts; modifying an object referred to by a pointer parameter (tm) is permitted by the rule, and ts is a local variable, not a function parameter.\n- sem_timedwait(&impl->id, &ts) operates on the semaphore and the local timespec; it does not modify the function parameters.\n- No other code fragments assign to or otherwise alter the value of any function parameter.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
