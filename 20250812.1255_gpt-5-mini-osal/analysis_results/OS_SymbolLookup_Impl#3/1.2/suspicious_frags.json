  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. The fragment only uses standard C constructs: typedefs based on standard stdint types (uintptr_t, int32_t), function declaration/definition, pointer and const qualifiers, macros (NULL and integer macro OS_SUCCESS), a while loop, break, and simple struct/member usage. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm__/__asm__, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values (computed goto), built-in compiler intrinsics, pragma directives that are compiler-specific, or other documented compiler extensions. The macro OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE being defined as NULL is a standard C macro usage, not an extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
