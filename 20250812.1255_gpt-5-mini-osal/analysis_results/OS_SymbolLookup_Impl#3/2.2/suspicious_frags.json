  "explanation": "I reported fragments that are candidates for dead code (operations executed but possibly removable without affecting externally observable behavior) so they can be investigated further. Reasons why other parts do NOT need investigation for dead code: \n\n- The initial assignment of status = OS_ERROR and the status = OS_SUCCESS path are integral to the function return semantics; removing them would change return values and therefore behaviour.\n- The call to dlerror() before dlsym() is a deliberate side-effect to clear prior errors and is necessary to reliably detect lookup failures on POSIX-like systems.\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive / OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit sequence (setting iter->match, iter->arg, iter->limit, iter->base and calling OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit) performs iterator initialization and potential locking; those operations have observable side-effects (locking / table base/limits) and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel (called by the iterator destroy) performs unlock operations when a transaction lock was taken; that has side-effects on concurrency and must not be removed.\n- The assignment/return in OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (calling OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl and returning status) is functional and required for propagation of result.\n\nThe fragments I selected are worthy of inspection because they include logging branches and assignments whose removal might not change functional results (e.g. debug-only calls, writing the SymbolAddress even on error, iterator token clearing or index increment logic). These should be reviewed in context (build-time logging configuration, callers' expectations about SymbolAddress on error, initial iterator token/index values) to determine whether they are actually dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2."
