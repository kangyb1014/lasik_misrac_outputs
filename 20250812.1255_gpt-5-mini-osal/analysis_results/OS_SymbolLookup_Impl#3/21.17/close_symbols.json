  "explanation": "To determine if OS_SymbolLookup_Impl can cause out-of-bounds accesses via <string.h> functions you must examine any called code that receives or manipulates the SymbolName/SymbolAddress or the iterator/token buffers and any related macros/types:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee that receives SymbolName and SymbolAddress. It is the most likely place to call string functions (strcmp, strcpy, strlen, memcpy, etc.). Inspect its implementation to see whether it bounds-checks buffers and how it handles SymbolName.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Called for per-module lookups and also calls OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. Its implementation may copy/compare symbol names or build temporary buffers; must be reviewed for string operations and bounds checks.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. It may extract object names/indices from tokens or manipulate strings; include to trace any string usage originating from the token.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Initializes the iterator used in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl. It may set up iterator internal buffers or token contents that are later passed to ModuleSymbolLookup. If it writes into iterator buffers, those writes must be inspected for bounds safety.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: (callee of OS_ObjectIdIterateActive per call graph) Include to see exact initialization logic and any string/buffer operations performed on iterator/token fields.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Cleanup function called after iteration; may interact with iterator internals or transaction logic that touches buffers. Include to ensure no deferred string ops affect safety analysis.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: (callee of Destroy) May access or modify iterator/token internals; include to fully understand lifecycle and any string operations on those buffers.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (definition and layout): OS_SymbolLookup_Impl takes &iter.token to ModuleSymbolLookup. You must know the size and layout of the iterator structure and the token field to determine whether any string operations can overflow its buffers.\n\n- type of iter.token (definition): The exact type and its internal buffer sizes (e.g., name arrays) are needed to judge whether passed pointers could cause out-of-bounds accesses in callees.\n\n- OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE: The constant passed to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl may change code paths inside that function (global vs module lookup); include to reproduce/control behavior when inspecting string ops.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Return-code macro used for logic flow. Knowing all return values and error paths is necessary to see which routines run and whether string functions are invoked on certain paths.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef): The type of SymbolAddress target. Understanding whether it is an integer, pointer-sized type or alias affects how memory/address results are stored and whether any string/memory functions operate on those buffers.\n\nCollecting these symbols (implementations, prototypes and type/layout definitions) lets the next analyst inspect every place strings or memory copies could be performed for potential out-of-bounds accesses, which is required to evaluate the cited MISRA C rule."
