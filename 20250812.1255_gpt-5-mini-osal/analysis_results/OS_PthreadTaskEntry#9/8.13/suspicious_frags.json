  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not appear relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible):\n- The local variable declaration \"OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;\" is not a pointer declaration and therefore not subject to the rule.\n- The call \"OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id);\" passes an integer/member (local_arg.id) rather than a pointer, so it is not relevant to pointer const-qualification.\n- The \"return NULL;\" statement returns the required pthread-style void * return value; changing the function return type to a const-qualified pointer would violate the pthread entry-point signature, so it is not a viable change to satisfy Rule 8.13.\n- The cppcheck comment is a comment and not code to be checked.\nThe two selected fragments should be investigated because the parameter \"void *arg\" and its direct assignment into local_arg.opaque_arg involve pointer types that may be candidates for const-qualification (unless constrained by the pthread API), so they warrant review to determine whether const can be applied or whether the non-const pointer is required."
