The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint (prototype + definition): The target function immediately calls OS_TaskEntryPoint and the MISRA rule states that the behaviour of any functions called within a loop body is part of the loop body. Even though OS_PthreadTaskEntry contains no for loop itself, any for loops that could affect compliance may be located inside OS_TaskEntryPoint. You must inspect its code to find any for statements and verify their three clauses, loop counters, and side effects.\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit (definitions): The static call graph shows these are callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint. For correct analysis you must inspect all functions invoked by OS_TaskEntryPoint because their behaviour may be part of a for-loop body (either directly containing loops or modifying objects used as loop counters/flags).\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (definition, including members 'id' and 'opaque_arg'): The target function constructs a local value of this type and passes local_arg.id to OS_TaskEntryPoint. You need the type layout to confirm what 'id' is, whether the union access has any side effects, and whether the passed value could be an object that is later used as or modifies a loop counter or loop-control flag in callees.\n\n- underlying type of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t.id (typedef / integer type): The MISRA rule restricts the nature of loop counters (e.g., integer types). If a callee uses the passed 'id' as a loop counter or loop-control flag, you must know its exact type to judge compliance (single loop counter, not modified in loop body, correct type, etc.).\n\n- all global objects referenced or modified by OS_TaskEntryPoint, OS_TaskPrepare, OS_TaskExit (declarations/definitions): The rule forbids using objects other than the loop counter (that are modified in the loop body) in the for second/third clauses. Globals modified or read by those functions could be used as loop counters or loop-control flags; you must identify them to check whether any for loops violate the rule.\n\n- all functions directly or transitively called by OS_TaskEntryPoint, OS_TaskPrepare, OS_TaskExit (prototypes and definitions): The behaviour of called functions is part of a for-loop body. To fully verify each for statement encountered you must inspect all transitive callees for side effects that could affect loop counters or control flags, or for additional for loops that must themselves be checked for well-formedness.\n\nIn summary: obtain the complete definitions (and relevant typedefs/globals) for OS_TaskEntryPoint and its transitive callees and the type of the value passed into them. Those symbols supply the code and object types needed to determine whether any for loops reachable from OS_PthreadTaskEntry satisfy the MISRA well-formedness constraints."
