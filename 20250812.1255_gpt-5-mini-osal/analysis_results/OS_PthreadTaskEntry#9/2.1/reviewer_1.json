In OS_PthreadTaskEntry the call OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id) is documented as \u201cNever returns\u201d, therefore the subsequent statement return NULL; is unreachable. Likewise, the fragment OS_TaskExit_Impl(); is documented as non\u2011returning so any code placed after that call would be unreachable. This situation violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void log_state(const char *stage, void *arg, unsigned long long id_val)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/73.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"%s: arg=%p id=%llu\\n\", stage, arg, id_val);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void *OS_PthreadTaskEntry(void *arg)\n{\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    local_arg.opaque_arg = arg;\n\n    /* Log state before calling the (documented) non-returning task entry point. */\n    {\n        /* Convert id to an integer-sized value for logging. This preserves original\n           logic and only probes state; it does not change behavior. */\n        unsigned long long id_val = (unsigned long long)(uintptr_t)local_arg.id;\n        log_state(\"OS_PthreadTaskEntry: before OS_TaskEntryPoint\", arg, id_val);\n    }\n\n    OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id); /* Never returns */\n\n    /* If execution reaches here, the documented non-return behavior did not occur.\n       Log that unexpected control path so the unreachable-code situation can be observed. */\n    {\n        unsigned long long id_val = (unsigned long long)(uintptr_t)local_arg.id;\n        log_state(\"OS_PthreadTaskEntry: returned from OS_TaskEntryPoint (unexpected)\", arg, id_val);\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_PthreadTaskEntry.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the code as shown. MISRA Rule 2.1 forbids unreachable code, but \u201cunreachable\u201d is a static property that must be demonstrable (e.g. via the function being declared as non\u2011returning). In the snippet supplied, OS_TaskEntryPoint is only described in documentation as \u201cNever returns\u201d \u2014 there is no evidence in the posted code that it is declared with _Noreturn or an equivalent noreturn attribute. A compiler/static analyser therefore must treat the call as potentially returning, so the subsequent return NULL; is not statically unreachable. The empty test log does not prove unreachable code at compile time; it only shows the test didn\u2019t exercise the post\u2011call path (which could be because the implementation indeed never returns at runtime). If, however, OS_TaskEntryPoint were actually declared with a noreturn attribute (or the analyser is otherwise able to prove the call never returns), then code after that call would be statically unreachable and would violate Rule 2.1 unless justified by an approved deviation. But given the presented code and evidence, Agent A\u2019s blanket claim of a MISRA 2.1 violation is incorrect."
