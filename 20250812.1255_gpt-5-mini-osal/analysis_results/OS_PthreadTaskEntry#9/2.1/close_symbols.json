  "explanation": "To decide whether the 'return NULL;' in OS_PthreadTaskEntry is unreachable you must prove whether the call OS_TaskEntryPoint(...) ever returns. Therefore you need: (1) OS_TaskEntryPoint's prototype and implementation to see if it contains a non-returning control flow (explicit return, infinite loop, call to a non-returning function, or is annotated as noreturn). (2) OS_TaskExit's prototype/implementation because OS_TaskEntryPoint calls it \u2014 OS_TaskExit might itself be non-returning (for example by calling pthread_exit, exit, abort, or being annotated noreturn), which would make OS_TaskEntryPoint non-returning. (3) OS_TaskPrepare's implementation because it is in the call chain of OS_TaskEntryPoint; any control-flow there that affects eventual return (exceptions, longjmps, or non-returning calls) must be examined. (4) The definition of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t to confirm that local_arg.id is the intended member and that there is no undefined/conditional behavior that could alter control-flow analysis. (5) Any macros/attributes used to mark functions as non-returning (OS_NORETURN or similar), since those affect static determination of reachability. (6) If OS_TaskExit or other functions call pthread_exit (or similar OS APIs), include pthread_exit's declaration/semantics because it is a well-known non-returning API on POSIX threads and is relevant to establishing non-returning behavior. Examining these symbols allows a correct determination of whether the code after the call is unreachable (and thus violates the MISRA rule)."
