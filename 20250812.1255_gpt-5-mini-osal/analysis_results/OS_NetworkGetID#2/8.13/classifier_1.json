  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call passes the address of a local int32 (IdBuf) to a lower-level function that is expected to write an output value. Because the pointer is used for output (the callee must modify the pointee), it must be a pointer to a non-const int32. Therefore the pointer is not required to be const-qualified and Rule 8.13 is not violated in this fragment."
