  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NetworkGetID:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID(void)\n{\n    int32 IdBuf;\n\n    /* always delegate to low-level API */\n    if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* return a hardcoded value on failure */\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    return IdBuf;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetID:\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "OS_NetworkGetID_Impl performs a required action (calls gethostid and stores the result) and returns OS_SUCCESS unconditionally. Although callers (e.g. OS_NetworkGetID) check the return value and their failure branch will never be taken given the current implementation, that caller branch is unreachable rather than executed redundant code. The operations in OS_NetworkGetID_Impl are executed and affect program behaviour (the IdBuf assignment is used), so there is no executed operation whose removal would leave behaviour unchanged. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
