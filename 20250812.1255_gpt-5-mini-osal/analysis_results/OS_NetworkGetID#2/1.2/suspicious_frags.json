  "explanation": "I examined all provided fragments (the OS_NetworkGetID function, the OS_NetworkGetID_Impl function, the typedef for int32, and the OS_SUCCESS macro). None of these use compiler-specific language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_..., typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), zero-length arrays, anonymous/unnamed language-extension-specific struct/union features, Microsoft-specific __declspec, or other vendor-specific keywords). Specific reasons:\n\n- typedef int32_t int32: uses the standard fixed-width integer typedef from <stdint.h> \u2014 this is standard C, not a compiler extension.\n- #define OS_SUCCESS (0): plain preprocessor macro, standard C.\n- int32 return type and local variable IdBuf: standard C types and declarations.\n- Calls to OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) and the return -1 / return IdBuf statements: standard C control flow and integer literals.\n- The implementation *IdBuf = gethostid();: calling a library/OS function (gethostid) is a platform or POSIX/library API usage, not a compiler language extension. Assignment and pointer usage are standard C. (Note: whether gethostid is declared via the correct header is not shown in the snippets; an implicit function declaration would be a nonconforming/legacy feature in older C dialects and some compilers may allow it as an extension \u2014 however there is no evidence in the supplied code that the prototype is missing, so that cannot be concluded from the fragments provided.)\n\nGiven the supplied code, there are no explicit uses of language/compiler extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. If you want, I can re-evaluate if you provide the compilation unit including all includes and compiler settings (to check for implicit declarations or use of headers that rely on compiler-specific constructs)."
