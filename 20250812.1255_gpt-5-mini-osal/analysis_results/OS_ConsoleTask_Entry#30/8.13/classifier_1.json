  "scenario": "The assignment local_arg.opaque_arg = arg simply copies an opaque void * value into a union member and the pointer is not dereferenced or used to modify pointee data. Therefore the code fragment itself does not require a const-qualified pointer and does not violate Rule 8.13. A concrete violation scenario would be if the function does not (and should not) modify the data pointed to by arg yet the parameter is declared as void * (and the pointer is subsequently used to access/read the pointed-to data) \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared const void *arg (or the union member should be const void *) and leaving it non-const would violate Rule 8.13."
