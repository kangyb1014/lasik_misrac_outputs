  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings:\n\n- inet_pton (declaration and implementation used on target platform): The function calls inet_pton. To decide if the target function itself (or via its call to inet_pton) violates the rule you must inspect the actual inet_pton implementation on the target platform to see whether it uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. If inet_pton internally uses memcmp on presentation strings, that could be a violation attributed to that implementation; at minimum you must know whether this external call could trigger the rule.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t (type definition): The code manipulates Addr->AddrData and casts it to the accessor. Knowing the type layout shows whether any string data lives inside Addr (which might be compared using memcmp) and confirms the cast is to a non-string/binary area rather than to char buffers.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (type definition): The function uses this accessor to select addrbuffer. Its definition reveals whether the fields referenced (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) are character arrays or binary IP address structures; this determines whether any memcmp in this function (or nearby code) would be comparing NUL-terminated strings or binary blobs.\n\n- struct in_addr (definition): The code uses &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr. Knowing that struct in_addr holds binary address bytes (not NUL-terminated strings) demonstrates that any comparisons of these fields using memcmp would be on binary data, not C strings (so not a MISRA memcmp-on-strings violation).\n\n- struct in6_addr (definition): Same reason as struct in_addr for the IPv6 sin6_addr field \u2014 confirms the target buffer is binary, not a NUL-terminated string.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6 (macros/constants): These control flow values determine which addrbuffer is selected. Confirming their values helps ensure the code path selects binary address fields rather than a character/string field.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (compile-time macro): Whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in affects the analysis paths; you need to know if IPv6 code is present and therefore whether sin6_addr (binary) is used.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS (return-code macros): These do not affect the memcmp rule directly, but are needed to fully understand return semantics and whether any early-return paths might lead to other code (not shown) that does string comparisons. Include them to allow a complete control-flow understanding when searching for hidden memcmp uses.\n\n- parameter 'const char *string' (semantics: is it a NUL-terminated C string): The MISRA rule specifically concerns memcmp used to compare NUL-terminated strings. You must confirm whether the 'string' parameter is intended and guaranteed to be a NUL-terminated presentation-format address (as expected by inet_pton). If it were instead treated as a fixed-length binary buffer, then memcmp use might be acceptable. Confirming the semantics of this parameter is necessary to determine if any memcmp usage would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\nNotes: The target function itself contains no explicit memcmp calls. The primary items to inspect for a MISRA memcmp-on-strings violation are (a) whether this function uses memcmp (it does not), (b) whether the buffers it operates on are character (NUL-terminated) strings or binary data (struct in_addr/in6_addr are binary), and (c) whether the called library function inet_pton (on the target platform) uses memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to make those determinations."
