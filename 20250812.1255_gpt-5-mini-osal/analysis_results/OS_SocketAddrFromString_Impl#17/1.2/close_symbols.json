  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check for language\u2011extension usage:\n- OS_SockAddr_t: Needed to inspect the definition of the public socket address type to detect if it uses compiler extensions (e.g. attributes, anonymous/unnamed members, non\u2011standard storage specifiers, packed/aligned attributes, bit\u2011fields or other extensions).\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The code casts into this accessor type; its definition must be examined for anonymous unions/structs, GCC/Clang __attribute__s, __extension__ usage, flexible array members, or other non\u2011standard constructs that would make the function rely on language extensions.\n- struct sockaddr: The nested sa member and sa_family type come from this structure; its precise definition (sa_family_t type, any extensions) matters for determining extension usage.\n- struct sockaddr_in: The sa_in member used for AF_INET must be inspected to ensure no compiler extensions are used in its fields (e.g. non\u2011standard macros, attributes).\n- struct sockaddr_in6: Same as sockaddr_in but for AF_INET6; required if OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined, to detect any extensions in IPv6 address fields.\n- struct in_addr / struct in6_addr: The actual address members (&sin_addr, &sin6_addr) must be checked for extensions (anonymous members, attributes, non\u2011standard types).\n- sa_family_t (or the declaration used for Addr->AddrData.sa.sa_family): Needed to check whether the family field uses any non\u2011standard type or extension.\n- AF_INET / AF_INET6: Macro definitions must be inspected to ensure they are simple integer macros/constants and not implemented via compiler extensions or complex expressions/macros that require extensions.\n- inet_pton (prototype from <arpa/inet.h>): The function declaration may include compiler\u2011specific attributes or macros (e.g. __attribute__(), GNU extensions); its declaration must be examined to determine whether calling it in this way depends on language extensions.\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: This conditional macro controls inclusion of AF_INET6 handling. Its definition or how it is provided (e.g. via compiler flags or non\u2011standard pragmas) must be known to determine if conditional compilation relies on extensions.\n- int32 (typedef): The return type used by the function must be checked to ensure it is a standard typedef (e.g. int32_t) and not a compiler\u2011specific extended type.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS / OS_ERROR / OS_SUCCESS: These status macros/constants should be inspected to ensure they are ordinary integer macros or enum constants and not defined using compiler extensions or unusual constructs.\n\nIn short, the list covers all user and system types, macros and the external function used inside OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl whose definitions could hide language extensions (anonymous/unnamed unions/structs, __attribute__ usages, __extension__ or other compiler\u2011specific constructs). Inspecting these symbols is necessary to decide whether the target function itself relies on non\u2011standard language extensions."
