  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a MISRA 'no unreachable code' analysis of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The full definition (including AddrData) is needed to confirm the cast to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t is valid and to see whether any members/aliases could change control flow semantics.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: Required to inspect the exact fields used (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) and the type of sa.sa_family so the switch expression and subsequent references are understood.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa.sa_family) / sa_family_t: Needed to know the type and range of sa_family values and whether any platform-specific definitions could make certain case labels impossible or redundant (affects reachability of cases/default).\n\n- struct in_addr (sin_addr): To confirm that &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr is a valid destination for inet_pton and that taking its address does not imply other control flow (not expected but required to reason about reachable code after the switch).\n\n- struct in6_addr (sin6_addr): Same as in_addr but for the AF_INET6 branch; also needed because presence/absence of this field (or conditional compilation) affects which switch cases exist.\n\n- AF_INET: The numeric value/definition is required to ensure the switch case label is valid and distinct from other labels (important to reason about which case can be selected and whether any case is unreachable).\n\n- AF_INET6: Same reasoning as AF_INET; additionally, if AF_INET6 equals AF_INET or is otherwise ill-defined on the target, this could affect reachability. Its presence is also gated by OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: This preprocessor macro controls whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in. Its value changes the compiled control-flow graph (and thus whether certain code is present/reachable).\n\n- inet_pton: The prototype and documented return semantics (returns 1 on success, 0 for invalid string, -1 on error) are required to determine whether the code after the inet_pton call (return OS_SUCCESS) is reachable and whether alternative returns (OS_ERROR) can occur.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS: Definition/value is needed to confirm the default branch is performing a return (and to consider whether that return could be optimized away or altered) and to identify the return statement preceding the unreachable 'break'.\n\n- OS_ERROR: Required to understand the possible return from the inet_pton failure path and to reason about reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Required to confirm the final return value and to reason about whether that return is reachable given inet_pton semantics.\n\nNotes: The primary explicit unreachable-code candidate in this function is the 'break;' immediately following 'return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;' in the default label. To conclude a MISRA violation you must confirm the default branch is compiled as shown (OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6, AF_* definitions), and that the return is indeed unconditional (which also requires knowing the definitions above). The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to decide if the 'break' (or any other statement) is provably unreachable in the compiled configuration."
