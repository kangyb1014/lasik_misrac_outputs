  "explanation": "The only unreachable code in the function is the break; immediately following the return in the switch default branch \u2014 that break can never be executed. Other parts of the function are reachable: the AF_INET and (conditionally compiled) AF_INET6 case bodies assign addrbuffer and break normally; the default return is reachable when the family is not handled; the inet_pton call and its error check, and the final return OS_SUCCESS are all reachable when control flows past the switch. No other statements in the shown function are syntactically dead code (there are no statements following unconditional returns or infinite loops aside from the single unreachable break shown), and conditional compilation reasonably governs the presence of the AF_INET6 case rather than creating unreachable code."
