  "explanation": "No uses of the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided function. The only external function called is inet_pton, which is not a <string.h> function and thus outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The addrbuffer pointer is set to members of the sockaddr structures (sin_addr / sin6_addr) inside the accessor union; those assignments themselves do not invoke any of the listed string.h functions. Therefore there are no code fragments invoking string.h string-handling functions that need investigation under Rule 21.17. Note: If reviewers are concerned about potential overflows from inet_pton or about the adequacy of OS_SOCKADDR_MAX_LEN relative to the sockaddr types, that is a valid separate safety check but is not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 (which specifically covers the listed <string.h> functions)."
