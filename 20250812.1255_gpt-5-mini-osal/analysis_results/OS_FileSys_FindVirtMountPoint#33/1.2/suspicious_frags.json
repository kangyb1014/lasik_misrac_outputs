  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions (such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), or other vendor-specific keywords) appear directly in the shown code fragment. Common C constructs used here (bool, size_t, pointer casts, sizeof, strncmp, array indexing, and boolean literals) are part of standard C (C99 and later) and are not compiler extensions by themselves. The three fragments reported above should be investigated because they reference macros or functions and a type whose definitions are outside this snippet and may hide compiler-specific extensions: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a macro invocation (macros can expand to compiler-specific constructs), OS_strnlen is a platform-specific wrapper that might be implemented using extensions, and the OS_filesys_internal_record_t type (and its member virtual_mountpt) may carry attributes or nonstandard definitions. All other lines in the function use standard language features and do not warrant further investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the provided code alone."
