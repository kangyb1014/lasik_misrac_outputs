  "explanation": "- get_cpu_core_count: called directly by detect_process_cpu_core_count; its implementation (or callees) may use string.h functions or global buffers that could cause a bounds violation relevant to the MISRA rule. You must inspect it to confirm no string.h usage that can access objects referred to by pointers.  \n- detect_cpu_core_count: a callee of get_cpu_core_count (per the static graph). Include it because string operations may be buried one level deeper and still be relevant to the safety of detect_process_cpu_core_count.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count: called directly by detect_process_cpu_core_count; its implementation may call multiple platform-specific helper functions that may use string.h functions or operate on buffers. Inspecting it is required to ensure no out-of-bounds string.h use that could be attributed (directly or indirectly) to the behavior of detect_process_cpu_core_count.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_: one platform-specific helper called by mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count. Include it because it may contain string handling (or buffer manipulation) relevant to the MISRA rule.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_: another platform-specific helper; include for the same reason.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_: another platform-specific helper; include for the same reason.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_: Windows-specific helper; include to cover platform-specific code paths that might use string.h functions.  \n- printf: used in detect_process_cpu_core_count. Although printf is not a string.h function, its format strings and how they are invoked should be checked to ensure no unsafe handling of string pointers/objects is occurring in this function.  \n- fprintf: used in detect_process_cpu_core_count. Same rationale as printf: include to verify use of string arguments and to rule out any indirect string.h usage tied to these calls.\n\nNote: detect_process_cpu_core_count itself does not pass pointers to these functions, so it is unlikely to directly cause a string.h out-of-bounds via pointer parameters. The listed symbols are the minimal set of callees (and their immediate helpers) whose source must be inspected to be certain no string.h functions are used in ways that could violate the MISRA rule when the target function is executed."
