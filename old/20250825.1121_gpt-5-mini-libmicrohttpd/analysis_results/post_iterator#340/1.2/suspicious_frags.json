  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__) are present.\n- No inline assembly, nested functions (a GCC extension), statement-expressions ({ ... }) or other known vendor extensions are used.\n- All types are standard C types or standard-library typedefs (uint64_t, size_t) from C99/C11; these are not compiler extensions.\n- All casts and conversions (for example the implicit conversion from void * to struct Request *) are valid standard C.\n- Identifiers beginning with MHD_ are library API names (libmicrohttpd) and are not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 for use of compiler language extensions."
