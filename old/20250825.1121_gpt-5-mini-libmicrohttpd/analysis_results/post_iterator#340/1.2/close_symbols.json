  "explanation": "To decide whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions it relies on, because extensions can be introduced in those symbols rather than in the function body itself. Specifically:\n\n- enum MHD_Result (definition): determines whether MHD_Result is a plain C enum/typedef or defined using compiler-specific extensions (e.g. attributes, non\u2011standard storage-class macros).\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): same reason as above \u2014 the enum/type might be declared using compiler extensions.\n- MHD_YES (enumerator or macro): this constant\u2019s definition could be a macro or alias that uses extensions; you need its exact definition to check for extension usage.\n- struct Request (definition): the function casts cls to struct Request* and reads request->session; the Request type could embed non\u2011standard features (anonymous structs/unions, flexible array members with nonstandard syntax, attributes), so its declaration must be checked.\n- struct Session (definition) \u2014 including types of session->sid, session->value_1, session->value_2: the code indexes and copies into these members. You must know whether those members are normal char arrays/pointers or involve compiler extensions (flexible-array members, variable-length arrays, bitfields, attributes, packed/aligned extensions, or nonstandard types).\n- uint64_t (typedef from <stdint.h>): confirm it is the standard typedef and not replaced by a compiler-specific extension/type.\n- size_t (typedef from <stddef.h>/<stdio.h>): likewise confirm it is the standard type and not an extension.\n- memcpy (prototype from <string.h>): its declaration could be a macro or annotated with compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__); check to see if such extensions are present.\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): same rationale \u2014 its declaration/definition might use compiler extensions.\n- fprintf (prototype from <stdio.h>): standard function declarations may be annotated with compiler attributes (format, nonnull, etc.) or replaced by macros in some headers; include to verify no language extensions are used.\n- stdout and stderr (definitions/macros from <stdio.h>): these can be macros or objects possibly defined using extensions on some platforms; their declarations should be reviewed.\n- Microhttpd/public header(s) that declare MHD_* symbols (e.g. <microhttpd.h>) including any macros/attributes used there: many library headers use compiler-specific macros/attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec) to decorate types, enums, constants, or functions. To assert conformance with the MISRA rule you must inspect those header definitions to ensure none of the used symbols are implemented via compiler language extensions.\n\nProviding these symbols (the exact declarations/definitions or the header contents) is sufficient to determine if any language/compiler extensions are being used by the target function either directly or via the types/macros it depends on."
