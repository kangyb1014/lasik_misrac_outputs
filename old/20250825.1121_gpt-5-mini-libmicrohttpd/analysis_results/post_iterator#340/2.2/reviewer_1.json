  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The three (void)parameter; statements are the conventional way to document/silence unused-parameter compiler warnings; they have no effect on program behaviour but are an accepted idiom to indicate an intentionally unused parameter. MISRA's intent with Rule 2.2 is to prohibit truly dead/leftover code that represents unused logic or functionality, not the deliberate discard of a parameter name to suppress warnings. In other words, thesediscarded-value expressions are neither unreachable nor leftover algorithmic code and are acceptable for handling unused parameters (or alternatively the parameter name can be omitted). Therefore the report that (void) content_type; violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
