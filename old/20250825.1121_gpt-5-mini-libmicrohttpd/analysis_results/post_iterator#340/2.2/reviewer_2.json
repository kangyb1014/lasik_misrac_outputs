It is executed but has no effect on program behaviour; removing it would not change the program. Therefore it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (same applies to the other '(void) ...' lines for unused parameters).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function post_iterator:\nconst char *value\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is not correct. The (void) parameter statements are the common idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics; they serve a well-defined purpose (documenting intent and avoiding warnings) and are therefore not \u201cdead code\u201d in the sense intended by Rule 2.2. Rule 2.2 targets operations that are executed but have no purpose and whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Those cast-to-void statements do not constitute useless application logic and are a deliberate source-level annotation; compilers typically omit them entirely from generated code, and MISRA practice accepts this idiom to handle unused parameters. Consequently the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
