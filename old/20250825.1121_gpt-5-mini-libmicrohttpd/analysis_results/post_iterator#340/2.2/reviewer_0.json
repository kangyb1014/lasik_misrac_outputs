  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements like '(void) kind;' are evaluated expression statements that have no side effects; removing them would not alter the program behaviour, so they meet the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The same applies to the other '(void) ...;' lines used only to silence compiler warnings. (Only if the parameter were volatile or reading it had some implementation-defined observable effect would the statements not be dead; that is not the case in the shown code.)"
