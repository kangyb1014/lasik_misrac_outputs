  "explanation": "- strcmp: post_iterator calls strcmp several times. To prove absence of recursion you must know whether strcmp is an external library function (no user callbacks) or if a user-provided strcmp implementation could call back into post_iterator (indirect recursion).\n- memcpy: post_iterator calls memcpy. Verify memcpy is the standard library function (does not call user code) or check any project-specific implementation that could call post_iterator.\n- fprintf: used for stdout/stderr logging. fprintf is a potential indirect recursion source only if replaced/overridden in the project or if the FILE stream hooks invoke user code. Provide its definition/implementation or confirmation it is the standard libc function.\n- struct Request: post_iterator casts cls to struct Request and accesses request->session. You must inspect this struct to see whether it contains function pointers or references that could lead to calling post_iterator (indirect recursion).\n- struct Session: post_iterator writes into session->value_1/2 and reads session->sid. The Session definition must be checked for embedded function pointers, callbacks, or destructor/notification hooks that could cause indirect calls back into post_iterator.\n- enum MHD_Result: return type (and associated constants) \u2014 include to ensure that any macros (e.g. MHD_YES) are ordinary constants and do not expand to function-like constructs that could invoke code.\n- MHD_YES (macro/const): post_iterator returns MHD_YES in many places. Confirm this is a simple enum value or macro with no side effects/calls.\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: present as a parameter (currently unused). Include its definition only to confirm that passing/using it does not invoke callbacks via unusual macro/inline behavior.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions (or confirmations that they are the standard library implementations / simple constants) so the next analysis can determine whether any called symbol or accessed structure can directly or indirectly call post_iterator, which is required to decide MISRA's no-recursion rule compliance."
