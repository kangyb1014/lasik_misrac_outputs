  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule \u201ca function parameter shall not be modified\u201d: \n\n- struct Request: post_iterator casts the void *cls to struct Request *request; the Request definition is needed to confirm that only members of the object pointed to by cls are modified (allowed) and that the parameter variable cls itself is not reassigned.\n\n- struct Session: Request contains a Session pointer; the Session definition is needed to inspect which objects (value_1, value_2, sid) are being written and to decide whether those writes modify objects vs pointer parameters.\n\n- session->value_1 (declaration/type): The code uses sizeof(session->value_1) and writes into session->value_1 via memcpy and indexing. Knowing whether value_1 is an array or a pointer matters to determine if sizeof yields the array size and to confirm these operations modify the pointed-to object (allowed) rather than changing a pointer parameter (disallowed).\n\n- session->value_2 (declaration/type): Same reason as value_1; used in bounds/copy logic.\n\n- session->sid (declaration/type): Used in fprintf; include to confirm it is a member data object (allowed to be read) and that no pointer parameter is reassigned.\n\n- enum MHD_Result / MHD_YES: Return values used by the function; include to be able to reason about return expressions (not relevant to parameter mutation but required for a complete semantic view).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The function has a parameter of this enum type (kind) which is cast to void (unused). Its declaration is needed to ensure there is no hidden macro/side effect or aliasing that could modify the parameter.\n\n- memcpy prototype: memcpy is called with expressions that include parameters (data) and addresses derived from session fields. The prototype confirms that memcpy receives its arguments by value (dest, src, size) so it cannot modify the caller's pointer parameter variables themselves; it only modifies the pointed-to destination object.\n\n- strcmp prototype: Used to compare key against literal strings. Prototype confirms no side effects on the input pointer parameters.\n\n- fprintf prototype: Used for logging; prototype confirms it does not alter function parameters.\n\n- stdout / stderr: FILE objects passed to fprintf; included to fully model fprintf calls and confirm no parameter mutation occurs via those calls.\n\n- size_t typedef: The parameter size is of type size_t and is reassigned inside the function. The typedef is included for completeness and to ensure type-compatible assignment rules are applied when determining whether the parameter variable itself is modified (which would violate MISRA).\n\n- uint64_t typedef: The parameter off is uint64_t and used in arithmetic/limits; include to reason about promotions/expressions when detecting modifications to parameters.\n\nIn practice the critical symbols to decide the MISRA violation are: the parameter declarations (size, off, data, cls, key, etc.), struct Request and struct Session (and the types of their members), and the prototypes of called library functions (memcpy, strcmp, fprintf) so we can be certain the code modifies object contents only and identify the explicit assignment to the parameter 'size' (which is a direct parameter modification and thus a MISRA violation)."
