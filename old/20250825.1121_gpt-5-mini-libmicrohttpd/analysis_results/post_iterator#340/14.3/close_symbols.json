Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA C rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d you need the following and why:\n\n- struct Session (complete definition, including types and sizes of session->value_1, session->value_2 and session->sid): The code uses sizeof(session->value_1) and sizeof(session->value_2) and writes into those arrays. Whether those sizeof expressions are compile-time constants, and whether the comparisons involving off/size (off >= sizeof(...)-1, size+off >= sizeof(...)) can ever be invariant depends on whether value_1/value_2 are fixed-size arrays (compile-time constant) or pointers/ flexible arrays. The actual array sizes are required to decide if the controlling comparisons are potentially constant-true/false.\n\n- struct Request (complete definition, showing the session member): The function casts cls to struct Request* and reads request->session. Knowing the exact member type confirms that session is the expected struct Session instance and ensures the sizeof() expressions refer to that concrete type.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (definition) and the enumerator MHD_YES: The function returns MHD_YES in all branches. For MISRA analysis it is useful to know if MHD_YES is a plain enumerator/constant (no side-effects) and to check whether any controlling expression depends on or compares against enumerated values elsewhere. At minimum, include to fully resolve types/return semantics.\n\n- strcmp (prototype and semantics: int strcmp(const char *, const char *)): The key-based branches use 0 == strcmp(\"DONE\", key), etc. To argue these controlling expressions are not invariant you must know strcmp semantics (runtime string comparison) and that its result depends on the runtime value of key. Including the prototype/semantics rules out a surprise macro or alternative implementation that could be constant.\n\n- uint64_t and size_t typedefs (definitions for the types of off and size): The comparisons use off (uint64_t) and size (size_t) in arithmetic and relational expressions. Knowing their widths/ranges is necessary to reason about wrap/overflow and whether expressions like size + off >= sizeof(...) can be statically invariant (e.g., due to type width or implicit conversions).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): Even though the parameter kind is unused here, including its definition documents whether it could be a define/constant that might affect analysis or be used in other compilation units; it is part of the function signature and useful to fully resolve unused-parameter comments.\n\nNote: Standard library functions used for side effects (memcpy, fprintf) are not needed to decide if the controlling expressions are invariant. The critical missing information for determining invariance is the concrete layout/types/sizes of session->value_1 and session->value_2, the types and ranges of off/size, and confirmation that strcmp behaves as a runtime string comparison (not a constant/macro)."
