True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code assigns the callback context 'cls' (void *) to a non-const pointer: 'struct Request *request = cls;'. The function only reads from the Request object (it obtains request->session) and does not modify the Request itself, so the pointer can and should be const-qualified. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, this should be written as 'const struct Request *request = cls;'. Because 'request' is non-const although it could be const, the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown function the local pointer 'request' is only used for reading (request->session) and the Request object is never modified through it, so it can and should be declared pointing to a const-qualified type. Declaring 'const struct Request *request = cls;' satisfies MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Note that making 'request' const does not prevent modifying the Session object pointed to by request->session (the member type is still 'struct Session *'), so the function's behavior is unchanged. (Also acceptable is an explicit cast if needed when converting from the void* callback context, but the simple change above is sufficient.)"
