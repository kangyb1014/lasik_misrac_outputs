  "explanation": "The fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because their pointer types are already const-qualified where appropriate (e.g. const char *key, filename, content_type, transfer_encoding, const char *data), or they clearly must be mutable because the code writes through them (the session->value_1 / value_2 buffers are modified with memcpy and nul-termination, so those pointers must be non-const). The (void) casts are only to suppress unused-parameter warnings and are unrelated to const qualification. strcmp/fprintf/sizeof/memcpy usages are consistent with the existing const qualifications and do not indicate missing const on their pointer operands."
