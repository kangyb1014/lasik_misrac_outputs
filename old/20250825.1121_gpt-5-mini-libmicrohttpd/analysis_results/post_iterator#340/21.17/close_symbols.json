This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether the string/memory operations in post_iterator can access beyond object bounds you must know the exact memory layout and types involved and how integer arithmetic and promotions behave on the target platform.\n\n- struct Session: The function indexes and writes into session->value_1 and session->value_2 and reads session->sid. The full struct definition is required to know whether value_1/value_2 are arrays (and their compile-time sizes) or pointers (in which case sizeof(...) yields pointer size). That directly affects whether the bounds checks (using sizeof(session->value_X)) are correct.\n\n- struct Request: Needed to confirm that request->session is a pointer to the Session instance used by the function and to ensure no aliasing/indirection issues (that affects whether session is valid and how sizeof expressions are interpreted in context).\n\n- session->value_1 (declaration: type and array size): The code uses sizeof(session->value_1) and writes into session->value_1 via memcpy and by setting a terminating '\\0'. You must know the element type and exact array length to verify the comparisons and the cropping logic (off >= sizeof - 1, size + off >= sizeof, memcpy length) actually prevent out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes.\n\n- session->value_2 (declaration: type and array size): Same reason as value_1 for the v2 branch.\n\n- session->sid (declaration: type and array size): Although sid is only used in fprintf (read-only), knowing its type/size confirms no potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds read by other code paths or misuse assumptions about null\u2011termination.\n\n- memcpy (prototype from <string.h>): To apply the MISRA rule you should assume the standard semantics: memcpy copies the exact number of bytes requested and does not do bounds checking. Having the prototype clarifies the parameter types (void *dest, const void *src, size_t n) and helps reason about type conversions of the length argument.\n\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): strcmp is used to check keys. Its semantics (reads until a '\\0') are relevant to ensure that uses of key are safe and that the function does not rely on key being within a particular buffer in a way that could read out of bounds.\n\n- target platform integer type sizes (sizeof(size_t) and sizeof(uint64_t)): The function mixes uint64_t (off) and size_t (size and sizeof results) in comparisons and arithmetic (size + off). The widths and signedness of these types on the target platform determine integer promotion, potential truncation, and whether expressions like size + off and comparisons against sizeof(...) behave as intended (no wrap/truncation leading to missed bounds checks).\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and platform type sizes) is sufficient to verify whether memcpy and the manual truncation logic can ever cause writes beyond the destination arrays and thus to decide compliance with the MISRA string-handling/bounds rule."
