If size + off overflows the unsigned integer type, the check `if (size + off >= sizeof(session->value_1))` can be bypassed and memcpy will copy more bytes than the buffer can hold. Example on a 64-bit system: sizeof(session->value_1)==64, off = 1, size = SIZE_MAX (e.g. 18446744073709551615ULL). Then size + off wraps to 0, the condition is false, memcpy(&session->value_1[off], data, size) copies SIZE_MAX bytes into a 64-byte buffer, causing out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore Rule 21.17 is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function post_iterator:\nstruct Session\n{\n  /**\n   * We keep all sessions in a linked list.\n   */\n  struct Session *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Unique ID for this session.\n   */\n  char sid[33];\n\n  /**\n   * Reference counter giving the number of connections\n   * currently using this session.\n   */\n  unsigned int rc;\n\n  /**\n   * Time when this session was last active.\n   */\n  time_t start;\n\n  /**\n   * String submitted via form.\n   */\n  char value_1[64];\n\n  /**\n   * Another value submitted via form.\n   */\n  char value_2[64];\n\n}\n...\nstruct Request\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Associated session.\n   */\n  struct Session *session;\n\n  /**\n   * Post processor handling form data (IF this is\n   * a POST request).\n   */\n  struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp;\n\n  /**\n   * URL to serve in response to this POST (if this request\n   * was a 'POST')\n   */\n  const char *post_url;\n\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Reasoning: off is an unsigned 64-bit integer (uint64_t) and size is size_t (on a 64-bit platform typically also 64-bit). The expression size + off is an unsigned addition that can wrap modulo 2^64. If size is very large (e.g. SIZE_MAX) the sum can overflow and become small, bypassing the check if (size + off >= sizeof(session->value_1)). That allows memcpy(&session->value_1[off], data, size) to be called with a huge size, causing out-of-bounds writes and thereby violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The example given by agent A (off = 1, size = SIZE_MAX, sizeof(...) == 64) demonstrates the problem. Fix: perform the bounds computation in a way that avoids wraparound, e.g. check off first, then compute a remaining size in a type that can represent the subtraction safely, or test for wrap with if (size > SIZE_MAX - off) before adding. A safe approach: if (off >= sizeof(session->value_1) - 1) return; remaining = (size_t)(sizeof(session->value_1) - off - 1); if (size > remaining) size = remaining; memcpy(..., size); This prevents the overflow and eliminates the out-of-bounds risk."
