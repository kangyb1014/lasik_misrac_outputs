  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- struct Request (definition): post_iterator casts cls to struct Request* and reads request->session. Knowing the structure is required to reason whether request->session can be NULL or otherwise statically constrained (which could make parts of the function unreachable).\n\n- struct Session (definition): the body dereferences session and accesses its members. The complete struct definition is needed to determine member types and compile-time sizes used in comparisons (sizeof(session->value_x)) that affect reachability of branches.\n\n- session->value_1 (member declaration and array size): the code uses sizeof(session->value_1) in branch conditions and copies into this buffer. The exact array length (or type) is required to decide if the off/size tests can ever be true/false at compile time (i.e. whether those branches are reachable).\n\n- session->value_2 (member declaration and array size): same reason as value_1 \u2014 needed to determine reachability of the v2 branch and the discard/crop branches.\n\n- session->sid (member declaration): used in the \"DONE\" branch output. Knowing its type/size can be relevant if its presence/format is constrained by initialisation code making the DONE branch impossible.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and enumerator MHD_YES: the function returns MHD_YES; the definition is needed to confirm return values and whether any return path is impossible/ill-typed (helps reasoning about control flow completeness, though not usually blocking reachability by itself).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: the parameter kind is explicitly ignored, but its definition (and any contractual semantics from the library) can be relevant if certain kinds are never passed to this callback by the caller, making some branches (based on key values) unreachable in practice.\n\n- Post-processor registration / call sites that install/invoke post_iterator: the set of keys that can reach this callback and the way the callback is invoked come from the registration and caller code (e.g. which form fields are produced or filtered). To determine whether the \"DONE\", \"v1\", or \"v2\" comparisons can actually occur, you must inspect the code that registers/calls the callback and any logic that constrains field names.\n\n- Functions/locations that initialise/allocate Request and Session instances: initialisation code may populate or constrain session contents (including member sizes, sentinel values, or guaranteed states). Those guarantees can render branches unreachable (for example, if some initializer always sets a flag or never allows certain keys), so those initialisers are required to prove reachability.\n\n- Any compile-time macros that determine the sizes of value_1/value_2: if array sizes depend on macros or conditional compilation, those macros must be known to evaluate sizeof and to decide whether the boundary checks (off/size comparisons) can ever be true or false at compile time.\n\nNote: standard library functions used (strcmp, memcpy, fprintf) do not need special symbol definitions for reachability reasoning beyond their semantic behavior; the list above focuses on symbols that can make branches provably unreachable (compile-time/type/initialisation constraints and caller-registration context)."
