  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- The for loop in MHD_get_response_header: for (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  - The controlling expression (NULL != pos) depends on pos, which is initialized from response->first_header and updated each iteration via pos = pos->next; it is not invariant.\n\n- The if check at the start of MHD_get_response_header: if (NULL == key)\n  - This depends on the function parameter key and is not an invariant constant expression.\n\n- The for loop in MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  - The controlling expression (i < len) depends on i and len (len is a parameter); i is incremented each iteration so the expression is not invariant at compile-time or across iterations in general.\n\n- There are no do-while loops with a constant false expression, nor any while/for loops with constant true/false controlling expressions (e.g., while(1) or for(;;)) that would need the allowed exception for intentional infinite loops.\n\n- The expression return ! 0; is a constant expression but it is not a loop or branch controlling expression and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided code that appear to violate Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). If you want, I can re-check if additional surrounding code (not provided) contains invariant loop controls."
