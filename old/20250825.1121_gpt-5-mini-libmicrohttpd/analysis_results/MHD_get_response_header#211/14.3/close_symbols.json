  "explanation": "struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The for-loop controlling expression (NULL != pos) and the inner if ((pos->header_size == key_size) && ...) depend on fields of the list node (pos). To determine whether these expressions can be invariant you must know the exact layout and qualifiers of the node (names, types and any const/volatile qualifiers for header_size, header, value and next). For example, if next were an immutable/NULL or header_size a compile-time constant, the loop/test could be invariant.\\n\\nstruct MHD_Response: The initial value used by the loop (response->first_header) comes from this struct. You must know the type and qualifiers of first_header (and whether it is a fixed/constant/immutable pointer) to decide if the loop's controlling expression is potentially invariant.\\n\\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: The inner if's second conjunct is a function call. To decide whether the combined condition is invariant you need the function's prototype/semantics and whether it has side-effects or always returns a constant for given inputs (or is a macro/inline that could expand to a constant). Its return type (boolean/int) and purity determine whether the controlling expression can vary across iterations."
