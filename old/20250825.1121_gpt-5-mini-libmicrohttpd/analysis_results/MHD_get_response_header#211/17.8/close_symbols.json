  "explanation": "struct MHD_Response: needed to inspect the declaration of the response parameter (in particular the first_header member). Confirm whether first_header is a plain data member (so reading it does not modify the parameter variable) or a macro/inline accessor that could assign to or otherwise modify the response parameter.\n\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to see the types and names of members used in the function (header_size, header, value, next). This lets you determine whether those member access expressions are simple data accesses (no side effects) or macros/functions that might modify the pointer parameters.\n\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: the prototype/definition is required to determine whether this call can modify any of the pointer arguments (in particular the key parameter). If the function takes non-const pointers or pointer-to-pointer parameters, it could modify the passed pointer or the pointed-to object; the prototype/implementation shows const qualifiers and side effects.\n\nstrlen: include the declaration/signature to confirm its argument and that it does not modify the key pointer (i.e., it takes const char * and has no side effects that would count as modifying the parameter variable).\n\nsize_t typedef: knowing the exact typedef/definition for size_t clarifies the types used for header_size and key_size (confirms they are value types and not some macro/type that could hide side effects)."
