  "explanation": "No code fragment in MHD_get_response_header modifies a function parameter (the pointer variables themselves). Specifically:\n- The parameters are: struct MHD_Response *response and const char *key. Neither response nor key are assigned to or otherwise modified in the function body (no statements like response = ..., key = ..., ++response, etc.).\n- Members of *response are read (response->first_header) but the response pointer itself is not altered; reading object members is allowed.\n- The function only reads through pointers (strlen(key), passing key to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_), and the helper function and its signature use const pointers and do not modify the pointed-to data.\n- Local variables (pos, key_size, i in helper) are used and updated, which is permitted.\n- Although MHD_HTTP_Res_Header.header and .value are declared as char * (non-const), the code only reads them (no writes), so the objects are not modified via the parameters.\nGiven these observations, there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
