  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_response_header violates the MISRA rule against self-call (direct or indirect recursion) you must inspect every call it makes and every path those calls can take back to MHD_get_response_header.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This is the non-library function called inside the loop. You need its definition and its full call chain to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls MHD_get_response_header.\n\n- strlen: Although a standard-lib function, include its declaration/implementation origin in the analysis to confirm it does not call back into application code (usually it does not). This rules out a surprising indirect recursion via overridden/replaced implementations.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The loop walks pos->next and reads pos->header, pos->header_size and pos->value. The struct definition is required to confirm that accessing these fields does not invoke macros, inline functions, or contain embedded function pointers that could be invoked here or elsewhere to produce an indirect call back to MHD_get_response_header.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: Its definition is needed to see the type of first_header and whether accessing it could involve indirections or function-pointer semantics that might lead to calls.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: To prove absence of indirect recursion you must examine the entire transitive call set starting at MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_. List and inspect each callee to ensure none call MHD_get_response_header.\n\n- Any function-pointer members (and their targets) declared inside MHD_HTTP_Res_Header or MHD_Response: If either struct contains function-pointer fields, those pointers (or initializers) and their potential targets must be inspected because indirect calls via such pointers could create recursion paths.\n\nThese symbols (and the transitive callees/function-pointer targets) are the minimal set required to determine whether a call path exists from MHD_get_response_header back to itself."
