  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function does not modify the response object or the headers it traverses, so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer types should be const-qualified when possible. In this routine the parameter and iterator could be declared as const struct MHD_Response *response and const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos. Assigning response->first_header (type struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *) to a const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header * is valid, iterating via pos = pos->next still works, and returning pos->value as a const char * is fine (implicit qualification to const). The only potential reason to keep the non-const types would be an external API/compatibility requirement or deliberate design decision; absent such justification, the code violates Rule 8.13."
