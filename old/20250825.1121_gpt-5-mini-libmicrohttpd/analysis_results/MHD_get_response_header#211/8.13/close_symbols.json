  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Response: required to know the exact type of response->first_header (is it a pointer-to-const or a plain pointer). That determines whether the traversal variable 'pos' should be a const pointer and whether the API already exposes header list as const-qualified.\n\n2) struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to see the declarations (types/const-qualification) of fields used in the function: header, header_size, value, next. In particular, whether header and value are declared as 'const char *' or 'char *' and whether next is 'struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *' or 'const struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *' \u2014 this is central to deciding if pointers should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule.\n\n3) MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (prototype): required to determine the const-correctness of its parameters (does it accept const char * or non-const char *?). If that function takes non-const pointers (or modifies its arguments), it may force non-const usage; if it takes const pointers, the function here can and should pass const-qualified pointers.\n\n(These symbols provide the precise pointer const-qualifications needed to decide whether pointers in MHD_get_response_header should be declared pointing-to-const per the MISRA guideline.)"
