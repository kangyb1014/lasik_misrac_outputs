Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be const-qualified when possible (e.g. 'const char *header'), so having it as 'char *' when it is only read constitutes a violation. (Note: if the header buffer is actually modified elsewhere, making it const may be infeasible; the violation applies when the object is effectively immutable and should be declared const.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_header:\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not proven correct. Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types when that is feasible for the overall design, but the supplied snippet alone does not demonstrate that the members are immutable everywhere. In the struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header the members are declared as char *header and char *value; converting those declarations to const char * would only be required if none of the codebase ever modifies the pointed-to buffers. The shown function only reads those members (and returning pos->value as const char * is legal and good practice), but a single read-only use does not prove the object can be made const globally. Without examining all creation/assignment/modification sites for header/value, you cannot conclude a MISRA 8.13 violation. If, after a whole-program review, header/value are never modified after initialization, then the struct should be updated to use const char * to comply with 8.13. As reported, there is insufficient evidence, so the claim is not correct."
