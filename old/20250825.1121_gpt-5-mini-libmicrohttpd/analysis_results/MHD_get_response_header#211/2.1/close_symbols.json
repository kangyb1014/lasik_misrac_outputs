  "explanation": "To decide if any statement in MHD_get_response_header is unreachable you must reason about the control-flow and conditions in the function. That requires: (1) the MHD_Response definition to know the exact type and initialization/validity of response->first_header (if first_header can be non-NULL or always NULL, or has other invariants that make the loop body unreachable); (2) the MHD_HTTP_Res_Header definition (header_size, header, value, next) and any invariants (e.g. whether next ultimately becomes NULL or whether the list might be circular) to determine whether the for loop can ever iterate, terminate, or be infinite; (3) the MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ prototype/implementation and attributes to know its return semantics and whether it can be noreturn/longjmp/abort or is guaranteed to return a boolean value \u2014 this affects whether the return inside the loop is reachable or whether subsequent code is unreachable; (4) strlen contract to ensure computing key_size cannot produce unexpected control flow or side effects in this project build; and (5) any higher-level invariants/constructors that guarantee relationships (for example header_size always equals strlen(header) or header_size has constrained values) \u2014 such invariants can make the (pos->header_size == key_size) test always true/false and therefore make branches/statements provably unreachable. These symbols and contracts are necessary to prove or disprove that any statement in the function cannot be executed under any valid program state (MISRA unreachable-code analysis)."
