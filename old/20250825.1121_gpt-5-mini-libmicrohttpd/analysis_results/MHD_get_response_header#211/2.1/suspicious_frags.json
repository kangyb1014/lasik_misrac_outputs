  "explanation": "I found no code fragment that is unreachable in this function. Reasons: \n- The early return if (NULL == key) is an explicitly reachable branch when the caller passes key == NULL. The subsequent key_size = strlen(key) is only executed when key is non-NULL, so it is reachable and correct in flow.\n- The for loop (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next) may execute zero or more times depending on the list contents; both the loop body (when a match is found) and the final return NULL (when no match is found or the list is empty) are reachable.\n- The in-loop return (return pos->value;) is reachable whenever a matching header is present; there is no code after that return other than the final return, so there is no dead tail code.\n- There are no constant-true/false conditionals, duplicated returns that make subsequent statements impossible, or statements following unconditional jumps (goto/return/exit) that would be impossible to reach.\n\nNote: Although there is no unreachable code, the function does not validate that response is non-NULL before dereferencing response->first_header; that is a potential runtime/undefined-behavior issue but it is not an instance of unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
