  "explanation": "No other code fragments need investigation for Rule 21.14. The remaining lines are declarations, a NULL check for key, the for-loop control (iteration over response->first_header and pos = pos->next), and the final return NULL \u2014 none perform binary comparisons or call string/binary comparison routines. No direct use of memcmp (or other comparison functions that could compare null-terminated strings) appears elsewhere in this function, so only the above fragments (which obtain the length of a null-terminated string and compare binary data against that string) warrant investigation."
