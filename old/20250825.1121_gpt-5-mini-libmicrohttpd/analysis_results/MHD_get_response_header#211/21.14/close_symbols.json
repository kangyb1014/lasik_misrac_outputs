  "explanation": "- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: The target function delegates the comparison to this routine. To determine whether memcmp is being used to compare a null\u2011terminated string (a MISRA violation), you must inspect this function's implementation.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. If MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (or any callee) calls memcmp with one or both arguments being null\u2011terminated strings (e.g. 'key'), that is the direct rule violation; memcmp must therefore be examined.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The code relies on pos->header, pos->header_size, pos->value and pos->next. You need the complete definition to know the exact types and semantics (is header a char* or binary buffer? is header_size the length of a C string or a binary length?). If header is a null\u2011terminated C string and header_size is derived from strlen(header), using memcmp would violate the rule.\n- struct MHD_Response: The function reads response->first_header. The definition lets you confirm linkage and types (that first_header points to MHD_HTTP_Res_Header) so you can trace what pos->header actually refers to.\n- All functions called by MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: That helper may call other comparison routines (strncasecmp, strncmp, tolower, memcmp, etc.). You must inspect those transitive callees to see if any of them use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- strlen: The target function uses strlen(key) which implies key is expected to be null\u2011terminated. Including strlen (declaration/semantics) makes explicit that 'key' is a C string; this matters because using memcmp with a length derived from strlen(key) against another C string is the specific misuse MISRA warns about.\n\nProvide the source/definitions of the above symbols to the next analyst so they can determine whether memcmp is used (directly or transitively) to compare null\u2011terminated strings in this call path."
