  "explanation": "For checking use of compiler language extensions you must examine any macros, attributes or non\u2011standard declarations that could expand to compiler\u2011specific constructs and the types/fields used by the function. _MHD_EXTERN: this macro may expand to compiler\u2011specific storage\u2011class/attribute syntax (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec) \u2014 needed to decide if an extension is used. struct MHD_Response: required to inspect the declaration of response->first_header (and any attributes on the struct) which could use extensions. struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to inspect header_size, header, value, next member declarations (they may be bitfields, flexible array members, or carry attributes/extension syntax). MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: this identifier may be a macro, inline function or annotated with compiler attributes or use extension syntax \u2014 must inspect its definition/declaration. pos->header_size, pos->header, pos->value, pos->next: the exact member types and any member\u2011level attributes/bitfields/flexible arrays must be known to detect extension usage (they are part of the struct but listed explicitly to emphasise needed members). strlen: the declaration/macro for strlen could be an implementation macro/wrapper to a builtin \u2014 include to verify no extension is invoked by this call. NULL and size_t: their definitions (from stddef.h/stdlib headers) are needed to ensure they are not implemented using non\u2011standard constructs. These symbols collectively allow determining whether any compiler\u2011specific extensions are being used in the target function (via macros, attributes, nonstandard declarations, bitfields, flexible arrays, reserved identifier usage, etc.)."
