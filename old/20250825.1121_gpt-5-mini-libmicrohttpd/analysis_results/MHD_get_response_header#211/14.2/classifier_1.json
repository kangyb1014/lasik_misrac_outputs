  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_header:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *key)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n  size_t key_size;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n    return NULL;\n\n  key_size = strlen (key);\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_size) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos->value;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_header:\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n{\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the header (key), without the colon.\n   */\n  char *header;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a header, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t header_size;\n\n  /**\n   * The value of the header.\n   */\n  char *value;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a value, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t value_size;\n\n  /**\n   * Type of the value.\n   */\n  enum MHD_ValueKind kind;\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The for loop is well-formed: the loop counter is the single identifier 'pos' which is initialized in the first clause (pos = response->first_header), the second clause (NULL != pos) has no persistent side-effects and uses only the loop counter, and the third clause (pos = pos->next) modifies only the loop counter. The loop body and the called function MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ only read the header fields and do not modify the list nodes, so no object used in the second/third clauses is modified in the body. (If any called function or the loop body were to modify the list nodes or pos itself, that would violate Rule 14.2.)"
