  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if ((pos->header_size == key_size) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))",
    "key_size = strlen (key);"
  ],
  "explanation": "No other calls to functions from <string.h> appear in this function. The leading NULL check (if (NULL == key) return NULL;) prevents strlen being called with a NULL pointer. The loop and the explicit comparison pos->header_size == key_size mean the explicit binary comparison is performed only when lengths match. Other statements (variable declarations, loop control, returns, and accessing response->first_header) do not invoke <string.h> string handling functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17; they therefore do not need further investigation for this specific rule. Note: dereferencing response without checking it for NULL is a potential general safety issue, but it is not a string.h-related Rule 21.17 concern and so is not included above."
