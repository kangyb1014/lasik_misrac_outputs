  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis:\n\n- strlen (from <string.h>): MHD_get_response_header calls strlen(key). To determine if that call can read beyond the bounds of the object pointed to by key you must know the precise semantics of strlen (how it scans until a NUL) and verify the preconditions on key (is it guaranteed to be a valid NUL-terminated buffer of sufficient extent by callers). Without considering strlen behavior you cannot conclude whether reading key is safe.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (function/implementation): The function is called with pos->header, key and pos->header_size. To ensure no out-of-bounds access you must inspect this routine's prototype/implementation to verify it only accesses exactly the provided length n (pos->header_size) or otherwise bounds checks its inputs, and whether it requires NUL-termination of either pointer. If that routine reads beyond the provided length or expects NUL-termination, additional risks arise.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): The code reads response->first_header. You need the struct definition to confirm types (pointer vs array), possible invariants, and whether first_header can be NULL or non-initialized. This affects whether the loop and dereferences of pos are valid.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): The function dereferences pos->header, pos->header_size, pos->next and returns pos->value. You must know the exact types of these fields and any documented invariants (for example whether header points to a buffer of at least header_size bytes, whether header is NUL-terminated, whether header_size is the byte-count excluding/including any terminator). Those semantics determine whether MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ and any other reads are in-bounds.\n\n- functions that construct/populate response headers (e.g. MHD_add_response_header or other header-creation routines): To prove that pos->header and pos->header_size satisfy the invariants needed for safe access, you must inspect the code/logic that creates and initializes MHD_HTTP_Res_Header objects. Those constructors/ mutators establish whether header_size accurately reflects available storage and whether header buffers are NUL-terminated. Without that you cannot conclude safety of reads that depend on header_size or on NUL-termination assumptions.\n\n- Public API contract / documentation for MHD_get_response_header (preconditions on the 'key' parameter): If callers of MHD_get_response_header are required by the API to pass a NUL-terminated string for key (or other constraints), that contract must be examined and enforced. MISRA analysis must consider caller-specified preconditions; if key is not required to be NUL-terminated by the API, strlen(key) could violate bounds.\n\nIn short: you must inspect strlen semantics, the implementation or contract of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, the exact layout and invariants of the response/header structs, the code that builds these headers, and the API preconditions on the key parameter to determine whether any string operations can read beyond the bounds of their operand objects."
