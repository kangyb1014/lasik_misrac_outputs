  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a MISRA no\u2011dead\u2011code analysis of MHD_get_response_header:\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - The function reads response->first_header. You must know the structure layout, invariants and possible special sentinel values to determine whether the for loop is ever entered or whether accessing first_header is undefined/has observable side effects. Also needed to reason about whether removal of the loop or function would change program behaviour.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n  - The loop inspects pos->header_size, pos->header, pos->value and follows pos->next. The field types, possible NULLness, whether fields are volatile or have semantics (e.g. lazy-populated, callbacks on access), and whether next can form self\u2011loops all affect reachability and whether the comparisons/return have observable effects. You need the definition to decide if any of the accessed fields or the traversal are dead.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_\n  - The equality routine is used in the conditional. To determine if that conditional (and therefore the return of pos->value) is dead you must know the function\u2019s semantics: does it have side effects (modifies buffers, global state, logging), does it always return a fixed value for given inputs, can it invoke callbacks, can it read beyond bounds (UB), etc. If it has observable side effects then the call is not removable even if its boolean result is predictable.\n\n- strlen\n  - The function calls strlen(key). Although standard, you must confirm its semantics (no side effects, behaviour on given key values) and whether its result is needed; if strlen has no side effects then computing key_size might be removable only if the comparison that uses it is also removable. Include it to justify whether the strlen call itself is dead.\n\n- callers of MHD_get_response_header (all call sites)\n  - MISRA dead code is a project\u2011level property. To decide if this function (or portions of it) is dead you must know whether any other translation unit ever calls it and whether those call sites rely on its observable behaviour (including timing). If there are no callers (or only callers whose behaviour is unaffected by removing the function), the whole function may be dead.\n\n- linkage/visibility of MHD_get_response_header (MHD_EXTERN and compilation units)\n  - The MHD_EXTERN linkage and possible external visibility (exported symbol, used by other modules or plugins) affects whether the function can be removed. You need symbol visibility/linker data to determine if it is reachable from outside the current compilation unit (e.g. dynamic linking, callbacks) and therefore not dead.\n\n- globals or side\u2011effecting symbols accessed/modified by MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_\n  - If the equality function touches global state, logging, locks, or other external resources, removal of the call would change program behaviour even if the boolean result is predictable. You must identify any globals or other functions that MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ uses/changes to judge removability.\n\n(Concise rationale: to prove an operation is dead you must show it produces no observable effect for all program executions. That requires the data layout and invariants (response/header structs), the semantics and side effects of called routines (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, strlen and any globals they touch), and the program\u2011level reachability/visibility (callers and linkage) so you can determine whether removing the code would alter behaviour.)"
