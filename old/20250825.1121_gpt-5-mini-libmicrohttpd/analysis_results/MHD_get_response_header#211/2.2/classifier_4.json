  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_response_header:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *key)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;\n  size_t key_size;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n    return NULL;\n\n  key_size = strlen (key);\n  for (pos = response->first_header;\n       NULL != pos;\n       pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((pos->header_size == key_size) &&\n        (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (pos->header, key, pos->header_size)))\n      return pos->value;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_header:\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "scenario": "The single struct member declaration 'void *crc_cls;' by itself is not an executed operation and therefore does not constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Removal of the declaration could change structure layout and program behaviour, so the declaration alone is not a violation. However, a violation could occur in a concrete scenario where assignments to this member are executed but the stored value is never subsequently used/read. Example violating scenario: elsewhere in the code the program always executes 'response->crc_cls = some_pointer;' but no code ever reads response->crc_cls (and removing those assignments would not affect program behaviour). Those executed assignments would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
