  "explanation": "I focused on fragments that are most likely to represent dead or redundant code in the provided snippets: (1) the identical duplicate definitions of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (two full function bodies appear in the additional code) \u2014 duplicate non-static definitions are suspicious (one may be redundant/unused or cause linkage problems) and should be investigated, and (2) members of the response/header structures that are not referenced in the shown MHD_get_response_header implementation (e.g. last_header, prev, the data/reader/upgrade/mutex/iovec related members). Those struct members may be legitimate and used elsewhere, but within the supplied context they are not accessed and therefore warrant review to ensure they are not dead (initialized or maintained without effect). Other fragments in the provided code were not included because they are actively used in the presented control flow: MHD_get_response_header local variables (pos, key_size), the loop that walks response->first_header via pos->next, the comparisons using pos->header_size and MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, and the final return NULL \u2014 these operations are executed and directly affect behavior and therefore are not candidates for dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2 based on the snippets supplied."
