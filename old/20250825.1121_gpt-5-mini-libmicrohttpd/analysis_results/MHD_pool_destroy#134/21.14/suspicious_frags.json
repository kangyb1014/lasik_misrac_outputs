  "explanation": "I examined the entire function MHD_pool_destroy. There are no calls to memcmp, nor to any string comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, memcmp) and no operations on null-terminated strings. The function only performs numeric assertions, memory unpoisoning, and memory deallocation (free, munmap, VirtualFree, abort). Macros referenced (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) and the is_mmap flag deal with memory and alignment, not string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
