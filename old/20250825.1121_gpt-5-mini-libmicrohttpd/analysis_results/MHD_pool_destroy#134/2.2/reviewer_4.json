Each invocation executes an operation that has no effect at runtime; removing the macro call would not change program behaviour.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s characterization is not correct. The macro _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is defined as (void)0, so each invocation expands to an expression statement with no side effects. Compilers will not emit code for such a statement, so there is no runtime operation that is executed and useless; in other words there is no emitted, executed code whose removal would change behaviour. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 targets code that is executed but could be removed without effect (i.e. useless code present in the binary/executed path). An assertion / instrumentation macro intentionally defined as a no-op in some builds is a preprocessor-level convenience and does not produce dead, executed code in the final program, so the call in MHD_pool_destroy is not a violation of Rule 2.2. If you want to avoid having the no-op invocation in releases for clarity, the proper approach is to change the macro definition or guard its uses with conditional compilation, but as written this is not a MISRA 2.2 breach."
