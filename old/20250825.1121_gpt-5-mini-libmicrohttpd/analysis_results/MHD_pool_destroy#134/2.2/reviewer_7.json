In that configuration the statement executes but has no effect and could be removed without changing program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code (Rule 2.2).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct for the shown project configuration. In the provided additional code the instrumentation macro is defined as a no-op: _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pointer, size) (void)0. That leaves an expression-statement in MHD_pool_destroy that is executed but has no effect; removing that statement would not change program behaviour. By the wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), this is dead code. Note that the situation is configuration-dependent: if the macro expands to real instrumentation code (e.g. sanitizer calls), the statement would not be dead. To avoid the violation in the no-instrumentation build, the project should ensure the macro expands to nothing at preprocessing time (so no statement is emitted) or guard the call with appropriate #if so that no no-op statement remains in the compiled code."
