  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains standard, conditionally executed statements that are not inherently unreachable and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1: the initial NULL check (if (NULL == pool) return;) intentionally exits early but is reachable when pool is NULL; the mhd_assert lines are assertions (may be compiled out in some builds) but do not create permanently unreachable code paths in the compiled program; _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and the final free(pool) are ordinary side-effecting calls that are reachable whenever pool is non-NULL. The only areas that can produce unreachable code (either at compile time due to preprocessor configuration or at runtime due to a possibly constant/controlled pool->is_mmap) are the memory-deallocation branch (the if/else on pool->is_mmap) and the platform-specific preprocessor branches (munmap / VirtualFree / abort), so those have been reported for investigation."
