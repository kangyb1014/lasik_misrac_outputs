  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/MSVC/Clang extension keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific language features.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...), #elif, #else, #endif) and use of platform APIs (munmap, VirtualFree) are standard preprocessor and OS API usage, not compiler language extensions.\n- Use of standard C types (uint8_t, size_t, bool) and ordinary macros (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, mhd_assert, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) are standard C constructs. (Note: identifiers beginning with an underscore and an uppercase letter are reserved by the C standard, but that is a naming/reserved-identifiers concern, not a compiler language-extension issue for MISRA C Rule 1.2.)\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
