  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter variable 'pool' itself (no assignment to pool). The rule prohibits modifying the pointer parameter value, but allows modification of the object it points to. In this function: - mhd_assert and ROUND_TO_ALIGN are used only in checks and do not change 'pool' or its pointer value. - _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is a no-op macro and does not modify 'pool'. - free(pool->memory), munmap/VirtualFree(pool->memory) release memory pointed to by a member; this modifies the object referred to by pool (allowed by the rule) but does not change the parameter pointer value. - free(pool) deallocates the object pointed to by the parameter but does not assign to or otherwise change the parameter variable 'pool'. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be investigated under that rule."
