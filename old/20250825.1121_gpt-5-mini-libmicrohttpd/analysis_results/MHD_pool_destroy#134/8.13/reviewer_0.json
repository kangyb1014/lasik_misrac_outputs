Specifically: if _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. void *addr, size_t len) but does not modify the pointed-to bytes (it only updates sanitizer/shadow metadata or inspects the region), then pool->memory should be a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *) and the API should accept a const void * parameter. In that situation the current use of a non-const pointer violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY actually modifies the contents of the memory region, or its signature already takes a const void *, then there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is speculative and cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone. MISRA R8.13 requires a pointer type to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is never modified; to decide whether this code violates R8.13 you must inspect:\n- the declaration of struct MemoryPool (the type of pool->memory),\n- the prototype/semantics of _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, and\n- any other code that writes-bytes through pool->memory.\nIn this function pool->memory is passed to _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and later passed to deallocation APIs (free/munmap/VirtualFree), which all take non-const void * parameters. If pool->memory is only ever read (and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY were declared to take a const void * and not modify the bytes), then R8.13 would suggest it should be declared as pointing-to-const. However, because deallocation APIs require a non-const void * (and because _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY may legitimately need a non-const parameter), the member is typically declared as void *; that choice is reasonable and not necessarily a R8.13 violation. Therefore, given only the provided code, the reported violation cannot be established. To confirm a violation you would need the Pool struct and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY prototype and to verify that the pointed-to bytes are never modified and no API requiring non-const exists."
