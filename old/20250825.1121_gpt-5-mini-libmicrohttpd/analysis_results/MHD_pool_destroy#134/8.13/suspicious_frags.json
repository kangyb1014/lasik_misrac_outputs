  "explanation": "All other lines in the function are control-flow, assertions, macro uses, or integer/size checks that do not declare or initialize pointer types and therefore cannot be made to point to const-qualified types. The only places where pointer type qualification could be relevant are the function parameter and the uses of the pool->memory/member passed to deallocation routines; these have been included above for investigation. Note that many of the non-selected statements merely read fields or perform control decisions and thus are not candidates for adding const qualifiers."
