  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C const-pointer analysis:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): The critical piece \u2014 the exact type of pool->memory (e.g. void *, char *, const void *, etc.) and the types of pool->size/pos/end/is_mmap determine whether the pointer can or should be const-qualified. You must see all field types and any existing const qualifiers in the struct.\n\n- MHD_pool_create (implementation/prototype): The allocator and all writers to pool->memory are typically in the create/usage code. To decide whether pool->memory could be const, we must see how the memory is obtained and whether it is subsequently written to (initialization, fills, buffer writes). If create (or other functions) write into the memory, const qualification is not appropriate.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (prototype/definition): This function/macro is invoked on pool->memory in destroy(). Its parameter types show whether it expects a writable pointer (e.g. void *addr) or could accept const void *. If it requires a non-const pointer, pool->memory cannot be const-qualified without casts.\n\n- free (prototype from <stdlib.h>): free(void *) accepts a non-const pointer. The presence of free(pool->memory) in destroy() is strong evidence that pool->memory must be non-const (or casts are used). Confirming the prototype is necessary to reason about required qualification.\n\n- munmap (prototype from <sys/mman.h>): munmap(void *addr, size_t) likewise accepts a non-const pointer. If memory is released with munmap, this affects whether pool->memory can be const.\n\n- VirtualFree (prototype from Windows API): VirtualFree(LPVOID, SIZE_T, DWORD) takes a non-const pointer. On Windows builds this call similarly constrains pointer qualification.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro/definition): ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos) is used in an assertion about pos alignment. While not directly about memory pointer constness, the macro/definition clarifies whether pos/end are pointer-sized/offset types (affecting whether memory is considered an immutable object or an internal mutable buffer). Knowing the exact types helps assess whether memory is an internal buffer that is modified.\n\n- definitions of types used in MemoryPool (e.g. size_t, uintptr_t, bool/char for is_mmap): To reason precisely about pointer qualification you need the underlying type definitions (size_t, integer-width typedefs) used in the struct and function prototypes, and the exact type of is_mmap flag to ensure correct interpretation of code paths (free vs. munmap/VirtualFree).\n\nNote: The listed symbols let the analyst determine whether pool->memory is ever used as a modifiable buffer or passed to APIs that require non-const pointers. If pool->memory is written to anywhere (in create or other pool users) or passed to APIs taking non-const void *, it must not be const-qualified. Conversely, if it is only ever read and passed to const-accepting APIs, const qualification could be applied."
