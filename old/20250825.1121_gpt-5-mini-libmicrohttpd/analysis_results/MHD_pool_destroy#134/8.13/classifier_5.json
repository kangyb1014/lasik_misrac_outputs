  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call free(pool->memory) does not itself contravene Rule 8.13 because the rule concerns pointer declarations (they should be const-qualified where possible). pool->memory must be a pointer to mutable allocated memory (compatible with void *) to be freed; making it const would prevent correct use with free without casting. A specific violation scenario would be if pool->memory were declared as a non-const pointer (for example 'char *memory') but the program never modifies the pointed-to bytes \u2014 in that case the pointer should have been declared as 'const char *' and the non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13."
