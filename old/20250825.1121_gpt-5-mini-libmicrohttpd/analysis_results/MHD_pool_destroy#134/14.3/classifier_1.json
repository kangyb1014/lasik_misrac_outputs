  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression in the mhd_assert depends on the runtime value pool->pos (it compares pool->pos with ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos)), so it is not an invariant constant expression. This is a runtime consistency check, not a constant controlling expression. (Only if ROUND_TO_ALIGN were somehow a compile-time constant independent of pool->pos would the expression be invariant and thus violate the rule.)"
