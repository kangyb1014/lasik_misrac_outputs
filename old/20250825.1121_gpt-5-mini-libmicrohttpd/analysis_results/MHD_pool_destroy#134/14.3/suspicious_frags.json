  "explanation": "Only selection/iteration controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The fragments above include all instances in this function that either are direct controlling expressions (the two if statements) or are macros (mhd_assert) that commonly expand to conditional checks and therefore should be inspected for invariant conditions after macro expansion. The preprocessor conditional block around the platform-specific deallocation is included because it determines which runtime branch is compiled in; its effect on invariance should be checked in the build configurations. Other lines in the function (calls such as _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, free(pool), the individual memory-deallocation calls when treated as statements, local expressions that are not controlling expressions, and non-conditional macro uses) do not introduce controlling expressions and thus do not need investigation under Rule 14.3."
