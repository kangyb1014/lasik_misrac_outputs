  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the expression depends on runtime structure members (pool->size, pool->end, pool->pos) and is therefore not invariant. This is an assertion, not a constant controlling expression. It would only violate Rule 14.3 if the expression could be proven to be a compile\u2011time constant (which is not the case here)."
