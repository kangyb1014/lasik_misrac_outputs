  "explanation": "For verifying whether MHD_pool_destroy can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by any string.h functions (memcpy/memset/etc.), the analyzer must know how the pool's memory pointer and size are defined and used and whether any callee invoked on those members uses string.h functions. Each symbol is required for the following reason:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition \u2014 fields: pos, end, size, memory, is_mmap)\n  - Needed to determine types, units and semantics of pos/end/size (offsets vs pointers), and the type and provenance of memory. To check any string.h call against object bounds you must know the actual object referenced and its length.\n\n- MHD_pool_create\n  - Shows how pool->memory and pool->size are allocated/initialized. You must confirm that pool->memory points to an object at least pool->size bytes long (so any memset/memcpy of pool->size is in\u2011bounds).\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN\n  - The function asserts pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos). Knowing the macro/func semantics (alignment and potential arithmetic) is necessary to ensure the asserts meaningfully constrain pos/end and do not hide integer overflow or unit mismatches that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY\n  - This call operates on (pool->memory, pool->size). Its implementation may call memset or other memory functions from string.h (or otherwise touch the region). You must inspect it to see whether it invokes any string.h functions and whether it could access beyond pool->size.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The asserts constrain pos/end/size. You need the assert implementation (macro) to know whether these checks are active in the build being analyzed (they may be no\u2011ops in some builds) and thus whether the invariants can be relied upon when reasoning about bounds.\n\n- free\n  - Although unlikely to call string.h functions, include the standard free prototype to confirm it does not access pool->memory beyond the object and to document the expected lifetime semantics (pointer becomes invalid after free).\n\n- munmap\n  - When MAP_ANONYMOUS branch is used, munmap(pool->memory, pool->size) is invoked. Confirm munmap semantics and ensure no intermediate wrapper calls string.h functions or otherwise access memory with wrong length.\n\n- VirtualFree\n  - On Windows branch VirtualFree(pool->memory, 0, MEM_RELEASE) is used. Include to verify it doesn't use string.h functions on the supplied pointer/size and to understand lifetime/validity concerns.\n\n- abort\n  - Present in the #else branch. Include to understand control flow and that in some configurations execution will terminate rather than attempt other memory operations.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32\n  - The conditional compilation macros determine which system API (munmap vs VirtualFree vs abort) is compiled. The chosen branch affects which functions operate on pool->memory/size; you must know which branch is active for the build being analyzed to inspect the corresponding callee implementation for any string.h usage.\n\nIn short: primary concerns are (1) whether any invoked helper (_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY or system wrappers) use string.h functions on pool->memory/pool->size, and (2) whether pool->memory/pool->size are valid and correctly sized \u2014 which requires the MemoryPool layout and its creator (MHD_pool_create). The other symbols are needed to resolve control flow and to ensure no hidden string.h usages or lifetime/size mismatches exist."
