  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls).\n\nReasoning:\n- The function body does not contain any textually visible call to MHD_pool_destroy (no direct recursion).\n- The provided macros expand to no function calls: mhd_assert -> ((void)0), _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY -> (void)0, ROUND_TO_ALIGN -> arithmetic expression. These cannot introduce indirect calls to MHD_pool_destroy.\n- The remaining calls are to standard runtime/OS functions (free, munmap, VirtualFree, abort). In C these do not invoke user-defined callbacks or destructors and do not call back into program functions such as MHD_pool_destroy, so they cannot create indirect recursion.\n- There are no function-pointer calls, callbacks, or other constructs in this fragment that could hide an indirect call path to MHD_pool_destroy.\n\nTherefore no code fragment in the provided function needs investigation for violating Rule 17.2."
