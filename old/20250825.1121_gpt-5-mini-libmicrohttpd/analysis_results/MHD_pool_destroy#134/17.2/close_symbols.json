  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_pool_destroy participates in any direct or indirect recursion you must examine all functions (and macros) it invokes to see if any path can lead back to MHD_pool_destroy. The following symbols are required because they are invoked (directly or via macros) in MHD_pool_destroy and could, in principle, call back into MHD_pool_destroy or other functions that eventually do so:\n\n- mhd_assert: Called twice in the function. Its implementation may call logging, error-handling, or abort-like routines (and those routines might call other library/daemon functions). You must inspect mhd_assert (and the functions it calls) to prove it does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_pool_destroy.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: Used in an assertion expression. It may be a macro or inline function; if it expands to a function call, that function must be checked for any calls back to MHD_pool_destroy.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: Called to unpoison memory (likely a macro or helper). Its body must be inspected to ensure it does not call MHD_pool_destroy (directly or indirectly).\n\n- free: Standard library deallocation is called when pool->is_mmap is false. Although libc free is not expected to call application functions, you must confirm the used free implementation (or any overriding allocator hooks) cannot call into MHD_pool_destroy.\n\n- munmap: Called on POSIX mmap'd memory (conditional build). Inspect munmap (or any wrapper used in this project) to ensure it cannot call back into MHD_pool_destroy.\n\n- VirtualFree: Called on Windows builds. Inspect VirtualFree or any project wrapper to ensure it does not call into MHD_pool_destroy.\n\n- abort: Called in the fallback #else branch. Inspect abort (or project-provided replacement) to ensure it does not indirectly re-enter MHD_pool_destroy.\n\nNote: The goal is to explore the callee graph starting at MHD_pool_destroy. If any of the above symbols call other project functions, those functions must also be examined transitively until you can prove no path returns to MHD_pool_destroy. The listed symbols are the immediate ones required to start that analysis."
