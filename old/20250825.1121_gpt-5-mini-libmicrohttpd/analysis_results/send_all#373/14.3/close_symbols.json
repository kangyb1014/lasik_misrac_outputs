A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For determining whether any controlling expression in send_all is invariant (MISRA rule), the following additional symbols are required and why:\n\n- send: The loop progress depends on the value returned in ret (ssize_t) from send. You must know the exact function prototype and return-value semantics on the target platform (when it returns >0, 0, or -1 and what conditions produce those returns) to decide if off will advance or become stuck (invariant). Also platform differences (POSIX vs Win32) change the third-parameter type and return semantics.\n\n- errno: The code tests errno after a negative return. You need to know errno is the variable consulted and whether it is set by send in the situations of interest (and whether other calls could clobber it). Its semantics affect whether the EAGAIN branch can be taken repeatedly, which could make the loop condition effectively invariant.\n\n- EAGAIN: The code compares errno to EAGAIN. You must know the meaning/conditions of EAGAIN on the target platform (and whether send can set it for blocking sockets) to determine if the EAGAIN branch (which sets ret=0 and continue) can occur and cause the loop to stall.\n\n- make_blocking: This function is invoked before the loop. Its implementation is required to determine whether the socket is indeed made blocking (preventing EAGAIN) or not; if it fails or leaves the socket non-blocking, send may repeatedly yield EAGAIN causing off not to change and making the for-condition invariant (infinite loop).\n\n- MHD_socket: The socket type alias may map to different native types (int on POSIX, SOCKET on Win32). That influences which send overload is used and platform-specific behavior/return semantics; this affects whether send can return 0 or EAGAIN in practice.\n\n- ssize_t: The type of ret is ssize_t. Its signedness and width matter for the comparisons (0 > ret) and the cast to size_t in the increment. Understanding ssize_t semantics avoids misinterpreting sign/overflow behavior that could make the control expression invariant.\n\n- run_usock and ws_send_frame (callers): To fully decide whether the controlling expression can be invariant in real use you must inspect the call sites: what buf/len values are passed, and whether callers guarantee conditions (e.g., len==0 or other preconditions) that make the loop not execute or make the controlling expression trivially false/true. Call-site context can change whether the loop condition is effectively invariant in actual usage.\n\nCollectively, these symbols provide the runtime and platform semantics needed to decide whether the for-loop controlling expression (and other controlling tests using ret/errno) can remain invariant (leading to an unintended infinite loop) or are safely variant under the intended environment."
