  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Details:\n- sock: only passed to make_blocking(sock) and send(sock,...); the local variable sock is not assigned to or incremented anywhere.\n- buf: used for indexing (&buf[off]) and passed to send. The code does not assign to buf (no buf = ... or buf++). Using &buf[off] computes an address but does not modify the pointer parameter itself; additionally buf is declared const so its pointee is not modified here.\n- len: only read in comparisons and arithmetic (len - off) and cast for the send call; len is never assigned to.\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code. (Other issues, e.g. the size_t-to-int cast on Windows, are unrelated to Rule 17.8.)"
