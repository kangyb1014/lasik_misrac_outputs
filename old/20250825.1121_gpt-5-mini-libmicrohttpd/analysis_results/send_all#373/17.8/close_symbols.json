  "explanation": "You must confirm that none of the parameter objects of send_all are being reassigned/modified implicitly by callees or macros. For the MISRA rule check these symbols are needed for the following reasons:\n\n- make_blocking: It is called with the parameter sock. If make_blocking is a macro (or function-like macro) that expands into code that assigns to the local parameter identifier 'sock' in send_all, that would be a direct violation. Even if it is a function, its prototype/implementation clarifies whether any surprising macro behavior or inlined code could modify the parameter variable itself.\n\n- send: The call to send might be a macro on some platforms. If send is a macro that expands into code that assigns to one of the parameter variables (sock, buf, len) in send_all, that would constitute modifying a function parameter. Knowing the actual declaration/macro definition rules out such cases.\n\n- MHD_socket: This typedef tells whether sock is a scalar (e.g. int) or a pointer type. If it is a pointer type, you must still distinguish between modifying the object it points to (allowed) versus reassigning the parameter variable sock itself (disallowed). The typedef plus callee definitions help determine if any callees perform an assignment to the parameter variable via macros.\n\n- ssize_t and size_t: Their definitions confirm the signed/unsigned widths and the behaviour of casts (ret cast to size_t in the loop increment). While the rule concerns parameter modification, incorrect casts or implicit conversions could mask code that attempts to assign into a parameter-sized object; these types are needed to reason precisely about the ret->off arithmetic and to ensure no hidden assignment to len occurs.\n\n- errno and EAGAIN: The code branches on errno == EAGAIN. errno may be a macro (thread-local accessor) or lvalue; EAGAIN is a macro constant. Their definitions ensure no surprising side-effectful macros are used here that could reassign function parameters (unlikely, but must be ruled out).\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: The conditional controls whether the length argument to send is size_t or cast to int. The active branch can change the call-site token sequence (and therefore could interact with macros like send). You need to know which branch applies in the target build to inspect the exact expansion/signature used and rule out macro-based parameter modification.\n\nIn short: inspect these symbols to ensure no macro expansions or typedefs cause an assignment to the formal parameters (sock, buf, len) inside send_all; only then can you conclude whether send_all violates the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
