  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only pointer parameter is declared as const (const char *buf) and the code takes &buf[off], which is a pointer to const char \u2014 there are no local non-const pointer variables or pointer assignments that drop const qualification. The call to send is passed a pointer-to-const; on typical platforms send is declared to accept a const-qualified buffer parameter (const void * or const char *), so no const is discarded here. No other pointers appear in this function (make_blocking and MHD_socket are not pointer variables in this code). Therefore there are no places in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
