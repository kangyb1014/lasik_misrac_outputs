  "explanation": "1) send (platform prototypes): You must know the exact parameter types of send on the target platforms because the MISRA rule under review concerns whether pointers are const-qualified when possible. On POSIX send is declared roughly as: ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags); on Windows (Winsock) it is declared roughly as: int send(SOCKET s, const char *buf, int len, int flags); the const-qualification on the buffer parameter is what matters. The code calls send(&buf[off]) where buf is const char*. If a platform's send prototype takes a non-const buffer pointer (char * or void * without const), that affects whether the function call violates/needs a cast or change to satisfy the MISRA guideline. Include prototypes for both POSIX and Windows builds because the source has a platform conditional.  \n\n2) ssize_t (return type of send on POSIX): The function uses ssize_t ret and depends on the return type of send. While not directly about pointer constness, knowing the exact send return type is needed to confirm there is no implicit conversion or mismatched prototype that could indicate a different send declaration (which might also affect the buffer parameter's declaration). Also different headers/typedefs on some platforms can indicate a different send prototype.  \n\n3) SOCKET / int (Windows socket type) and MHD_socket typedef/mapping: The code uses MHD_socket for the socket parameter; on Windows the native socket type is SOCKET and on POSIX it is int. To be certain which send prototype is being invoked (and therefore which buffer parameter type applies) you need the mapping/typedef of MHD_socket to the underlying socket type used on each platform. This ensures the correct platform-specific send prototype is considered when judging const-qualification compliance."
