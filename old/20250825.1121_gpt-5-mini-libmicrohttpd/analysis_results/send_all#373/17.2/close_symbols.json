  "explanation": "- make_blocking: Called directly by send_all. You must inspect its body to verify it does not (directly or indirectly) call send_all, run_usock, ws_send_frame or any other function that could form a call-cycle back to send_all.\n- run_usock: Listed as a caller of send_all and a caller of ws_send_frame. Inspecting run_usock is required to determine whether there exists a path run_usock -> ... -> send_all and whether any functions it calls lead back to run_usock/send_all (i.e., to detect indirect recursion involving send_all).\n- ws_send_frame: Calls send_all and is called by run_usock. Its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call, directly or indirectly, run_usock or make_blocking in a way that creates a cycle involving send_all.\n- ws_receive_frame: Called by run_usock. Although not directly in the minimal chain shown, it could contain calls that lead back to run_usock or send_all and thus participate in indirect recursion \u2014 it must be examined.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Called by run_usock. Like ws_receive_frame, it could call back into run_usock/ws_send_frame/send_all and thus must be inspected for possible indirect recursion.\n\n(Other lower-level functions such as the system send() or errno handling are irrelevant to detecting direct/indirect recursion and therefore are not required for this MISRA C rule analysis.)"
