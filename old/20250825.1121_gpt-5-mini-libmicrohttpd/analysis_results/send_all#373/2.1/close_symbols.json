  "explanation": "- make_blocking: must know what this function does and whether it can fail or leave the socket non\u2011blocking. The code assumes the socket is blocking; if make_blocking can fail or not actually make the socket blocking, the branch that checks for EAGAIN (and the associated continue) may be reachable. If it always succeeds, that branch may be unreachable.\n- send: need the exact platform semantics and prototype (return type and error behavior). On POSIX send returns ssize_t and sets errno on error (including EAGAIN for non\u2011blocking sockets). On Windows send has different semantics (returns int/SOCKET_ERROR and uses WSAGetLastError). Determining whether the if (0 > ret), if (0 == ret), and errno==EAGAIN checks are reachable requires the real send behavior for the build target.\n- errno: to know whether send reports EAGAIN via errno on the target platform or whether another API (WSAGetLastError) is used. The code compares errno to EAGAIN, so errno semantics matter for reachability.\n- EAGAIN: the value/availability of this macro on the target platform and whether send may set it in the code path in question. If EAGAIN cannot be produced for blocking sockets or on the target platform, that branch is unreachable.\n- MHD_socket: typedef/underlying type of MHD_socket (e.g., int on POSIX, SOCKET on Windows). This affects which send overload is used and whether error reporting uses errno or WSAGetLastError, which in turn affects branch reachability.\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: the preprocessor macros determine which compile\u2011time branch is selected (the code already branches on these macros for the length argument). Knowledge of the defined macros for the build target is required to decide which code is actually compiled and therefore which code can be unreachable.\n- WSAGetLastError and WSAEWOULDBLOCK: on Windows, send error information comes from WSAGetLastError and the equivalent error for would\u2011block is WSAEWOULDBLOCK, not errno/EAGAIN. To decide if the errno==EAGAIN check is unreachable on Windows, these symbols and semantics must be known.\n- ssize_t and size_t: definitions of these integer types (signedness/width) are needed to reason about the for\u2011loop increment and casts (off += (size_t) ret) and whether certain cast/overflow behavior could make branches effectively unreachable or introduce undefined behavior that affects reachability analysis."
