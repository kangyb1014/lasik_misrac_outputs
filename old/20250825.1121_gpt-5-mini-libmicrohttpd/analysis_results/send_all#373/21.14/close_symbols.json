  "explanation": "make_blocking \u2014 callee of send_all; its body must be inspected to ensure it does not call memcmp (a memcmp call inside a callee would make the target function transitively violate the MISRA rule). send \u2014 the named socket send function used in send_all; include its symbol/prototype to confirm it is not a macro or wrapper that expands to or calls memcmp (i.e., to rule out a hidden memcmp use). memcmp \u2014 the Standard Library function the MISRA rule targets; presence of calls to this symbol in send_all or any called functions indicates potential violation and must be searched for. ws_send_frame and run_usock \u2014 callers of send_all that supply the buf/len arguments; inspect them to determine the provenance and semantic type of the buffer (whether it holds null\u2011terminated strings). If buf originates as or is documented as a NUL\u2011terminated C string, a memcmp use found in the call tree may constitute a violation."
