First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of send_all.\n```c\nstatic void\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock,\n          const char *buf,\n          size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  make_blocking (sock);\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n    ret = send (sock,\n                &buf[off],\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n                len - off,\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n                (int) (len - off),\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n                0);\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe third clause of the for statement uses the variable 'ret' (off += (size_t) ret), but 'ret' is assigned inside the loop body (ret = send(...)). Clause 3 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not to use objects that are modified in the loop body. Therefore the loop is not well\u2011formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function send_all:\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n...\ntypedef int MHD_socket\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for statement\u2019s third clause is off += (size_t) ret, which uses the identifier ret. That object is assigned to inside the loop body (ret = send(...); and ret = 0;), so the third clause uses an object that is modified in the for loop body. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not to use objects modified in the loop body, therefore this loop is not well\u2011formed under Rule 14.2."
