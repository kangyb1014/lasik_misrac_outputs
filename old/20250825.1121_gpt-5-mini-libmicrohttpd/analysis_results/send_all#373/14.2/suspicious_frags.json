  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the for-loop header and any statements that modify or set the variable used in the loop-update expression need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The problematic pattern is that the third clause of the for statement uses the object 'ret' (off += (size_t) ret) while 'ret' is assigned/modified inside the loop body (ret = send(...), ret = 0 on EAGAIN). That violates the clause that the third clause shall modify only the loop counter and shall not use objects that are modified in the loop body. \n\nOther code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: the first clause (off = 0) properly initializes the single loop counter; the second clause (off < len) uses only the loop counter and len (which is not modified in the loop body); the loop counter 'off' itself is not modified inside the body; declarations of types and the make_blocking call are unrelated to the for-statement well-formedness requirement. The cast (size_t) ret is part of the third clause issue already reported. Therefore only the listed fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.2 compliance."
