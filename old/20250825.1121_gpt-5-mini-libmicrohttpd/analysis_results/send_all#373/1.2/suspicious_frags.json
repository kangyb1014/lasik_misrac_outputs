  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, or other vendor extensions).\n- The conditional preprocessor use of _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__ relies on implementation-provided macros to select platform-appropriate code; these are not language extensions themselves but standard practice for portability.\n- All casts and types used (size_t, ssize_t, int) are standard C or common platform typedefs provided by system headers; nothing in the snippet invokes a compiler-specific language extension as described in compiler documentation.\n- No inline assembly, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or other documented compiler extensions are present.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that require further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
