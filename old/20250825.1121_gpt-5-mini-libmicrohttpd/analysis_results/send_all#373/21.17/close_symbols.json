  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required to check the MISRA <string.h> rule for send_all:\n\n- make_blocking: send_all calls make_blocking(sock). Even though it only takes the socket, its body must be inspected to ensure it does not perform any string.h operations on buffers potentially related to this socket or global buffers that could affect buffer lifetime/contents passed to send_all.\n\n- send: send_all calls the system send() function with &buf[off] and a length. To reason about out-of-bounds accesses you must know the exact prototype and semantics of send on the target platform (size argument type, behavior on partial sends, error handling). On native Windows the code casts len-off to (int) \u2014 you must confirm the platform-specific signature and whether truncation could cause incorrect length calculations that lead to reads beyond the intended buffer.\n\n- errno: send_all checks errno for EAGAIN on a failing send. The value/usage of errno is needed to understand the error path and whether the loop resumes safely or could leave off/len inconsistent causing later out-of-bounds usage.\n\n- EAGAIN: The specific error macro compared against errno controls the recovery path (ret = 0; continue). Understanding its semantics is necessary to reason about whether the loop can loop indefinitely or change off/ret in a way that leads to an out-of-bounds access.\n\n- MHD_socket: The typedef/representation of MHD_socket may be needed to confirm any platform-dependent behaviour or casts performed in make_blocking/send that could indirectly affect buffer usage or ABI/size assumptions.\n\n- ssize_t and size_t: send_all manipulates ssize_t (ret) and size_t (off, len) and mixes signed/unsigned arithmetic and casts (notably casting to (int) on Windows). Exact widths and signedness are required to prove that off and len arithmetic cannot under/overflow and cause out-of-bounds accesses when computing &buf[off] or the length passed to send.\n\n- run_usock and ws_send_frame: These are the static callers of send_all. To determine whether send_all can cause or be involved in a <string.h> bounds violation you must inspect the callers to see how they allocate and populate buf and compute len. The callers may use string.h functions (memcpy/strlen/etc.) to build the buffer; those calls and their correctness determine whether buf/len passed into send_all are valid and bounded.\n\n- string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): The MISRA rule applies to these functions. If any of the caller or callee code (run_usock, ws_send_frame, make_blocking or other transitive functions) use any of these functions to build or modify the buffer passed to send_all, you must examine their uses to ensure they do not access beyond buffer bounds. Therefore, obtain the definitions/usages of these specific string.h functions in the callers/callees for the full analysis.\n\nIn summary: to determine if the MISRA <string.h> rule is violated in the context of send_all you need (1) the platform signature/semantics of send and integer-width/type information (ssize_t/size_t/MHD_socket), (2) errno/EAGAIN behaviour for loop control, (3) the bodies of callers (run_usock, ws_send_frame) and make_blocking to see how buf/len are produced and whether any string.h functions are used incorrectly there, and (4) the actual uses of the string.h functions (listed) in those code paths."
