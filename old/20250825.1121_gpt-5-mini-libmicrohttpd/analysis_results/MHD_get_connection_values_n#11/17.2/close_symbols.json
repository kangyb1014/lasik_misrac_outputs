  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol:\n\n- MHD_KeyValueIteratorN: This typedef (the function\u2011pointer type) is needed to resolve what concrete functions can legally be invoked via the iterator parameter and to verify signature compatibility. Without it you cannot determine the set of possible call targets of the function\u2011pointer call site inside MHD_get_connection_values_n.\n\n- All functions that are ever passed as the 'iterator' argument to MHD_get_connection_values_n (their definitions): Indirect recursion can occur if any of these iterator-target functions (directly or indirectly) call back into MHD_get_connection_values_n. You must inspect each of those function bodies to detect such a cycle.\n\n- All call sites of MHD_get_connection_values_n (caller function names and the actual iterator argument expressions): To detect indirect recursion you need to know who calls MHD_get_connection_values_n and which iterator functions they pass. The exact iterator argument expressions at each call site resolve which concrete functions may be invoked.\n\n- Definitions of the caller functions of MHD_get_connection_values_n: Those callers may form part of an indirect recursion cycle (caller -> MHD_get_connection_values_n -> iterator-target -> ... -> caller). Examining the caller bodies is necessary to check for such cycles.\n\n- Transitive callee closures of the functions listed above: A recursion cycle may be indirect and span multiple functions. You must follow the call graph transitively from iterator-targets and from callers to see whether MHD_get_connection_values_n is reachable again.\n\n- Any global or structure variables that hold or are assigned function pointers of type MHD_KeyValueIteratorN: If iterator targets are stored in globals/structs and later used as arguments, you must find those assignments to locate possible iterator-target functions.\n\n- (optional) MHD_NO: Not required to detect recursion, but included because it identifies the return convention of iterator functions; knowing the return type can help match candidate functions to the iterator type during resolution.\n\nIn short: to determine whether MHD_get_connection_values_n participates in direct or indirect recursion you must (1) resolve the function\u2011pointer call by identifying all possible iterator targets, (2) examine all callers of MHD_get_connection_values_n, and (3) traverse the transitive call graph (bodies/definitions) of those functions. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to perform that analysis."
