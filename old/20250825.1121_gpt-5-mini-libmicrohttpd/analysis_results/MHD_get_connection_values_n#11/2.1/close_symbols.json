  "explanation": "To decide whether any code in MHD_get_connection_values_n is unreachable you must know the concrete types and symbolic values that control the branches and loops:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (complete definition): the function reads connection and uses connection->rq; the full struct is required to know whether the rq member exists, its type, and any compile-time invariants that could make branches unreachable.\n\n- definition of the type of connection->rq (the struct that contains headers_received): the function iterates connection->rq.headers_received; you need the rq type to see the headers_received field type, its linkage and whether it can ever be populated (any static initializers or constness that would make the loop body unreachable).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (complete definition): the loop walks a linked list via pos->next and tests pos->kind and accesses header/value fields. The full definition (including types of next and kind) is necessary to determine whether pos can ever be non-NULL, whether pos->kind can have values that satisfy (kind & pos->kind), and whether members are available (otherwise code could be unreachable).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (full definition / bitmask values): the conditional 0 != (kind & pos->kind) depends on the possible bit values of kind and pos->kind. To determine if that test can ever be true (or always false) you must know the enumerators/bitmask definitions for MHD_ValueKind.\n\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIteratorN (function-pointer prototype and return type): the code branches depending on whether iterator is NULL and then calls iterator(iterator_cls,...). The prototype and return type are required to know whether NULL is a valid value, whether the call expression is well-formed, and what possible return values the iterator can produce.\n\n- definition of MHD_NO and the complete enumerated type or macros that define the iterator return values: the code compares the iterator return to MHD_NO. To know whether that branch (return ret;) can ever execute you must know what MHD_NO means and whether the iterator's return domain allows that value (and whether MHD_NO is equal to some value that makes the comparison always true/false).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets a static analyzer determine if any of the 'if' conditions, the for-loops, or the inner return can never be reached due to type/constant definitions (the essence of the MISRA unreachable-code rule)."
