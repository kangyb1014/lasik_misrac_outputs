  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: required to locate the rq member and understand how headers_received is obtained. If header/value lifetime/representation are stored here, that affects string vs binary semantics.\n- connection->rq (type of the 'rq' member): the exact type of rq shows where headers_received is declared and any invariants attached to that request object (e.g. ownership, encoding, termination).\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: the full definition is needed to know the exact types and semantics of the members used by the function (header, header_size, value, value_size, kind, next).\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::header and MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::value: their declared types (e.g. char *, const char *, unsigned char *, void *) determine whether they are null-terminated C-strings or arbitrary byte buffers. The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on null-terminated strings, so knowing these types is essential.\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::header_size and ::value_size: the types and documented meaning (byte count, includes/excludes NUL) determine whether comparisons should use length-aware functions (memcmp) or string functions (strcmp/strncmp). If sizes exist and describe lengths, memcmp may be appropriate; if members are NUL-terminated strings and sizes are not used as exact lengths, memcmp could be misused.\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::kind: presence/bitflags may affect which headers are considered; not directly about memcmp but needed to understand which header/value instances are examined.\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::next: to confirm linked-list traversal semantics (not directly about memcmp but needed to understand data origin).\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: to interpret kind masking and whether particular kinds imply text strings vs binary data (some kinds could indicate that value is binary, which affects whether memcmp is appropriate).\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIteratorN (function-pointer signature): the exact parameter types and intended semantics of the iterator callback (types of key/value parameters and their length parameters) are required to know whether the callback receives null-terminated strings or length-delimited buffers.\n- all implementations/definitions of functions that can be passed as MHD_KeyValueIteratorN callbacks: the target function invokes the callback pointer. Even if this function itself does not call memcmp, a callback implementation may use memcmp incorrectly on the passed header/value. To determine whether the overall use (including this call site) violates the MISRA rule you must inspect possible callback implementations for memcmp-on-NUL-terminated-strings.\n- MHD_NO (constant): to understand the return convention of the callback and the control flow (early return vs full traversal). This helps detect whether a callback that uses memcmp may be invoked at all and how many times; not about memcmp directly but necessary to reason about reachable code paths that could violate the rule.\n\nIn short, to decide whether the code here (or the functions it calls via the iterator) violates \"memcmp shall not be used to compare null-terminated strings\" you must know the exact types and string-vs-binary contract of the header/value fields, the iterator callback signature, and examine implementations of those callbacks for misuse of memcmp. The listed symbols supply that information."
