  "explanation": "struct MHD_Connection: needed to know the types of the parameters inside connection (in particular the rq member and whether headers_received is a pointer field). To prove the function does not assign to the parameter variable 'connection' and to check that reading connection->rq.headers_received is only a read of the object pointed to by the parameter.\n\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: required to see the types of pos->next, pos->kind and the header/value fields. This lets us confirm operations in the loops only read fields of the pointee (allowed) and do not write back into the connection pointer itself.\n\ntypedef MHD_KeyValueIteratorN (function pointer prototype): required to know the exact prototype of the iterator parameter (parameter types and whether iterator_cls is passed by value or by pointer-to-pointer). This determines whether calling iterator(...) could legally modify the iterator parameter (it should not) or only the object pointed to by iterator_cls (which is allowed).\n\nenum MHD_ValueKind: required to confirm the type of 'kind' (bitmask/enum) and that the expression (kind & pos->kind) is a read-only use of the parameter 'kind' (not a modification).\n\nMHD_NO (constant/macro): required to know the type/value compared with the iterator(...) return so we can understand return handling and ensure no hidden side-effect macro alters a parameter.\n\ntypedef/enum for iterator return type (e.g. MHD_Result): to confirm the return type of the iterator function call and that comparing it to MHD_NO does not involve modifying any of the function parameters. This also helps detect if the iterator prototype could pass any of the outer function's parameters by reference indirectly.\n\nIn short: these symbols give the layout and prototypes necessary to determine whether the code assigns to any function parameter variables (forbidden) versus only reading or modifying objects pointed to by pointer parameters (allowed)."
