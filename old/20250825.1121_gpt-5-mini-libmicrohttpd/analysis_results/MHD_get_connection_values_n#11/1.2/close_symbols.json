  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C \"no language extensions\" analysis:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: This macro may expand to compiler-specific storage-class or attribute extensions (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)). To decide if the code uses a language extension you must inspect this macro's definition.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The full structure definition (not just the name) may include compiler-extension annotations on members or use nonstandard types; also you must confirm the type of the rq member and that no extension appears in its declaration.\n\n- type of connection->rq (the struct that defines headers_received): The code dereferences connection->rq.headers_received; the type that declares headers_received may carry extension attributes or nonstandard declarations that would violate MISRA. You need that type to check for extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop iterates over this struct and reads its fields. Its definition may include field attributes, bitfields, or compiler-specific extensions (packed, aligned, attributes). Inspecting it is required to detect extensions.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The code uses this enum in bitwise operations (kind & pos->kind). The enum definition may use compiler-specific enum extensions or nonstandard underlying types \u2014 those must be checked.\n\n- MHD_KeyValueIteratorN (the typedef / function\u2011pointer signature): The iterator is invoked as a function pointer. The typedef may include calling-convention macros or attributes (stdcall, __attribute__, nonstandard varargs). You must see the exact signature and any macros used in it to detect language extensions.\n\n- return/result type used by iterator (the type that defines MHD_NO): The code compares the iterator return value to MHD_NO. MHD_NO may be a macro or an enumerator from a nonstandard type. You need the return type and MHD_NO's definition to check for extensions (e.g., macros expanding to compiler intrinsics).\n\n- MHD_NO: This symbol itself may be a macro that expands to a compiler-specific constant or builtin; inspect its definition to ensure it is not a language extension.\n\n- types of header/header_size/value/value_size (members of MHD_HTTP_Req_Header): These member types (for example size_t, pointers, or custom integer types) could be typedefs that are compiler\u2011specific or use attributes (e.g., packed arrays). To ensure no extensions are used you must see their declarations.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow inspection of any macros, attributes, calling conventions, nonstandard typedefs or other compiler-specific extensions that could cause a MISRA violation under the rule \"Language extensions should not be used.\""
