  "explanation": "Only statements that act as controlling expressions (if/for) can violate Rule 14.3. The listed fragments cover all conditionals and loop controls in the function and should be examined for invariance (e.g. whether 'kind' or list contents could make the condition constant across iterations). Other lines in the function are declarations, assignments, returns, or expressions that are not controlling expressions and therefore do not pertain to Rule 14.3; they do not need to be investigated for this rule."
