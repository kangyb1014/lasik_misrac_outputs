  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in MHD_get_connection_values_n is invariant we must know the runtime variability of the values used in those expressions. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function reads connection and connection->rq.headers_received. The full struct is required to determine whether the headers_received pointer is a compile-time constant, stored in read-only memory, or otherwise invariant across calls.\n\n- type of connection->rq and member headers_received: If rq is a sub-structure whose headers_received member has attributes or types that make it constant (or always NULL/non-NULL), the for-loop controlling expression (pos != NULL) could be invariant; knowing this member's declaration is necessary.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop advances pos via pos->next and tests pos->kind. To determine if the loop condition (NULL != pos) or the inner test (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) can be invariant we need the exact definition of this node type (especially 'next' and 'kind') and whether 'next' can point to a fixed/self-referential node (which could produce an infinite loop) or is volatile/mutable.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The inner conditional uses a bitwise test (kind & pos->kind). To tell if that expression is invariant for a given invocation we need the enumeration values and whether enum instances are treated as bitmasks (and what values 'kind' parameter can take).\n\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIteratorN (prototype and return type): The code calls iterator(iterator_cls, ...). The return type and calling convention are needed to understand the comparison with MHD_NO and whether the call has relevant side effects.\n\n- MHD_NO: The sentinel value compared against the iterator result; its definition is required to decide if that comparison can be true/false invariantly.\n\n- Definitions/annotations of the iterator target functions (side effects): The iterator call occurs inside the loop and may modify the list, pos, or connection state (or may never return). To determine whether the loop controlling expressions are invariant (for example, if the iterator always causes loop termination or never changes pos->next) we must know whether iterator implementations can change the linked list or the values tested by the loop.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyzer determine if tests such as (NULL == connection), (NULL == iterator), (NULL != pos), and (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) are genuinely invariant or depend on mutable state, and whether any invariance is an intended infinite loop (allowed by MISRA) or a violation."
