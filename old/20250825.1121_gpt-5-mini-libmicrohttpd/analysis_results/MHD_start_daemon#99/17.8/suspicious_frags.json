  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any of the function parameters. The function parameters are: flags, port, apc, apc_cls, dh, and dh_cls. None of these are assigned to, used as l-values, incremented/decremented, or have their addresses taken and passed to other functions for modification. The va_start(ap, dh_cls) uses dh_cls only as the last fixed parameter name (per va_start semantics) and does not modify dh_cls. The variadic arguments are accessed via the local va_list ap and passed to MHD_start_daemon_va; that does not involve modifying any of the declared parameters. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
