  "explanation": "1) struct Sha512_256Ctx \u2014 The full struct definition is required to determine the layout of the context object, and to locate the members that the function writes. Without it you cannot determine whether the assignments to H[0]..H[7] are in\u2011bounds or whether the count fields exist.\n\n2) Sha512_256Ctx.H (definition / array size) \u2014 The precise declaration of the H member (type and array length) is the critical symbol for the MISRA string/bounds check: the function writes H[0] through H[7], so the analyzer must know H's declared length to confirm those eight writes do not access beyond the array bounds.\n\n3) Sha512_256Ctx.count (type) \u2014 The code assigns 0 to ctx->count; the exact type (e.g. uint64_t, uint32_t, a bitfield, or a pointer-sized type) is needed to ensure the assignment is valid and does not trigger any hidden storage/overflow/aliasing concerns relevant to bounds analysis.\n\n4) Sha512_256Ctx.count_bits_hi (type) \u2014 Same rationale as for count: the analyzer must know the declared type (and any bitfield width) to confirm the assignment ctx->count_bits_hi = 0 is well defined and does not write out-of-bounds within the struct.\n\n5) UINT64_C (macro) \u2014 The macro expands the integer constants used in the H assignments. Knowing its definition ensures the constants have the intended width/type (e.g. (uint64_t) or suffix ULL) and that the assigned values do not cause unexpected conversions or temporaries that could affect correctness (though not directly a string.h issue, it is part of a sound analysis of these writes).\n\n6) uint64_t (typedef / exact width of integer types used in struct) \u2014 If the struct uses fixed-width integer types (uint64_t or similar), the analyzer must know their exact definitions to reason about sizes and alignment and to verify the H array element size used for bounds-checking.\n\nNotes: The target function contains no calls to the <string.h> functions listed by the MISRA rule. The above symbols are sufficient to determine whether the eight indexed writes and the two zero assignments are within the storage bounds of the ctx object. No other functions or callers in the provided call graph are necessary to decide whether this function itself violates the string.h bounds rule."
