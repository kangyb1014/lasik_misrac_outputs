  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_SHA512_256_init is dead code (i.e., its removal would not affect program behaviour) we must establish both reachability (is the function ever executed) and semantic effect (whether its assignments matter). The listed symbols are needed for that analysis:\n\n- digest_init_one_time: Direct caller of MHD_SHA512_256_init. Required to see when/if MHD_SHA512_256_init is invoked and under what conditions.\n\n- digest_reset: Direct caller of MHD_SHA512_256_init. Needed for the same reachability/condition analysis as above.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest: Caller of digest_init_one_time. Needed to trace call chains from higher-level code into digest_init_one_time \u2192 MHD_SHA512_256_init to determine runtime reachability.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: Another caller of digest_init_one_time; included to cover alternate call paths that might reach MHD_SHA512_256_init.\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner: Caller of both digest_init_one_time and digest_reset. Required to determine whether those init functions are reachable in authentication checks.\n\n- queue_auth_required_response3_inner: Caller of digest_init_one_time. Included to determine whether queue/auth response paths invoke the init.\n\n- calculate_add_nonce_with_retry: Caller of digest_reset. Included to determine whether reset (and therefore the init) is invoked by nonce/calculation code paths.\n\n- MHD_MD5_init and MHD_SHA256_init: Other callees invoked together with MHD_SHA512_256_init inside digest_init_one_time/digest_reset. These are needed to understand whether the group initialization call is functionally required (e.g., if only other inits are used and SHA512_256 is never relied upon), and to inspect any conditional logic that may cause SHA512_256 init to be skipped or made redundant.\n\n- struct Sha512_256Ctx: The type of the ctx parameter. Required to inspect how the initialized members (H[], count, count_bits_hi) are used elsewhere. If no other code ever reads these fields or they are always overwritten later, the assignments here may be dead; conversely, if other code depends on these initial values, removal would change behaviour.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the next analyst (a) follow call chains to determine if MHD_SHA512_256_init can be executed at runtime and (b) inspect uses of the initialized fields to decide whether the assignments performed by MHD_SHA512_256_init have any observable effect (i.e., whether they are truly dead)."
