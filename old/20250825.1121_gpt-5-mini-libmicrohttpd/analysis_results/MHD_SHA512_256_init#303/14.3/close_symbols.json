  "explanation": "- struct Sha512_256Ctx (full definition): needed to know the exact types and qualifiers (e.g. volatile, const, bit\u2011fields, array sizes) of members H[], count and count_bits_hi. Qualifiers or bit\u2011field definitions could introduce hidden semantics or constraints relevant to MISRA checks (for example volatile/const affecting observable behavior), and are required to confirm there are no implicit or macro\u2011driven control constructs inside member access. \n- UINT64_C macro definition: the assignments use UINT64_C(...). The macro expansion must be inspected to ensure it is a simple integer constant literal/cast and does not expand to any control expression (conditional, loop or other invariant controlling construct). \n- uint64_t typedef (or the exact integer typedef used by UINT64_C): to verify the type of H[] elements (and that the literal expressions are compile\u2011time constants of the expected type) and to ensure no surprising semantics that could involve control expressions. \n- Any typedefs/macros used for count and count_bits_hi types: to confirm these members are plain integer types (and not macros or types that expand to expressions with control flow).\nThese symbols allow a complete local analysis of the function body to determine whether any controlling expressions (loops/conditionals) are present or implicitly introduced by macros/types, and thus whether the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions could be violated."
