  "explanation": "MISRA's for-loop rule requires reasoning about the behaviour of any functions executed inside a for-loop body. Although MHD_SHA512_256_init has no for-loop itself, it is called by other functions and may therefore execute inside callers' for-loops. To determine whether a for statement that (directly or transitively) invokes MHD_SHA512_256_init is well-formed you need the following symbols:\n\n- digest_init_one_time: direct caller. You must inspect its code to see whether it is invoked inside a for loop and whether that loop's clauses satisfy MISRA requirements.\n- digest_reset: direct caller. Same rationale as above.\n- MHD_MD5_init, MHD_SHA256_init: these are callees invoked alongside MHD_SHA512_256_init by the two caller functions. If a for loop calls digest_init_one_time or digest_reset, the loop body includes these transitive calls; their side-effects (if any) can affect whether the loop uses only a single loop counter and whether objects modified in the body are used in loop clauses.\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest, MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash, digest_auth_check_all_inner, queue_auth_required_response3_inner, calculate_add_nonce_with_retry: callers of digest_init_one_time/digest_reset from the static call graph. Those functions are the likely calling contexts where MHD_SHA512_256_init might be executed inside a for loop; their source is required to find any for loops, identify loop counters, and check clause properties (which objects are used/modified).\n- struct Sha512_256Ctx (definition including H[], count, count_bits_hi): MHD_SHA512_256_init writes ctx->H[], ctx->count and ctx->count_bits_hi. To decide whether those writes violate MISRA's requirements (e.g., modifying an object that is used as a loop counter or a loop-control flag in the enclosing for loop), you must know the exact types and layout of these fields and whether calling contexts can pass in objects that are used as loop counters/flags.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the direct callers, their callers / calling contexts, the transitive callees, and the context type for ctx) provides the necessary code surface to determine if any for-loop that executes MHD_SHA512_256_init (directly or transitively) violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rules."
