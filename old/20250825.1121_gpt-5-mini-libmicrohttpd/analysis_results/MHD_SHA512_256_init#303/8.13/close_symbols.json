  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for the MISRA rule (pointer should point to const whenever possible):\n\n- struct Sha512_256Ctx (full definition): The function writes to ctx->H[], ctx->count and ctx->count_bits_hi. You must see the struct declaration to confirm the types of these members and whether any members are already const-qualified (which would make the assignments illegal) or are pointer members that might introduce additional const-correctness considerations. This determines whether the parameter could logically be const.\n\n- typedef for Sha512_256Ctx (if present): Some code uses a typedef alias instead of 'struct ...'. The exact symbol name used in function prototypes matters when checking for const qualification in the public API.\n\n- UINT64_C macro (and the header that defines it): While not directly affecting constness, you should confirm what UINT64_C expands to (the underlying integer literal/type) and which headers/type aliases (e.g. uint64_t) are used, to ensure there are no surprising const qualifiers or macro behaviors that affect the assignments.\n\n- uint64_t (underlying fixed-width integer typedef): To verify member types (H array element type) and ensure there are no const-qualified integer typedefs involved; also to validate that the assignments are to modifiable integer objects.\n\n- digest_init_one_time (declaration/definition and its call-sites): This caller passes whatever context object into MHD_SHA512_256_init. Examining it and its call-sites shows whether callers ever pass a const-qualified Sha512_256Ctx (or objects that should be treated as const). If callers hold or propagate const-qualified contexts, that would influence whether the callee's pointer signature should be const (or if there is a const-correctness mismatch).\n\n- digest_reset (declaration/definition and its call-sites): Same reason as digest_init_one_time \u2014 check how the context is created/held/passed by callers to determine if const propagation is possible or if a const-qualified parameter would be incompatible with current usage.\n\nIn short: the struct definition and typedef reveal whether the function actually mutates members (thus preventing a const parameter), the integer typedefs/macros confirm member types, and inspecting the callers shows whether contexts are ever treated as const elsewhere (which could indicate an API-level const-correctness issue)."
