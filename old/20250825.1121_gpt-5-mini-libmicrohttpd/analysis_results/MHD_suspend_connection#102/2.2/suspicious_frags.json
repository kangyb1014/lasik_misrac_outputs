Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Items not listed above were not marked for investigation because they are either preprocessor directives or essential control-flow elements whose removal would clearly change program behaviour. Specifically:\n- The function signature and opening/closing braces are necessary to define the callable unit and cannot be removed without altering the program.\n- The #ifdef/#endif lines themselves are preprocessor directives (not runtime operations); any code they enable/disable is investigated where included in the suspicious list. The directives are not executable dead code.\n- Simple control-flow constructs (the return inside the UPGRADE_SUPPORT block is included in the suspicious fragment list) and the function-level structure are required for correct control transfer; removing them would change behaviour.\n- No other pure data declarations or statements outside those listed appear to be executed no-op operations; the fragments selected above cover assertions, logging/panic calls, the local assignment that may be unused depending on build macros, and the final suspend call \u2014 these are the places most likely to contain executed operations that could be dead and therefore merit investigation."
