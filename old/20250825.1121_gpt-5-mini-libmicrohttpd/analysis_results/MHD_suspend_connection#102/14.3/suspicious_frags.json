  "explanation": "Other conditional/loop controlling expressions in the provided code do not appear to be invariant: - The runtime if statements use structure members (daemon->options, connection->urh) and thus are not compile-time invariant. - The assertion macro mhd_assert(ignore) is defined as ((void)0), so the assertion call in the function is removed by the macro and does not introduce a controlling expression to be checked. - Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS, #ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT, #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) are compile-time configuration switches and are not subject to Rule 14.3 which targets controlling expressions in C language constructs. - MHD_DLOG contains a runtime if that depends on daemon->options and calls a variadic logging function; its controlling expression is not invariant. Therefore these fragments do not require investigation under Rule 14.3."
