  "explanation": "I inspected the function and related definitions for use of compiler language extensions (e.g. GNU/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline asm, label-as-value, __builtin_* intrinsics, asm labels, non-standard storage-class specifiers, or other documented compiler-only language extensions). None of those appear in the provided code.\n\nNotes justifying not flagging any fragments:\n- epoll_* calls and EPOLLIN/EPOLLRDHUP constants are platform-specific system APIs (Linux/POSIX), not C language extensions, so they are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 1.2.\n- Use of stdint-style types (uintptr_t, uint64_t, uint16_t) and bool are standard C (C99/C11) features, not compiler extensions.\n- Use of casts (including pointer\u2194integer via uintptr_t) and the technique in _MHD_DROP_CONST are implementation-defined behaviors in the C standard but are not compiler language extensions; they therefore do not trigger Rule 1.2.\n- Preprocessor macros, conditional compilation (#ifdef / #endif), variadic functions (va_list, va_start/va_end) and backslash line continuations are standard preprocessor/C features, not extensions.\n- I noticed the identifier constvoid in the _MHD_DROP_CONST macro as presented ((constvoid*)(ptr)); this is not a known compiler extension \u2014 it is either a typo in the provided snippet or a user typedef elsewhere. It is not an explicitly documented compiler language extension and therefore is not reported under Rule 1.2.\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in the submitted code that use documented compiler language extensions and need to be reported for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
