  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the snippet alone. MISRA Rule 8.13 requires a pointer type to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. In the provided function pp->content_transfer_encoding is only read (checked for NULL), but that by itself is insufficient to conclude a violation: you must examine all assignments and frees of that struct member across the whole translation unit (and ideally the program).\n\nIn this codebase there are many places that allocate/free and reassign members of the post-processor (for example pp->content_type is freed and reassigned elsewhere in this routine). It is likely that pp->content_transfer_encoding is set/cleared by header-parsing code (e.g. process_multipart_headers or related functions). If that member is assigned, strdup'ed, or freed elsewhere, it cannot be declared const char * without changing other code.\n\nTherefore, unless you can prove that pp->content_transfer_encoding is never written to (no assignments, no frees, never passed to a function that modifies it) in the whole program, the report is not correct. To conclusively determine a violation, inspect the declaration and all writes to that member; only if it is truly read-only should it be changed to const and then the rule would be violated as reported."
