True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code passes pp->boundary into find_boundary. If pp->boundary is declared as char * (or find_boundary's parameter is a non-const char *), but neither the field nor the function actually modify the pointed-at boundary string, then the pointer should be to a const-qualified type. Example violating scenario: struct MHD_PostProcessor has char *boundary; find_boundary signature is int find_boundary(struct MHD_PostProcessor *, char *b, size_t, ...); the boundary data is only read. In that case Rule 8.13 is violated \u2014 pp->boundary (and/or the function parameter) should be declared const char * (and find_boundary updated to take const char *) to express immutability.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "I cannot confirm the claimed MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 violation from the provided snippet alone. Rule 8.13 concerns declarations: a pointer type should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. The report\u2019s scenario (pp->boundary declared as char * and find_boundary taking char *) would indeed violate the spirit of 8.13 if the boundary data is never modified via those pointers \u2014 in that case pp->boundary (and the function parameter) should be declared const char *.\n\nHowever, the posted function does not show the declaration of struct MHD_PostProcessor nor the prototypes of find_boundary, process_value_to_boundary, or other callees that receive pp->boundary. Without those declarations you cannot determine whether a const qualification is possible or required. Furthermore, elsewhere in this function the code manipulates pp->nested_boundary (assigns strdup, frees it), which suggests some boundary-related fields may be mutable and therefore legitimately non-const; but that does not prove whether pp->boundary itself is mutable or not.\n\nConclusion: the agent\u2019s claim is potentially valid in the hypothetical described, but it is not provable from the supplied code. To determine a real MISRA 8.13 violation you must inspect the declarations of the boundary fields in struct MHD_PostProcessor and the parameter types of the called functions. If those are non-const while the data is only read, then they should be changed to const and the report would be correct."
