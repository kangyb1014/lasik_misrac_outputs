  "explanation": "I flagged every direct use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, strstr, strdup, strlen) because these calls must be inspected to ensure their pointer and length arguments cannot lead to accesses beyond object bounds. The two memmove occurrences are listed separately (they are identical calls at different locations) since each needs independent verification that pp->buffer_pos >= ioff and that the computed length does not underflow. The memcpy call must be checked that pp->buffer_pos + max <= pp->buffer_size and poff + max <= post_data_len (and that pp->buffer_size and pp->buffer_pos are valid). The strstr/strdup/strlen sequence must be checked that pp->content_type is non-NULL (it is checked earlier) and that the substring/duplication/strlen operate on a valid NUL-terminated string. Other code fragments were not listed because they do not invoke string.h functions, or their buffer/index accesses are guarded by explicit checks in the code (for example accesses to buf[1] are preceded by (pp->buffer_pos > 1)), or they call project-specific helpers (e.g. MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) which are outside the set of standard <string.h> functions targeted by Rule 21.17 and thus are out of scope for this rule review."
