  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for the MISRA <string.h> bounds rule:\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam\n  - To know the exact layout and types of the param object passed into is_param_equal (including how value, quoted etc. are defined). You must confirm whether value.str is a pointer to a buffer and whether value.len represents the number of valid bytes. Without the struct definition you cannot prove memcmp\u2019s source pointer/length are valid.\n\n- MHD_RqDAuthParam::value (fields: str, len)\n  - Even if the struct is known, explicitly inspect the semantics/type of value.str and value.len (e.g. are they a pointer and length, are they zero-based, is len a byte-count or character-count, can len be larger than allocated capacity). MISRA analysis needs assurance that param->value.str points to at least param->value.len bytes.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The function uses mhd_assert(NULL != param->value.str) and mhd_assert(0 != param->value.len). If mhd_assert is a no-op in production builds (typical assert behavior), those checks cannot be relied upon to guarantee safety. You must inspect its definition to know whether those checks enforce runtime guarantees or are omitted, which affects whether memcmp usage may read out of bounds.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n\n  - Called when param->quoted is true. You must examine its prototype and implementation / contract to know how many bytes it reads from its pointer arguments given the provided lengths (does it read exactly the provided lengths, or could it read additional bytes to scan quotes, NUL-terminate, etc.). If it reads beyond the supplied lengths, that could violate the rule.\n\n- memcmp\n  - memcmp is one of the standard <string.h> functions explicitly covered by the MISRA rule. For the non-quoted branch the code calls memcmp(str, param->value.str, str_len). You must rely on the standard semantics (memcmp reads exactly the n bytes from both pointers). Explicitly including memcmp clarifies that the analysis must ensure both pointer arguments refer to at least str_len bytes \u2014 in particular that param->value.str has at least param->value.len bytes.\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner\n  - This function is the caller that passes the str and str_len arguments into is_param_equal. To prove the values passed into is_param_equal are safe you must inspect the caller\u2019s code to see where str/str_len originate, whether they are validated, and whether they refer to buffers with sufficient length. The caller\u2019s logic may manipulate or derive str_len and buffer ownership/length guarantees.\n\n- MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_\n  - This routine (seen in the static call graph) likely populates the MHD_RqDAuthParam instances (param->value.str and value.len). You must inspect it to know how those buffers are allocated, what their valid lengths are, whether strings are NUL-terminated, and whether value.len is a valid byte count for the buffer.\n\n- get_unquoted_param\n- get_unquoted_param_copy\n- get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z\n  - These helper functions appear in the caller\u2019s call tree and are plausible producers of the str/str_len arguments passed to is_param_equal (they extract or copy parameter strings). You need their implementations or contracts to determine whether the returned pointer/length pairs are always consistent (pointer points to at least length bytes) or whether additional checks are required before memcmp.\n\n- get_buffer_for_size\n  - If the caller requests or allocates buffers via get_buffer_for_size, you must inspect it to confirm buffer sizing semantics and guarantees (returned buffer capacity >= requested length). This affects whether param->value.str and other buffers used with memcmp are sufficiently large.\n\nIn summary: to determine compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule you must (1) inspect the param structure and how value.str/len are produced/allocated, (2) confirm whether mhd_assert provides runtime guarantees or is removed, (3) confirm the exact memory-read behavior of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n for the quoted branch, and (4) inspect the caller(s) that supply str/str_len to ensure those pointers reference at least str_len bytes. The symbols above are the minimal pieces needed to complete that analysis."
