  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                const char *const str,\n                const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function is_param_equal:\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (const char *quoted,\n                            size_t quoted_len,\n                            const char *unquoted,\n                            size_t unquoted_len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n  size_t j;\n  if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n\n  j = 0;\n  for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[i])\n    {\n      i++; /* Advance to the next character */\n      if (quoted_len == i)\n        return false; /* No character after escaping backslash */\n    }\n    if (quoted[i] != unquoted[j])\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n  }\n  if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n    return false; /* The strings have different length */\n\n  return true;\n}\n...\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsize_t i;\n  size_t j;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Two objects i and j are declared and used as loop counters in the for loop (for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires there be only one loop counter and that it not be modified in the loop body. In this code: (a) two counters are used in the for header (violates the single loop counter requirement), and (b) i is also incremented inside the loop body (i++; when handling backslash), which modifies the loop counter in the body. Therefore the for loop is not well-formed per Rule 14.2."
