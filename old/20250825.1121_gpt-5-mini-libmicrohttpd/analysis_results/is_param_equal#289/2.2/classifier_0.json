The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                const char *const str,\n                const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The single mhd_assert call is not provably non\u2011effective from this fragment. If mhd_assert is an active diagnostic that can abort or log when the condition fails, removing it would change behaviour, so it is not dead. However, it would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 in the following scenario: mhd_assert is implemented as a no\u2011op in production builds (e.g. expands to ((void)0)) or the condition is provably always true for all reachable calls (so the assertion has no effect). In that case the executed operation would have no effect on program behaviour and thus would be dead code."
