Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_param_equal:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nis_param_equal (const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param,\n                const char *const str,\n                const size_t str_len)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL != param->value.str);\n  mhd_assert (0 != param->value.len);\n  if (param->quoted)\n    return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (param->value.str, param->value.len,\n                                       str, str_len);\n  return (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn (str_len == param->value.len) &&\n         (0 == memcmp (str, param->value.str, str_len));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The expression uses short-circuit evaluation: memcmp is only evaluated when (str_len == param->value.len) is true, so removing either sub-expression would change behavior. Both parts are meaningful: the length check often avoids an unnecessary memcmp and memcmp performs the actual content comparison. The mhd_assert calls ensure valid pointers/lengths for the memcmp when it is reached. Therefore no executed operation in this fragment is redundant (dead)."
