Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other tokens in the function are structural (braces, whitespace, parentheses) or are the parameter and type declarations already captured as part of the function signature above. There is no other executable statement in this snippet beyond the listed assertions, the conditional branch, and the final return expression. Unreachable-code vs dead-code cannot be determined from this isolated function; therefore the listed fragments cover all statements that could be executed and should be investigated for potential dead-code issues (e.g. assertions compiled out, always-true/false branch, inlining/removal of the static inline function). No other fragments in the provided function require investigation."
