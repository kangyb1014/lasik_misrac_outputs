  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must determine whether the controlling expression if (param->quoted) can be a compile-time or effectively invariant expression. The listed symbols are required as follows:\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam (full definition, including the type of the member `value` and the member `quoted`): essential to know the exact type, qualifiers and attributes of `quoted` (e.g. whether it is a plain int/bool/enum/bit-field, declared volatile, or otherwise constrained). Also needed to know whether `value` members are typed/qualified in a way that affects evaluation. If `quoted` were declared with qualifiers or as a compile-time constant/enum with constant value, the `if` condition could be invariant.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition): assertions can be macros that evaluate expressions or have side-effects in debug builds but disappear in release builds. We must confirm mhd_assert does not alter program state that would affect the value of `param->quoted` (or otherwise change invariance reasoning) and whether its expansion could make the controlling expression effectively invariant in some build configurations.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (declaration/implementation): while this function is called in the branch rather than in the controlling expression, its declaration/definition is needed to ensure it is not a macro or inline construct that could influence compile-time analysis (for example, if it were a macro expanding to an expression referencing `param->quoted` or to something that changes program flow). It also helps the analyzer understand whether the branch body relies on any compile-time constants that might indicate the condition is always the same.\n\n- memcmp (declaration from <string.h>): included because the return expression uses memcmp; although not the controlling expression of the if, full analysis of whether the function contains invariant control behaviour sometimes needs to consider the alternative branch and whether the function as a whole behaves as if the condition is constant. Knowing memcmp's prototype/semantics ensures the return expression is not folded into an invariant by a macro or unusual definition.\n\nThese symbols let an analyzer determine whether `param->quoted` is a runtime-varying member or effectively invariant (compile-time constant, removed/altered by macros, or qualified so as to be unchangeable), and therefore whether the if controlling expression violates the MISRA rule."
