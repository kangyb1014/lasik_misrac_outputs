  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions are present in the given function. The only conditional is if (param->quoted), which depends on the runtime value of param->quoted and is not an invariant. The boolean comparisons (str_len == param->value.len) and the memcmp call are evaluated at runtime and are not constant. The mhd_assert macros could expand to a common do { ... } while (0) pattern; that pattern uses a controlling expression that is a constant false and is explicitly permitted by the rule exceptions (do-while with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false). There are no for/while/do-while loops with invariant conditions in the shown code that would require further investigation."
