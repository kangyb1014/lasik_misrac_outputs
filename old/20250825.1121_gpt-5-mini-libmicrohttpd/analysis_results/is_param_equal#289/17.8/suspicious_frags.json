  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. None of the function parameters are modified in this function: there are no assignments to param, str, or str_len, nor any increments/decrements or reassignments of those parameter variables. The code only reads members of *param (mhd_assert checks and access to param->quoted, param->value.str, param->value.len) and passes those values to other functions. The str parameter is declared as const char *const (both the pointer and the pointed-to object are const here), and str_len is const size_t. The call to memcmp uses const pointers. The mhd_assert calls only evaluate expressions and do not modify parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
