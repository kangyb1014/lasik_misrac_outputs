The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop well-formed' analysis of need_100_continue:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_\n  Reason: Called directly from the target. It may be a macro/inline wrapper or call other functions; if it expands/contains a for loop inlined into need_100_continue that loop must be checked for MISRA compliance. If it is a wrapper that calls other functions, its implementation must be inspected for for-loops and side effects.\n\n- charsequalcaseless\n  Reason: It is the direct callee of MHD_str_equal_caseless_ (per the static call graph) and likely implements character-by-character comparison (commonly using a loop). Its source must be inspected for any for-loops, their loop counters, side effects, and whether they modify objects used in loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n\n  Reason: Called from the target and may iterate over header lists or buffers (typical places for for-loops). Its implementation must be checked for any for-loops and for whether those loops use or modify objects that would affect MISRA loop-counter/side-effect rules when invoked from need_100_continue.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT\n  Reason: Used in an if condition. It may be a macro or inline function; if it expands into code containing a for-loop (rare but possible in some macro families) or has side effects, that affects the for-loop analysis and must be inspected.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_\n  Reason: A macro used as an argument to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n. If it is more than a simple sizeof/constant expression (e.g. a complex macro with side effects or loops), it could affect compliance; verify its expansion is loop-free and side-effect-free.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND and MHD_HTTP_HEADER_EXPECT\n  Reason: These are macro/constant arguments passed into MHD_lookup_connection_value_n. While unlikely to contain loops, their definitions should be inspected to ensure they do not expand into expressions with side effects or loop constructs that would affect MISRA analysis when used in the calling expression.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition of connection->rq, http_ver, remaining_upload_size)\n  Reason: need_100_continue reads fields of connection->rq. If any inlined macros or functions (called directly or within an inlined for-loop) access or modify those fields, the MISRA rule about loop clause objects versus objects modified in the loop body could be affected. Also the types (e.g. integer/boolean types) are needed to judge whether any object could be used as a loop counter or loop-control flag.\n\n- MHD_NO (enum/constant and its type)\n  Reason: Return comparison against MHD_NO is used to decide early exit. Its type and definition should be known to ensure no hidden side effects (e.g. if it is a macro with function-like behavior) and to understand any interactions with called functions' return semantics when reasoning about potential inlined loops.\n\nSummary: The analysis goal is to determine whether any for-loops that are (a) inlined into need_100_continue via macros, or (b) present in functions that are effectively part of the target's control flow due to inlining/expansion, violate MISRA loop-formation rules. The above symbols cover all direct calls and likely inlined macros/constants that could introduce or affect for-loops visible from need_100_continue."
