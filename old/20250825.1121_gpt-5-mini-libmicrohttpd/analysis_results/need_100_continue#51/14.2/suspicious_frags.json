  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loop fragments in the provided code violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The only for statements are the two occurrences in MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next). These meet the rule requirements: the first clause assigns the loop counter (pos), the second clause (NULL != pos) has no persistent side effects and uses only the loop counter, and the third clause (pos = pos->next) modifies only the loop counter and does not use objects that are modified in the loop body. There is only one loop counter (pos) and it is not modified in the loop body. No other for loops appear in the supplied code. Other loops (e.g. the while in MHD_str_equal_caseless_) are outside the scope of Rule 14.2 (which concerns for statements), so they do not need investigation for this rule."
