  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of MHD_get_daemon_info:\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): needed to know which fields are read/written (options, listen_fd, epoll_fd, connections, port, daemon_info_dummy_*). Determining whether assignments or reads are observable (and therefore not dead) requires the concrete layout and lifetime of these members.\n\n- enum MHD_DaemonInfoType and constants: to know which case labels are possible at call sites. If some enum values can never be produced/used by callers, the corresponding case blocks might be dead.\n\n- union MHD_DaemonInfo and daemon_info_dummy_* member types: to determine whether writing into daemon->daemon_info_dummy_* and returning their addresses produces observable behavior (e.g., aliasing, lifetime) or can be removed without effect.\n\n- mhd_assert (definition): mhd_assert calls appear at function start; many assertion macros compile to no-ops in release builds. Knowing its definition is needed to decide whether the assert calls are executed/observable or effectively dead.\n\n- MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_valid_handle_ (definition): used inside asserts; if this has side effects, the assert is not dead. Need to know purity/side effects to judge removal impact.\n\n- MHD_D_IS_THREAD_SAFE_ (macro/function): controls whether MHD_cleanup_connections is called. To decide if the cleanup call (and the branch) is dead we must know when this predicate can be true/false.\n\n- MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY (flag): used in asserts and option checks; its definition/usage affects reachability of assert conditions and some invariants checked there.\n\n- EPOLL_SUPPORT (build macro): controls whether the EPOLL_FD case contains code or compiles to an unconditional NULL return. Build configuration changes whether that case is live.\n\n- MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS and MHD_USE_W32_THREADS (build macros): control compilation of the code that sums worker_pool[i].connections. If not defined that loop is absent; to determine dead code you must know which build options are active.\n\n- worker_pool element type and 'connections' member, and daemon->worker_pool_size: the loop that aggregates per-worker connection counts reads these. To determine whether that loop/assignment is observable (or dead) you must know the structure, whether reads have side effects, and the possible values of worker_pool_size.\n\n- MHD_cleanup_connections (definition): the function called from this function. To decide whether that call is removable (dead), you must know if it has side effects that affect observable program behaviour (resource cleanup, global state changes, etc.).\n\n- MHD_add_connection (definition): one of the known mutators of daemon->connections. To determine whether returning daemon->connections (and associated case) is meaningful, you must know whether other code changes that field.\n\n- MHD_start_daemon and MHD_stop_daemon (definitions): they initialize/modify listen_fd, epoll_fd, port and options. Whether the LISTEN_FD / EPOLL_FD / BIND_PORT cases are meaningful depends on those functions\u2019 behavior.\n\n- close_all_connections (definition): another mutator/cleanup path for connection state; needed to know whether reads of connections are observable.\n\n- callers of MHD_get_daemon_info (main, run_mhd) and their call sites: to determine which info_type values are actually passed in the program, and whether particular case branches are ever executed. Knowing the real call sites is essential to tell if a case block is dead.\n\nIn short: you need the concrete definitions of the daemon type and its dummy info members, the enum values, the build macros that affect conditional compilation, the implementations of predicates/asserts and cleanup/mutator functions that touch daemon state, and the call sites that supply info_type. With those symbols you can reason whether each branch/assignment/return in MHD_get_daemon_info is ever executed and whether its removal would change observable behaviour (the MISRA dead\u2011code criterion)."
