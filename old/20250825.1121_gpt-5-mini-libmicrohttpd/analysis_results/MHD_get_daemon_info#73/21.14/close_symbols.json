  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for MISRA rule (memcmp shall not be used to compare null-terminated strings):\n\n- MHD_cleanup_connections: This is the only direct callee from MHD_get_daemon_info in the provided graph. Any use of memcmp reachable from the target will most likely come from here, so its source is required to see whether memcmp is called and how its arguments are formed.\n\n- cleanup_upgraded_connection: Listed as a callee of MHD_cleanup_connections; it may perform header or protocol string comparisons (e.g. \"Upgrade\", \"Connection\") where memcmp could be misused. Inspecting it is necessary to find memcmp uses on null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_pool_destroy: Called by MHD_cleanup_connections; while less likely to use memcmp on C-strings, it must be checked because it is reachable and could contain such usage.\n\n- MHD_ip_limit_del: Called by MHD_cleanup_connections; this routine likely manipulates IP/address limits and might compare address strings or keys. Its implementation is needed to determine whether memcmp is used on null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_destroy_response: Called by MHD_cleanup_connections; response handling often deals with text buffers and headers. Its source is required to detect any memcmp usage on null-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The actual Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule. You must find all call sites (direct or indirect) to memcmp to inspect how it is used (what pointers and lengths are passed) and determine whether those operands are null-terminated C-strings being compared (a MISRA violation).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): Even though MHD_get_daemon_info itself does not call memcmp, the daemon structure fields (worker_pool, connection lists, response placeholders, etc.) may be passed into callee routines that call memcmp. The structure definition lets you trace which fields are pointers to C-strings vs. binary buffers.\n\n- definition of worker_pool element type (daemon->worker_pool[]): The worker pool element type contains the 'connections' field read in MHD_get_daemon_info and could contain string/buffer members used by cleanup functions. Knowing this type is necessary to understand what data might be passed to memcmp.\n\n- connection object structure(s) used by MHD_cleanup_connections: MHD_cleanup_connections will operate on connection objects; their field types (char * vs. binary buffer + length) determine whether memcmp calls operate on null-terminated strings.\n\n- response object/type definitions used by MHD_destroy_response: If MHD_destroy_response or callers compare response payloads or headers with memcmp, you must know whether those payloads are null-terminated strings.\n\n- IP-limit / address structure(s) used by MHD_ip_limit_del: To determine whether IP/address comparisons using memcmp are operating on null-terminated strings (e.g., textual IPs) vs. binary addresses.\n\nIn short: include the implementations of MHD_cleanup_connections and its reachable callees and the type/structure definitions for any objects those routines manipulate, plus the memcmp symbol itself. Those sources/types let you inspect each memcmp callsite and decide whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (MISRA violation) or binary buffers (allowed)."
