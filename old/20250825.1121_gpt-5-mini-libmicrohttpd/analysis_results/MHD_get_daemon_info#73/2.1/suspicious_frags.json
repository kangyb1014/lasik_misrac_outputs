  "explanation": "Given the provided additional definitions (EPOLL_SUPPORT = 1, MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS = 1), the only compile-time excluded/unreachable fragment inside MHD_get_daemon_info is the #else branch for the EPOLL_SUPPORT conditional. Other parts of the function are either included by the active macros or are runtime-dependent (switch cases selected by info_type, runtime checks such as daemon == NULL, MHD_D_IS_THREAD_SAFE_(daemon), daemon->worker_pool, and the mhd_assert checks). The thread-related block controlled by #if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) is included because MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS is defined, so it is not unreachable. The remaining return statements inside each switch case are normal control flow (they are reached based on info_type at runtime) and the assertion lines are compile-time present but do not themselves constitute unreachable code. Therefore no other fragments were marked as suspicious."
