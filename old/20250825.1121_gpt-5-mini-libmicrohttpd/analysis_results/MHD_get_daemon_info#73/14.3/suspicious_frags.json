  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All controlling expressions in this function are non\u2011invariant at runtime and therefore do not prima facie violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3:\n\n- if (NULL == daemon) \u2014 depends on the caller-supplied parameter daemon.\n- mhd_assert(...) calls \u2014 these are assertions (macros) and not control statements governed by Rule 14.3; their boolean expressions depend on daemon fields and/or function-like macros and are not compile-time constants.\n- switch (info_type) \u2014 depends on the info_type argument passed at runtime.\n- if (! MHD_D_IS_THREAD_SAFE_(daemon)) and else if (daemon->worker_pool) \u2014 both depend on runtime state (daemon and its fields); they are not constant expressions.\n- for (i = 0; i < daemon->worker_pool_size; i++) \u2014 the loop condition depends on i (which is modified in the loop) and on daemon->worker_pool_size; thus it is variant.\n\nPreprocessor conditionals (#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT, #if defined(...)) only affect compilation and are not C controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. The allowed exceptions to Rule 14.3 (infinite loops and the specific do-while constant-false case) are not present in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for potential invariant controlling expressions under Rule 14.3."
