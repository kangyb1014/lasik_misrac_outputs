  "scenario": "The memset invocation writes exactly sizeof(c->rp) bytes starting at the address of the member rp. This does not access beyond the bounds of that member, so (assuming c points to a valid, fully-initialized MHD_Connection object and rp is a complete/non-flexible member type) the call does not violate Rule 21.17. A violation would only occur if c were invalid (NULL or pointing to insufficient storage) or if rp were an incomplete/flexible array where sizeof(c->rp) did not reflect the actual accessible storage."
