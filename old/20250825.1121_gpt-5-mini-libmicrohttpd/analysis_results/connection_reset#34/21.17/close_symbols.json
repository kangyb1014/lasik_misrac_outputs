This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for out-of-bounds use of <string.h> functions:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): connection_reset performs memset(&c->rq, 0, sizeof(c->rq)) and memset(&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp)) and reads/writes many members (read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, pool, rp.response, etc.). To verify that these memset calls are sized/targeted correctly (no write beyond the rq/rp fields) and that subsequent assignments don't rely on overwritten/invalid memory, the complete layout, sizes and member types of MHD_Connection are required.\n\n- definition of the type of c->rq (the request sub-structure): sizeof(c->rq) is used in the memset; you must know the exact type and size of rq and whether it contains subobjects or flexible array members that would make sizeof(...) misleading or unsafe. Also to check that zeroing rq doesn't inadvertently overwrite adjacent data or violate field boundaries.\n\n- definition of the type of c->rp (the response sub-structure): same reasons as rq: sizeof(c->rp) is passed to memset and rp contains members (e.g. response pointer, iov fields) that may interact with other code or require special handling (e.g. deallocation). Need full type to ensure memset only covers the intended object and does not cover dynamic data beyond bounds.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition): connection_reset reads daemon->pool_size and daemon->notify_completed and passes daemon members to other calls. daemon->pool_size is used to compute new_read_buf_size. To ensure MHD_pool_reset is called with correct sizes and that the computed new_read_buf_size cannot cause buffer overflows (memcpy/memmove inside pool reset), daemon layout and types are needed.\n\n- MHD_pool_reset (prototype and implementation): connection_reset calls MHD_pool_reset with (c->pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_offset, new_read_buf_size). To determine whether this call may trigger a string.h function (memcpy/memmove/memset) that could access beyond c->read_buffer bounds, you must inspect MHD_pool_reset implementation: how it copies/preserves existing bytes, whether it uses memcpy/memmove with the provided offsets/sizes, and what assumptions it makes about the buffer and pool arguments.\n\n- MHD_destroy_response (implementation): connection_reset calls MHD_destroy_response(c->rp.response). That function often frees or manipulates response internals and may itself call string.h functions. To see if any string.h usage from destroy_response could read/write beyond objects referenced by pointers passed from connection_reset (for example if connection_reset later memset zeros the rp while destroy_response still expects valid subobjects), you must inspect its implementation.\n\n- MHD_connection_close_ (implementation): When reuse==false connection_reset calls MHD_connection_close_(...), which in turn calls MHD_destroy_response and MHD_pool_destroy and may alter the memory pool/connection state. To determine whether the sequence of calls (close -> destroy/pool_destroy -> then connection_reset continuing to write NULL/0 into c members) could cause string.h functions to operate on already-freed or out-of-scope memory, you must examine the full implementation of MHD_connection_close_.\n\n- MHD_pool_destroy (implementation): MHD_connection_close_ calls MHD_pool_destroy; pool destruction can involve freeing or compacting memory and may use string.h functions internally. To ensure no subsequent memset or pool reset performs string.h on freed or incorrectly sized buffers, inspect MHD_pool_destroy behavior.\n\nIn short: to assess compliance with the MISRA rule you must not only examine the memset calls in connection_reset, but also the exact object layouts (so sizeof is correct) and the implementations of the called pool/response/close routines that may themselves use memcpy/memmove/memset or change buffer lifetimes. The listed symbols provide the types and implementations needed to decide whether any string.h usage could access memory beyond the referenced objects."
