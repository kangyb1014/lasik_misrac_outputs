  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they either directly call a string.h function (memset) or pass buffer pointers and sizes to a helper that may internally perform block memory operations (MHD_pool_reset). No other lines in this function invoke functions from <string.h> (there are only assignments, NULL checks, boolean flags, calls to higher-level API functions listed above, and pointer/size integer arithmetic). Simple pointer assignments and field resets do not themselves use the <string.h> routines and therefore do not fall under Rule 21.17 for this function; they need no further investigation here. The remaining function calls and operations either do not perform raw memory block operations or are outside this translation unit (and so would be inspected in their own definitions if necessary)."
