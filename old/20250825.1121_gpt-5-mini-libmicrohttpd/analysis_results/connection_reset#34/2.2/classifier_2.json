  "scenario": "The assignments after MHD_connection_close_ are not dead. MHD_connection_close_ destroys the memory pool and response and marks the connection closed, but it does not clear the per-connection read/write buffer pointers or their size/offset fields. Removing the subsequent assignments (c->read_buffer = NULL; c->read_buffer_size = 0; etc.) could leave dangling pointers or stale size/offset values and thus change program behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
