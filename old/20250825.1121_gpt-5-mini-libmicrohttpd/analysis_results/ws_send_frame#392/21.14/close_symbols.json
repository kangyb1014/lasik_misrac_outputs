  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (memcmp must not be used to compare null\u2011terminated strings) you must inspect not only ws_send_frame but also any functions and symbols reachable from it and any callers that construct its inputs: \n\n- send_all: callee of ws_send_frame. It could contain a memcmp that compares buffers/strings before sending; any memcmp inside it must be checked to ensure it is not comparing null\u2011terminated strings.\n- make_blocking: callee of send_all (per the static call graph). Inspect it for uses of memcmp (indirect callees may introduce violations).\n- run_usock: caller of ws_send_frame. The caller constructs or passes the msg/length arguments; you need to inspect run_usock to determine whether msg is a null\u2011terminated C string (vs. binary buffer) and whether any memcmp use in the caller/related code causes or depends on such comparisons.\n- memcmp: the standard library function under scrutiny. Grep/scan for uses of this symbol in the target translation unit and in the listed callees/callers to find potential violations.\n- CLIENT_SOCKS, MAX_CLIENTS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: global data used by ws_send_frame in the loop that sends responses. While these are not string APIs, checking their definitions helps ensure there are no hidden wrapper functions/macros that perform string comparisons (e.g., debugging or logging wrappers that might call memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings).\n- MUTEX: the mutex used around the send loop. Inspecting its definition is needed to rule out any side\u2011effecting macros/wrappers that could perform string comparisons when locking/unlocking.\n- WS_FIN, WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: frame construction macros/constants. Inspecting them is required to confirm frame handling is purely binary and that no helper macros expand to routines that compare strings (unlikely but necessary for a complete analysis).\n- SIZEOF_SIZE_T: preprocessor condition controls which frame layout is used; include it to ensure you analyze the exact code path compiled (affects where bytes are taken from 'length' but also which code is active for inspection).\n\nSummary: prioritize inspecting send_all and its callees (make_blocking) and searching all these symbols/translation units for any use of memcmp. Also examine run_usock to know whether msg is a null\u2011terminated string (which would make any memcmp on it a violation)."
