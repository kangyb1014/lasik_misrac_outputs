  "explanation": "I inspected the provided ws_send_frame implementation and the related additional code. There are no calls to the Standard Library function memcmp anywhere in the shown code. The code performs byte-wise copies from msg into response using an index-based loop, uses snprintf, send, recv, malloc/free, and pthread mutex operations \u2014 none of which are memcmp calls or string comparisons implemented via memcmp. The only potential string-like handling is the explicit loop copying msg[i] and the explicit null-termination response[idx_response] = '\\0'; those are not uses of memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). Note: I only reviewed the code provided. If other modules (for example ws_receive_frame or other files) exist but were not supplied, they should be searched for memcmp usages; no memcmp calls were present in the supplied fragments."
