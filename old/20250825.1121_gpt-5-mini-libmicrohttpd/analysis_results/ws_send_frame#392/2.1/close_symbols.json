  "explanation": "For deciding whether any portion of ws_send_frame is statically or effectively unreachable you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- run_usock: ws_send_frame has a single static caller (run_usock) in the call graph. To know what argument values (especially length and sock) are actually passed and whether some branches in ws_send_frame are never exercised, the caller implementation and call sites must be inspected.\n\n- SIZEOF_SIZE_T: This compile-time macro controls which length-encoding branch is compiled (#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4). Whether the 8-byte-length branch exists (and thus whether its code can be reached) depends on this macro.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: The for-loop iteration count depends on MAX_CLIENTS. If MAX_CLIENTS is zero the loop body (and any calls to send_all inside it) is unreachable; different values change reachability of the loop body.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: The loop iterates over CLIENT_SOCKS entries and the per-entry condition uses its contents. If CLIENT_SOCKS is always equal to sock or always equal to MHD_INVALID_SOCKET for every index, the send_all call may be unreachable. You must know how CLIENT_SOCKS is defined/initialized to assess reachability of the loop body and send_all invocations.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: The per-client condition tests against this value. Its definition (and whether CLIENT_SOCKS entries ever differ from it) affects whether the conditional body can be entered.\n\n- MUTEX: The code calls pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX) and aborts on non-zero return. To determine whether the abort() path (and the code after lock) is reachable, you need to examine MUTEX's initialization/usage and any guarantees about pthread_mutex_lock success in this program context.\n\n- send_all: Although send_all is a callee, whether calls to it occur depends on the conditions above; additionally, send_all's behavior (e.g. does it longjmp, never return, or otherwise alter control flow) could make subsequent code unreachable. Inspecting send_all is therefore necessary to conclude reachability of code after its invocations.\n\nThese symbols collectively determine which branches/blocks in ws_send_frame are actually compilable and reachable at runtime, which is required to assess any violation of the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
