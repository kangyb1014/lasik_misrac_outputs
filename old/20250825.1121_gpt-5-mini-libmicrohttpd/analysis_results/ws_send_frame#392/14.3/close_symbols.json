  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for evaluating invariant controlling expressions:\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS\n  Reason: The for-loop for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++) uses MAX_CLIENTS as the loop bound. Its compile-time value (e.g. 0) or change across builds determines whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant (always false or always true).\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS\n  Reason: The inner conditional uses isock = CLIENT_SOCKS[i]; then tests (isock != MHD_INVALID_SOCKET) && (isock != sock). The contents/initialization of CLIENT_SOCKS affect whether that conditional is constant (e.g. all entries equal to MHD_INVALID_SOCKET) at runtime.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET\n  Reason: The comparison against MHD_INVALID_SOCKET is part of the controlling expression in the loop body. Its value and type matter when deciding if the expression can be invariant.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef)\n  Reason: The type of isock/sock affects semantics of comparisons with MHD_INVALID_SOCKET and influences whether comparisons are meaningful constants across platforms (signed/unsigned width etc.).\n\n- MUTEX (pthread_mutex_t)\n  Reason: The if statements check the return of pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX) and pthread_mutex_unlock(&MUTEX). MUTEX state and identity influence whether those calls could be invariant (e.g. if lock/unlock are no-ops) and therefore whether the controlling if expressions are invariant.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  Reason: The function return value is used directly in an if controlling expression (if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX))). To reason about invariance you must know its semantics/implementation (possible constant return) on the target platform.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  Reason: Same as pthread_mutex_lock \u2014 its return is tested in an if and its behavior affects whether the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- WS_FIN\n  Reason: Used to initialize frame[0]; while not directly a controlling expression, the constant may be relevant if static analysis folds expressions or if preprocessor/platform differences change code paths relevant to loop bounds or invariance analysis.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME\n  Reason: Same rationale as WS_FIN \u2014 constants used to build the header can affect compile-time folding or conditional compilation decisions during analysis.\n\n- SIZEOF_SIZE_T\n  Reason: This preprocessor macro controls presence of the large-length branch (the #if SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4 block). Whether that block exists changes which branches/assignments (and therefore which idx_first_rdata values) are possible, affecting the loop bounds (i < idx_first_rdata) and whether those bounds are effectively invariant.\n\nNotes:\n- send_all is already present in the call graph and so was not repeated here.  \n- Standard library functions (malloc, free, abort) are not primary to deciding whether controlling expressions are invariant, so they were omitted; include them only if the analysis needs platform-specific behavior of allocation/termination.\n\nProvide these symbols so the next agent can determine concrete values/definitions (macro values, array contents, typedefs, and function semantics) and thus decide whether any controlling expression in ws_send_frame is invariant and violates the MISRA rule."
