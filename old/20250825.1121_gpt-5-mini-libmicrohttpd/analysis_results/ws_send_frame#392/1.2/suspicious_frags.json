  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, asm(), or designators that are non-standard.  \n- The use of ssize_t as a type and functions such as pthread_mutex_lock, send, fcntl, ioctlsocket, malloc, free and abort are POSIX/OS APIs or standard library calls, not language compiler extensions documented as extensions to the C language by compilers. These are platform or library APIs and should be handled as portability/OS-dependency issues, not MISRA Rule 1.2 language-extension violations.  \n- Conditional compilation (#if/#elif/#else) and the platform-specific branches for Windows vs POSIX are standard preprocessor usage, not language extensions.  \n- All casts in the code are standard C casts; array declarations and pointer usage are standard C.  \n- The code does not use inline assembler, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, non-standard keywords, or other constructs that compilers typically document as language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) in the supplied snippets."
