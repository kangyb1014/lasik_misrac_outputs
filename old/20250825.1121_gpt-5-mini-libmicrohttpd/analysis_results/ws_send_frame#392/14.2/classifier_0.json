  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ws_send_frame:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nws_send_frame (MHD_socket sock, const char *msg, size_t length)\n{\n  unsigned char *response;\n  unsigned char frame[10];\n  unsigned char idx_first_rdata;\n  size_t idx_response;\n  size_t output;\n  MHD_socket isock;\n  size_t i;\n\n  frame[0] = (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME);\n  if (length <= 125)\n  {\n    frame[1] = length & 0x7F;\n    idx_first_rdata = 2;\n  }\n#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4\n  else if (0xFFFF < length)\n  {\n    frame[1] = 127;\n    frame[2] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 56) & 0xFF);\n    frame[3] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 48) & 0xFF);\n    frame[4] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 40) & 0xFF);\n    frame[5] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 32) & 0xFF);\n    frame[6] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 24) & 0xFF);\n    frame[7] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 16) & 0xFF);\n    frame[8] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 8) & 0xFF);\n    frame[9] = (unsigned char) (length & 0xFF);\n    idx_first_rdata = 10;\n  }\n#endif /* SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4 */\n  else\n  {\n    frame[1] = 126;\n    frame[2] = (length >> 8) & 0xFF;\n    frame[3] = length & 0xFF;\n    idx_first_rdata = 4;\n  }\n  idx_response = 0;\n  response = malloc (idx_first_rdata + length + 1);\n  if (NULL == response)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < idx_first_rdata; i++)\n  {\n    response[i] = frame[i];\n    idx_response++;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < length; i++)\n  {\n    response[idx_response] = (unsigned char) msg[i];\n    idx_response++;\n  }\n  response[idx_response] = '\\0';\n  output = 0;\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    isock = CLIENT_SOCKS[i];\n    if ((isock != MHD_INVALID_SOCKET) && (isock != sock))\n    {\n      output += send_all (isock, response, idx_response);\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (response);\n  return (ssize_t) output;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function ws_send_frame:\nstatic size_t\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], len - off, 0);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], (int) (len - off), 0);\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return off;\n}\n...\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n...\nstatic MHD_socket CLIENT_SOCKS[MAX_CLIENTS]\n...\n#define MAX_CLIENTS 10\n...\n#define MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (-1)\n...\nstatic pthread_mutex_t MUTEX = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER\n...\n#define SIZEOF_SIZE_T 8\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], len - off, 0);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], (int) (len - off), 0);\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The for loop 'for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)' violates Rule 14.2 because the third clause uses the variable 'ret', which is assigned/modified in the loop body (ret = send(\u2026); ret = 0; etc.). Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the loop body. The first clause (off = 0) and second clause (off < len) are compliant, but the use of 'ret' in the third clause makes the loop not well\u2011formed."
