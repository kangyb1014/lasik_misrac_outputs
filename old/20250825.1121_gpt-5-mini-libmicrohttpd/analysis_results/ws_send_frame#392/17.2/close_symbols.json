  "explanation": "To determine whether ws_send_frame participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect all functions on any call-paths to or from it: \n\n- send_all: ws_send_frame directly calls send_all. You must examine send_all to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls ws_send_frame or any function that leads back to ws_send_frame.\n- make_blocking: The static graph shows send_all (and run_usock) call make_blocking. make_blocking must be checked for calls that could reach run_usock or ws_send_frame, closing a recursion cycle.\n- run_usock: run_usock is listed as a caller of ws_send_frame and also calls send_all. If there is a path ws_send_frame -> send_all/... -> run_usock, then run_usock -> ws_send_frame forms indirect recursion. run_usock must be inspected to confirm or rule this out.\n- ws_receive_frame: run_usock calls ws_receive_frame; ws_receive_frame could call send_all or ws_send_frame (or other functions) and thus contribute to an indirect recursion path \u2014 it must be checked.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: likewise called by run_usock and could call into send_all, run_usock, or ws_send_frame; it must be inspected for paths that close a recursion cycle.\n\nIn short, include each function directly called by ws_send_frame and every function that could appear on a path back to ws_send_frame (its callers and their callees) so the full call graph can be inspected for cycles."
