  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code. Therefore there are no direct string.h calls that could cause out-of-bounds accesses under that rule.\n\nAdditionally, the relevant buffer/index math in ws_send_frame appears to allocate and index buffers in a way that prevents out-of-bounds accesses:\n- The local array frame[10] is only accessed at indices 0..9 (the code writes frame[0], frame[1], and in the 64-bit-size_t branch frame[2]..frame[9]; in the other branch it writes frame[2], frame[3]). These indices are within the 10-byte array.\n- response is allocated with malloc(idx_first_rdata + length + 1). The code then writes exactly idx_first_rdata bytes from frame and length bytes from msg, incrementing idx_response accordingly, and finally writes a trailing '\\0' at response[idx_response]. The allocation includes the extra +1 byte for that terminator, so those writes are within the allocated buffer.\n- send_all iterates using off < len and passes &buf[off] with the remaining length (len - off) to send; it advances off by the number of bytes actually sent (ret). That logic does not call any string.h functions and does not perform pointer arithmetic beyond the bounds determined by len.\n\nOther related operations (snprintf usage to compute buffer size, recv into a local buf[2048]) do not invoke string.h functions either. The only function that could possibly manipulate string memory in the provided excerpts is ws_receive_frame, but its implementation was not provided; it would need to be reviewed separately if it uses string.h functions.\n\nGiven the absence of string.h calls in the shown code, there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
