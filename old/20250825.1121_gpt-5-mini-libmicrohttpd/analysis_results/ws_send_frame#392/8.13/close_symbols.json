  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d we need the following symbols and why:\n\n- send_all (prototype/definition): Crucial \u2014 ws_send_frame passes the local buffer response to send_all. To determine whether the buffer parameter of send_all could/should be declared const (i.e. const unsigned char * or const void *), we must know send_all's parameter types and whether its implementation modifies the buffer. The prototype alone (showing const or not) often decides whether ws_send_frame or send_all violates the rule; the definition shows actual modification.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef / declaration): send_all and ws_send_frame use this type. Knowing whether MHD_socket is an integer type, pointer type, or typedef to a pointer is necessary to judge any pointer const-qualification implications in calls/assignments involving sockets.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS (declaration / type of the array): The code indexes CLIENT_SOCKS and assigns its elements to isock. The declaration confirms the element type (e.g. MHD_socket CLIENT_SOCKS[] or MHD_socket *CLIENT_SOCKS) and whether any pointer-to-socket usages could be subject to const qualification rules.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (macro / constant): Needed to understand the comparison used when filtering sockets; it helps confirm the types involved in these comparisons (pointer vs integer) so pointer constness checks are correct.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS (macro / constant): Provides the loop bound and corroborates the CLIENT_SOCKS declaration (array size) \u2014 useful context to ensure no hidden pointer arithmetic or differing declarations that would affect pointer constness.\n\n- MUTEX (declaration and type): The code passes &MUTEX to pthread_mutex_lock/unlock. Knowing MUTEX's type (usually pthread_mutex_t) confirms whether those uses involve pointers and if const-qualification would be relevant for the mutex object or its address.\n\n- malloc and free (prototypes / headers): malloc returns void* which is assigned to unsigned char *response; verifying the standard prototypes confirms whether any const-related casts or mismatches exist and helps determine if response could have been declared const when used (it cannot here because code writes into it before sending).\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock (prototypes): Including their prototypes confirms whether their parameter types are non-const pointers (they are), which helps ensure no misinterpretation about whether &MUTEX should be const.\n\nIn short, the single most important symbol is send_all (its prototype/definition) because it determines whether the buffer parameter should be const; the other symbols provide type context (MHD_socket, CLIENT_SOCKS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, MAX_CLIENTS) and confirm that other pointer uses (response, MUTEX) are correctly mutable or immutable for the MISRA rule analysis."
