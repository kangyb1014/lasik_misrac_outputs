  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The function parameter msg is already declared as const char * and therefore conforms. - The local array frame[] is written to in this function, so it cannot be const-qualified. - The loop index and size_t variables are not pointer types. - The MUTEX is passed by address to pthread_mutex_lock/unlock and represents a mutable synchronization object (cannot be const). - CLIENT_SOCKS and isock are socket handles, not pointers to data that could be const-qualified in this context. The listed fragments cover all uses of a non-const pointer to a byte buffer (response): its declaration, allocation, writes into it, its passing to send_all, and its deallocation \u2014 these are the places that should be inspected to determine whether the pointer type could or should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (for example, whether send_all should take a pointer-to-const). No other pointer declarations/usages in the provided code are candidates for const-qualification."
