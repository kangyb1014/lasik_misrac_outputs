If in the build configuration mhd_assert is enabled and the condition is always true at run-time, then the check is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 this constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. Whether the mhd_assert call constitutes \u201cdead code\u201d per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 depends on build and semantics, and Agent A\u2019s claim is speculative rather than a demonstrated violation of the project as a whole. Points: \n\n- Rule 2.2 prohibits code that is executed yet whose removal would not affect program behaviour. To show a violation you must demonstrate that the assertion\u2019s execution can never affect program behaviour in the project (for all builds and run\u2011time scenarios). Agent A only gives a conditional scenario (\u201cif mhd_assert is enabled and the condition is always true at run time\u201d), not a proof that the condition is always true in the project. Without that proof, you cannot conclude the code is dead.\n\n- The assertion may have observable effects on failure (logging, termination, diagnostics); in that common case its presence changes behaviour and thus is not dead code. Agent A acknowledged this but used the \u2018\u2018always true\u2019\u2019 hypothetical.\n\n- Even if the condition is always true in normal operation, removing the assertion could still change observable behaviour (e.g. timing, diagnostic side effects), which the MISRA note explicitly calls out. That means removal might affect system behaviour, again preventing it from being classified as dead code.\n\n- Finally, whether mhd_assert is compiled out or not is a build configuration detail. If it is compiled out the assertion is not executed and not relevant to Rule 2.2 in the executed code path; if it is compiled in and provably has no effect in the entire project, then (and only then) it would be dead code.\n\nTherefore the agent\u2019s claim does not establish a definite MISRA 2.2 violation for the provided function."
