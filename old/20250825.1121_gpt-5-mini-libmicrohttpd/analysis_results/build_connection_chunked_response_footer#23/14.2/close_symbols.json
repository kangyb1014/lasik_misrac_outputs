There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "To determine whether the for loop 'for (pos = c->rp.response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)' is MISRA-well-formed we must know exactly what the loop counter is, what objects appear in the three clauses, and whether any object used there can be modified by the loop body (including by calls from the body). The listed symbols are required for that reasoning:\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: defines the type of 'pos'. We need its members (kind, header, header_size, value, value_size, next) to check that the third clause (pos = pos->next) modifies only the loop counter and that the body does not modify pos or pos->next. Also we must confirm whether any members are volatile or otherwise have side effects.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: gives the type of 'c' so we can trace c->rp.response and verify that the initialization expression in the first clause (c->rp.response->first_header) is solely establishing the loop counter and not referencing additional objects that the loop body modifies.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (type of c->rp.response): defines the member first_header used in the first clause. We must confirm that first_header is simply a pointer to MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (no hidden side effects) and is not an object that the loop body modifies.\n\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND: the constant compared against pos->kind in the loop body; need its definition to rule out any macro shenanigans (e.g. if it were defined in a way that could expand into code that modifies pos).\n\n- memcpy (prototype / semantics from <string.h>): memcpy is called inside the loop body. MISRA requires considering effects of functions called from the loop body; we need the standard semantics (reads source, writes destination) to verify it does not modify the loop counter 'pos' or pos->next or any object used in the loop clauses.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro / function): it is called inside the loop body. We must know whether this macro/function has side effects (could it modify pos or other objects used in the loop clauses?). If it expands to nothing or an expression without side effects, it is safe; if it can call user code, it might break the rule.\n\n- types of header_size and value_size (e.g. size_t): these member types are used in arithmetic inside the body to compute new_used_size and update used_size. We need to confirm these are plain integer types and that updates to used_size do not constitute modification of any object used in the loop clauses.\n\nWith those symbols/definitions available the analyst can confirm: (a) the loop counter is 'pos' and is initialized only in the first clause, (b) the second clause uses only 'pos' (NULL != pos) and not any other object that the body modifies, and (c) the third clause modifies only the loop counter (pos = pos->next). In particular, the definitions above let us check that none of the called functions (memcpy, mhd_assert) or body statements write to pos or pos->next or to any other object referenced by the for-clause expressions."
