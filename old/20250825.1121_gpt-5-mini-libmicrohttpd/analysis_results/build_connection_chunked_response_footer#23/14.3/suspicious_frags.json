  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions (loop/if/switch/do-while conditions). The listed fragments are all control statements in the function and should be investigated for invariance. Other code in the function (mhd_assert(...) calls, assignments, return statements, memcpy calls, buffer arithmetic, and variable declarations) are not controlling expressions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 14.3; there are no do-while or while(1) infinite-loop constructs or switch statements in this function that would require additional examination under the rule's exceptions."
