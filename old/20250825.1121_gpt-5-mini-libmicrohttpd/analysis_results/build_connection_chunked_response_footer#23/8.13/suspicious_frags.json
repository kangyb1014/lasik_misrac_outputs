  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are used for mutation/writing or are pointer-to-object that is modified: the function writes into buf (char *buf and c->write_buffer), updates c->write_buffer_append_offset and reads/writes members of the connection object, so those pointers cannot reasonably be const-qualified. The function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' and its local alias 'struct MHD_Connection *const c' are used to perform non-const operations (e.g. maximize buffer, update append offset), so they are not candidates for being pointers to const. Similarly, used_size and buf are used as destinations for writes. Therefore they were not reported."
