  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. The function parameter is the pointer 'connection'. The code does not reassign or otherwise modify the parameter variable itself (no statements like 'connection = ...', 'connection++', or pointer arithmetic on 'connection'). A const alias is created (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;) and thereafter all accesses mutate the object pointed to (e.g., c->write_buffer_append_offset += used_size), which is permitted by the rule. Dereferences and passing the pointer to other functions are reads or allowed modifications of the pointed-to object, not modifications of the parameter pointer itself. Therefore there are no violations to report."
