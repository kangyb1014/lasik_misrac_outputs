If used_size is large (e.g. near SIZE_MAX) the expression used_size + 2 can wrap, making the condition (used_size + 2 > buf_size) evaluate false and allowing the subsequent writes buf[used_size++] = '\\r'; buf[used_size++] = '\\n'; to write past the end of the buffer. The same omission exists for new_used_size = used_size + pos->header_size + pos->value_size + 4 prior to memcpy: an overflow there can make the > buf_size test pass incorrectly and lead to out-of-bounds memcpy. This can result in accesses beyond the bounds of objects passed to string.h functions -> Rule 21.17 violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function build_connection_chunked_response_footer:\nstruct MHD_Connection\n{\n\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextE;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevE;\n#endif\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   * This DLL can be either the\n   * 'manual_timeout_head/manual_timeout_tail' or the\n   * 'normal_timeout_head/normal_timeout_tail', depending on whether a\n   * custom timeout is set for the connection.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextX;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevX;\n\n  /**\n   * Reference to the MHD_Daemon struct.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  /**\n   * Request-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Request rq;\n\n  /**\n   * Reply-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Reply rp;\n\n  /**\n   * The memory pool is created whenever we first read from the TCP\n   * stream and destroyed at the end of each request (and re-created\n   * for the next request).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The function performs unchecked size_t arithmetic before testing available space, so additions can wrap and make the bounds checks ineffective. Specifically:\n\n- new_used_size = used_size + pos->header_size + pos->value_size + 4 can overflow. If it wraps to a small value, the subsequent if (new_used_size > buf_size) test can succeed incorrectly and the memcpy calls can write past the end of buf (violating accesses for memcpy). memcpy is one of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n\n- The final check if (used_size + 2 > buf_size) has the same problem: used_size + 2 can wrap, allowing the two byte writes buf[used_size++] = '\\r'; buf[used_size++] = '\\n'; to overrun the buffer.\n\nMISRA Rule 21.17 requires that use of memcpy/etc. must not result in accesses beyond the referenced object bounds. Because integer overflow can make the space-checks unreliable, the code can lead to out-of-bounds accesses and therefore violates the rule. The correct remedy is to perform overflow-safe checks (for example compute remaining = buf_size - used_size and ensure each pos->header_size, pos->value_size and the fixed extra bytes fit into remaining before calling memcpy or writing bytes), or explicitly test for addition overflow (e.g. check each addend against SIZE_MAX - partial_sum) before doing the additions."
