  "explanation": "For a focused MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis of build_connection_chunked_response_footer you must know the exact memory/layout contracts and invariants that govern each pointer/length used in the memcpy calls and the derived buffer arithmetic. Explanation for each symbol: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The function reads and writes multiple fields of this struct: write_buffer, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_size, state and rp. You need the precise types and semantics (sizes, signedness) and any invariants documented in the struct (e.g. whether write_buffer is NULL, relationship between write_buffer_size and append_offset) to determine whether buf = write_buffer + append_offset and subsequent writes can legally address buf[0..buf_size-1].\n\n- connection_maximize_write_buffer\n  - This function returns buf_size used to limit all subsequent writes into buf. You must know its contract: what value it returns (available contiguous space after write_buffer_append_offset or total buffer size?), whether it allocates/expands write_buffer, whether it updates write_buffer_size or write_buffer_append_offset, and whether it can return a value larger than the actual remaining bytes in the underlying buffer. If its contract guarantees buf_size <= (write_buffer_size - write_buffer_append_offset) and ensures write_buffer is non-NULL, the memcpy size checks can be validated.\n\n- type of c->rp (the rp member in MHD_Connection: props and response)\n  - The function checks c->rp.props.chunked and uses c->rp.response. You need the rp member/type definition to know the exact type of response pointer and the semantics of props.chunked (e.g. whether it is a boolean, how set). This also helps verify the asserted preconditions and whether rp.response can be NULL.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (type of c->rp.response; must expose first_header)\n  - The code iterates c->rp.response->first_header. You need the response type to know that first_header exists and the lifetime/ownership rules of its headers so you can reason whether each header's header/value pointers and sizes are valid for memcpy.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n  - The memcpy sizes come directly from pos->header_size and pos->value_size, and the source pointers are pos->header and pos->value. You need the exact layout and documented invariants of this struct (are header_size/value_size the number of bytes available at the pointer? do they include or exclude terminating NUL? are pointers allowed to be NULL when size is zero?) to determine whether copying pos->header_size / pos->value_size bytes is safe.\n\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND\n  - The code only copies headers when pos->kind == MHD_FOOTER_KIND. You must ensure that this kind implies valid header/value pointers and sizes appropriate for use as footers; otherwise headers filtered by kind could still have invalid sizes/pointers causing out-of-bounds memcpy.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CHUNKED_BODY_SENT\n  - Used in an assertion to check state. You need to know whether the program can reach this function in other states and whether the assertion can be compiled out; this affects whether the safety assumptions enforced by the assert can be relied upon in production (MISRA analysis must assume asserts may be disabled).\n\n- memcpy\n  - The rule explicitly targets uses of memcpy (and other <string.h> functions). Include the standard semantics (it copies the exact number of bytes specified from source to destination, with undefined behavior if source or destination ranges are out-of-bounds) so the analyzer can apply that semantic to the calls in this function.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The code uses mhd_assert to check preconditions. You need its definition/behavior (is it a no-op in release builds?) to know whether the asserts provide guaranteed runtime protection or are purely debug checks; MISRA requires reasoning about possible out-of-bounds when such checks are not present.\n\nIn short, to decide if the two memcpy calls can access beyond their source or destination buffers you must know: the exact available destination region (how connection_maximize_write_buffer relates to write_buffer_size/append_offset and whether write_buffer is non-NULL), and the source pointer/length invariants for pos->header/pos->header_size and pos->value/pos->value_size (from struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header and response/header ownership). The symbols above provide the minimal set needed to prove or disprove compliance with the MISRA rule for these memcpy uses."
