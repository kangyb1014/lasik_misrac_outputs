  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to decide if this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp for null-terminated strings:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: needed to know the types of pool->memory, pool->pos, pool->end and pool->size. If pool->memory is a char* or the code treats it as a string, comparisons inside helper macros/functions could be string comparisons; type information is essential to determine whether any memcmp use would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_: used to compute block_offset from block and pool->memory. We must inspect its implementation to confirm it performs pointer arithmetic only (safe) and does not call memcmp internally.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_: used in assertions for pointer ordering. Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not call memcmp or otherwise compare C strings.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: macro/function used for alignment arithmetic. Its expansion could contain helper calls; must verify it does not use memcmp on memory that could be string data.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: same reason as ROUND_TO_ALIGN; included because it is used to compute boundaries and might hide helpers that do memory comparisons.\n\n- mhd_assert: assertions are used repeatedly. The assert implementation (or macro) might invoke diagnostic code that compares memory (unlikely but must be checked). Also assert expansions could reference helper functions that in turn might call memcmp.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: called after memset. Its implementation could use sanitizer or comparison routines; must be inspected for any use of memcmp on possibly null-terminated memory.\n\n- memset: standard library function used here (zeroing). While memset itself is not memcmp, we include it to ensure no wrapper or macro redefines it to use memcmp (very unlikely but necessary for completeness).\n\n- memcmp: the symbol we are checking for. We must search the target function and all referenced symbols/implementations above to see if memcmp is invoked and, if so, whether it is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- __asan_region_is_poisoned and __asan_address_is_poisoned: these ASAN helpers are conditionally used to decide red-zone poisoning. Their implementations must be checked to ensure they do not internally call memcmp on memory that might be NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE: conditional macro that enables ASAN-related code paths. We need its definition/value to determine whether the ASAN branches (which reference the ASAN helpers and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) are active and thus whether memcmp could be used in those paths.\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: conditional macro that alters control flow (early return on zero-size). Its setting affects which code paths are compiled and therefore which helpers must be inspected for memcmp uses.\n\n- _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE: used with the ASAN/red-zone logic and ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE; needed to understand red-zone calculations and whether any helper that uses these constants performs string comparisons.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/implementations of these symbols to determine whether any of them (or their expansions) call memcmp and, if so, whether that memcmp use could compare NUL-terminated strings. If none of these symbols/implementations use memcmp (or any memcmp usage does not compare null-terminated strings), then MHD_pool_deallocate does not violate the MISRA rule."
