  "explanation": "I flagged compile-time conditional blocks and a few condition/assert combinations that can make code paths absent or impossible depending on macros. Specifically:\n- The #if !defined(MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) && !defined(MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE) else-return construct is included or excluded at compile time; its presence/absence changes reachability of the subsequent code paths for block_size == 0.\n- The large MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE block (and its inner HAVE___ASAN_* branches) is controlled by compile-time defines; parts of it will be wholly absent or present, which can make branches unreachable. I included both the ASAN block and the inner HAVE___ASAN_* alternatives for investigation.\n- The _MHD_POISON_MEMORY call with a trailing backslash and the surrounding branch are part of the ASAN handling and should be checked for being compiled in/out and for zero-length poisoning when _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE is 0.\n- The assertion mhd_assert ((block_offset != pool->pos) || (block_size == 0)) combined with the runtime check for block_size != 0 may make certain conditions impossible; that interaction should be reviewed.\n- The \"allocated from the end\" else-branch contains an if (block_offset == pool->end) path whose reachability depends on runtime state but also on earlier assertions/conditions; it is included because its last-block handling mirrors the front-allocated case and may be affected by compile-time options.\n\nOther fragments of the function were not flagged because they are general runtime-controlled logic (checks against pool->pos, pool->end, block offsets, memset/_MHD_POISON_MEMORY for non-zero sizes) and are not statically excluded by the provided macro definitions. With only the supplied additional definitions (notably _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE == 0), there is no definitive evidence that those runtime-dependent branches are always unreachable; they depend on values computed at runtime or on external compile-time defines not provided here. Therefore they do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 based on the information given."
