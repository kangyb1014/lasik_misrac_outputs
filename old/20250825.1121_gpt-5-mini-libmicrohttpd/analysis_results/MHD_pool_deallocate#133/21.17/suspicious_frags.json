  "explanation": "Only the calls that directly (or via obvious macros) manipulate or probe memory regions need inspection for potential out-of-bounds accesses by <string.h> functions. The rest of the function contains assertions, pointer arithmetic, alignment computations, and control flow that do not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by the rule. Specifically:\n\n- All other expressions are mhd_assert checks, arithmetic (ROUND_TO_ALIGN*, additions/subtractions), comparisons, or assignments; none invoke memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn. These do not need investigation for this rule.\n\n- The mp_ptr_diff_ and mp_ptr_le_ helpers and the ROUND_TO_ALIGN/ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE macros perform pointer/size computations and alignment rounding; their use is relevant to proving bounds but they are not string.h calls themselves.\n\n- The conditional logic (checks of block != NULL, block_size == 0, block_offset <= pool->pos, alg_end == pool->pos, etc.) and the mhd_assert constraints limit when the memory-manipulating calls occur; these guards should be considered when investigating the flagged fragments, but the guards themselves do not require separate investigation under Rule 21.17 because they do not call the specified <string.h> functions.\n\nTherefore only the listed memory-manipulating calls (memset, the _MHD_POISON_MEMORY invocations, and the ASan probe calls) are suspicious for potential out-of-bounds accesses and should be examined in detail."
