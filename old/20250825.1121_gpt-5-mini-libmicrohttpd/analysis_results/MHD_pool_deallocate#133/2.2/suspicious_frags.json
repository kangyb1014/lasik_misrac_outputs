  "explanation": "The parts not listed above were not flagged because they perform observable runtime work or determine control flow and so cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. In particular: the if (NULL != block) test and its two main branches are runtime-dependent and lead to modifications of pool state (pool->pos, pool->end) which are observable; the memset(block, 0, block_size) writes memory and thus affects behaviour; the calculations and comparisons using ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, mp_ptr_diff_ and pointer comparisons influence branching and pool offsets and are therefore live; assignments to pool->pos and pool->end are state-changing. Conditional compilation blocks and macros in the source can enable or disable some code in other builds (so presence in source is intentional and not automatically dead). Therefore only code fragments that are effectively no-ops or are entirely under optional ASAN/poisoning macros (and so have no effect given the provided macro definitions) are included above for further investigation."
