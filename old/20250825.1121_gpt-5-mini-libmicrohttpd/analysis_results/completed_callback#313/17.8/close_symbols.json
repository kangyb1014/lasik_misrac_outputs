  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide whether any function parameter is being modified (MISRA rule: a function parameter shall not be modified; the object pointed-to may be modified):\n\n- struct timeval: the code reads fields tv->tv_sec and tv->tv_usec and declares local tve of this type. You must know the fields and their types to confirm accesses are to the object referenced by *req_cls, not to the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- uint64_t (typedef): the arithmetic assigns to local variable delta of this type. Knowing the integer type ensures that the operations do not implicitly write back into any parameter (confirms delta is a local variable).\n\n- SMALL (macro or constant): used in the comparison if (delta < SMALL). Knowing SMALL is required to see whether that expression could expand to something that writes to a parameter (e.g., an unlikely macro with side effects) \u2014 to rule out hidden modifications of parameters.\n\n- small_deltas (array or object): the code indexes small_deltas[delta]++ which writes to a global object. You must inspect its declaration to ensure that the expression does not alias any of the function parameters (i.e., that small_deltas is not a macro that modifies a parameter or aliases req_cls, cls, etc.).\n\n- gettimeofday (function prototype): called with &tve. Knowing its signature and behaviour confirms it writes only into the local tve object and does not modify any function parameter; ensures no indirect modification of a parameter through a macro or unusual prototype.\n\n- free (function prototype): called with tv (a local pointer set to *req_cls). You must know free's semantics (or whether free is a macro) to ensure this call does not modify the pointer parameter variable req_cls or the parameter itself. Also confirms that freeing the pointed object is an allowed modification of the object, not of the pointer parameter.\n\n- fprintf (function prototype): called to print delta. Ensure the fprintf macro/function does not expand into code that modifies parameters (to rule out hidden side effects).\n\n- stdout (object): passed to fprintf. Inspecting its declaration helps rule out macros that might alias or modify function parameters.\n\n- PRIu64 (macro from inttypes.h): used in the format string. Confirm it is a simple format macro (no side effects) so it cannot modify parameters.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (type): included to show that the parameter 'connection' is a pointer to this type. Inspecting its definition is necessary to confirm that any (implicit) operations on that parameter (none present here) are not hidden by macros or inline functions, and to confirm the parameter is not modified in code paths via macros or inlined helpers.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode (type): similarly needed to confirm the 'toe' parameter is not modified by macros or inline expansions and that the (void) toe; statement does not hide writes.\n\nIn short: include the definitions/prototypes/macros for these symbols to verify there are no hidden writes or macro expansions that modify the parameter variables (cls, connection, req_cls, toe). The goal is to ensure all writes in the function are to local variables or to objects pointed-to (allowed), and that no assignment or side-effect targets any of the parameter variables themselves."
