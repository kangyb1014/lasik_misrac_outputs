  "explanation": "I examined the entire function. There are no unconditional returns, constant-condition conditionals, labels/gotos, or other constructs that would make any statement in this function unreachable at compile time. The early return (if (NULL == tv) return;) is conditional on the runtime value of tv and does not render subsequent code unreachable unconditionally. Both branches of the if (delta < SMALL) ... else ... are reachable depending on the computed runtime value of delta. The (void) casts simply silence unused-parameter warnings and do not create unreachable statements. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that raise an immediate concern under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code)."
