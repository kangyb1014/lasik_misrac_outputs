  "explanation": "For MISRA C unreachable-code analysis you must know which branches/lines in completed_callback can ever be executed at run time. Each listed symbol is required because:\n\n- SMALL (macro/constant and its type): The conditional if (delta < SMALL) controls two mutually exclusive code paths. If SMALL is a value that makes that comparison always false (e.g. 0) or always true, one branch becomes provably unreachable. The type (signed/unsigned) can also affect the comparison semantics.\n\n- small_deltas (array: declaration, element type and length): The small_deltas[] access is in the true branch. You must know the array size and type to determine whether that element access is valid and whether the increment can ever be executed (for example, if the array length is zero or if SMALL is outside the array bounds, the code could be unreachable or erroneous).\n\n- Code that initializes *req_cls (function(s) that allocate/assign the struct timeval pointer into req_cls): The first statement returns when *req_cls (tv) is NULL. To know whether the remainder of the function (gettimeofday, delta calculation, branches, free(tv)) is reachable you must inspect where and how req_cls is set during request handling (is it always NULL, sometimes non-NULL, or always non-NULL?).\n\n- Code that clears or resets *req_cls before completed_callback (any cleanup that sets it to NULL): If higher-level request cleanup always clears or frees the stored pointer before this callback runs, then large parts of the function (including free(tv)) may be unreachable. You need those symbols/paths to prove reachability.\n\n- Callsites / registration of completed_callback (where the callback is passed to the MHD library or otherwise referenced): If completed_callback is never registered or referenced (the static function is not used), the entire function is unreachable. Therefore you must include the places that reference or register this callback to determine whether the function itself can ever be executed.\n\nProvide the exact definitions/locations for these symbols (macro value, array declaration, names of initializer/cleanup functions, and callback registration sites) to allow a conclusive unreachable-code analysis."
