  "explanation": "Only pointer declarations/usages that could reasonably be const-qualified are reported. The unused parameters cls and connection are passed only for context and never modified \u2014 they may be candidates for pointing-to-const. The request-class parameter req_cls and the local pointer tv are pointer usages that warrant inspection to determine whether the pointed-to type could be const-qualified (and whether ownership/freeing semantics prevent making them const). The call to free(tv) is included because it affects whether tv (and therefore the pointer type propagated through req_cls) can be const-qualified. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: numeric types and arithmetic (delta, SMALL, small_deltas), the local non-pointer timeval variable tve, the gettimeofday call (its first argument is a modifiable local object), the explicit (void) casts to silence unused-parameter warnings, and the fprintf call are unrelated to pointer const-qualification and so are not reported."
