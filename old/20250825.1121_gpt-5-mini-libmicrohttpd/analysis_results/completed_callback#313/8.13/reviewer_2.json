According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer that does not modify the pointee should be to a const-qualified type. Therefore this should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection' (or the parameter removed if unused).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 indeed recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types when the pointee is not modified, but this is phrased as \"whenever possible\". completed_callback is an implementation of a library callback with a fixed prototype (it must match the MHD callback type), so you cannot change the parameter type to \"const struct MHD_Connection *\" without breaking the required function-pointer type. The current code correctly leaves the signature as required by the API and suppresses the unused-parameter warning with (void) connection;. Thus this is an acceptable and expected exception to the guidance in 8.13."
