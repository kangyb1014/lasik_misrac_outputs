  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C pointer-const analysis:\n\n1) struct timeval (definition)\n   - The pointer tv is declared as 'struct timeval *'. To decide whether tv (or pointers derived from req_cls) could/should be const-qualified we must know the object type and whether its members are modified by this function or elsewhere. Also frees are applied to tv; knowing the exact type and its ownership semantics helps determine if a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate.\n\n2) free (prototype, <stdlib.h>)\n   - free has signature void free(void *). If the pointed-to object were declared const (e.g. const struct timeval *), calling free would require casting away const, which violates const-correctness. The prototype is needed to check whether making tv or the pointee const is compatible without discarding qualifiers.\n\n3) small_deltas (declaration and element type/qualifier)\n   - The function modifies small_deltas[delta] (++). This global is non-const; its declaration/qualifier (and element type) is needed to understand what the function mutates and to reason about whether any pointer parameters could be made const without preventing required modifications to global state. It also helps determine whether delta is in-bounds and whether small_deltas uses the same integer types (affects whether const qualification of related pointers is safe).\n\n4) SMALL (macro/constant declaration and type)\n   - The comparison delta < SMALL determines whether the code writes into small_deltas. The type/definition of SMALL is needed to reason about ranges, casting or implicit conversions, and whether passing different qualified pointer types would affect behavior (mainly to reason about side-effects related to the indexing and whether marking any pointer const would inadvertently change intent).\n\n5) Call-site(s) that allocate/assign *req_cls (caller function(s) / request-context storage)\n   - req_cls is void **. To decide the correct const qualification you must inspect the code that creates/owns the pointer stored at *req_cls: who allocates it, who expects ownership transfer (is completed_callback responsible for freeing the pointee?), and whether other callers modify *req_cls or the pointee. If this function frees the pointee, it implies ownership semantics that prevent marking the pointee type as const. If callers expect this routine only to read the pointer value (not change it), req_cls could be a pointer-to-const-pointer (void * const *). The callers' signatures and usage are therefore essential.\n\n6) gettimeofday (prototype, <sys/time.h>)\n   - The function calls gettimeofday(&tve, NULL). Knowing the prototype verifies that gettimeofday writes into its first argument (i.e., tve is an output), confirming tve is a mutable local and not a candidate for const. This is relevant context when reasoning about why tv (the received pointer) is used only for reads but the function still frees the object \u2014 influencing whether const qualification is appropriate for the parameter pointing to that object.\n\n7) struct MHD_Connection (definition / forward declaration)\n   - connection is declared 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' (unused here). MISRA recommends pointers that are not modified be declared pointing to const-qualified types where possible. To assess whether connection could be declared 'const struct MHD_Connection *' we need the type definition (or at least to know if it is an opaque type and whether const qualification is allowed by callers / API).\n\n8) enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode (definition)\n   - toe is an enum parameter (unused). To decide whether it should be declared const (note: const qualification on plain enum parameters is uncommon, but MISRA's phrase relates to pointers), and more generally to know whether changing pointer parameter constness would be compatible with the external API, the enum definition and its use-sites help determine safe signature changes.\n\nIn short: to determine compliance with the MISRA guideline about adding const where possible you must know (a) the exact object types involved (struct timeval, MHD types), (b) ownership/aliasing and who frees or modifies the objects (callers that set *req_cls and the free prototype), and (c) global state modified by the routine (small_deltas/SMALL). These symbols let the next analyst determine which pointer parameters (cls, connection, req_cls, tv) could legitimately and safely be changed to point-to-const without breaking ownership, API compatibility, or introducing casts that discard qualifiers."
