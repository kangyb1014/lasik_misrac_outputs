The function only reads *req_cls (assigns it to tv) and does not modify the pointer stored at *req_cls, so the pointed-to type could be const-qualified. It should be declared as 'void * const *req_cls' to indicate that *req_cls will not be modified. Keeping it as 'void **' therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The completed_callback signature matches the libmicrohttpd callback prototype (void ** con_cls / req_cls) which is mandated by the external API; you cannot change it to void * const * without breaking the required function type. MISRA's recommendation that \u201ca pointer should point to a const\u2011qualified type whenever possible\u201d is intended to be applied where you control the interface; it does not force changing a function that must match an externally specified prototype. Additionally, the non-const pointer is semantically appropriate here because the library API expects handlers to be able to modify the connection context pointer. Therefore this use does not constitute a definite MISRA 8.13 violation in this context."
