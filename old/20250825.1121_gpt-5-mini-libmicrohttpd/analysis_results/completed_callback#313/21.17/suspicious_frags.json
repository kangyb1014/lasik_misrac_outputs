  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the completed_callback code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (bounds of objects referenced by string.h pointer parameters) is not directly applicable. The remaining pointer/array operations have explicit guards or are unrelated to string handling: - The pointer tv is tested for NULL before being dereferenced and freed. - The array access small_deltas[delta] is performed only after the check if (delta < SMALL), preventing out-of-bounds access. - fprintf is used only to print a numeric value (format specifier via PRIu64); this does not invoke any string.h routine that could read/write beyond pointer bounds. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17. (Note: other potential issues such as signed/unsigned underflow in the delta computation or whether *req_cls originates from a malloc()ed pointer are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and so are not reported here.)"
