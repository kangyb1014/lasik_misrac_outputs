  "scenario": "No violation in the shown code: completed_callback calls the POSIX gettimeofday function, which does not call completed_callback, so there is no direct or indirect recursion. A possible violating scenario would be if gettimeofday were replaced by a macro or wrapper that invoked completed_callback (directly or via another chain of calls), which would create indirect recursion and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
