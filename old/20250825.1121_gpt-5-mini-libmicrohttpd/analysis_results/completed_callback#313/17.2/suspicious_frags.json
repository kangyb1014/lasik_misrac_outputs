  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 17.2 concerns direct or indirect calls that could result in recursion. The only statements in this function that perform external function calls are the three fragments listed above; these should be investigated to determine whether those called functions (or functions they call) could call back into completed_callback. All other lines in the function do not perform function calls and therefore cannot create an indirect recursive call chain: the declarations, the (void) unused-parameter casts, the NULL check and return, the time-delta arithmetic, the array increment small_deltas[delta]++, and the if/else control structure are not function calls and thus need not be investigated for Rule 17.2. Note also that any registration or invocation of completed_callback (e.g. in the library that calls this callback) is outside the shown snippet and should be examined separately if relevant."
