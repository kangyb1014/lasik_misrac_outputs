  "explanation": "To determine whether completed_callback violates the MISRA rule against (direct or indirect) self\u2011calls you must inspect: 1) all direct callees in the function so you can follow their transitive call graph (a recursion cycle could travel through any of them), and 2) all callers/dispatchers that invoke this callback (an indirect recursion can include the dispatcher path back into completed_callback). The listed symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- gettimeofday: Completed_callback calls gettimeofday directly. To prove no indirect recursion you must examine gettimeofday and its transitive callees (or at least verify it cannot call back into application code that could reach completed_callback).\n\n- fprintf: Called directly; standard I/O implementations may call other library hooks or user-supplied functions in unusual builds. You must examine fprintf (and the functions it calls) to ensure no path leads back to completed_callback.\n\n- free: Called directly; in some environments free can invoke user hooks (e.g. free hooks, destructors) that might call application code. Verify free (and any hooked alloc/free code) cannot lead back to completed_callback.\n\n- small_deltas: Global data written by the function. Although not a function, include it so the analyzer can find any accessor functions or side-effecting wrappers that might be called elsewhere and form part of a recursion cycle.\n\n- SMALL: Macro/constant used to select two branches. Include it so the analyzer can reason about which branch is taken and whether the fprintf path (or the small_deltas[] path) is exercised; this matters when exploring possible call paths.\n\n- CALLERS_OF_completed_callback (all functions that register/invoke this callback in the MHD/library code): To detect indirect recursion you must include every function that can call completed_callback (callback registrars/dispatchers in the MHD library or in this translation unit). The static callers (names from the provided call graph) must be analyzed to see if any transitive path from completed_callback returns to completed_callback.\n\nIn short: include all direct callees so their transitive call graphs can be inspected, include the global/data symbols referenced to catch any accessor/hook functions, and include every caller/dispatcher of completed_callback (from the static call graph) to search for cycles that would constitute indirect recursion."
