  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or constructs are present (no __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions, or other known vendor extensions).\n- All types used are from standard C (uint64_t, enum) or POSIX (struct timeval). The use of PRIu64 is the standard inttypes.h printf macro, not an extension.\n- The long long literal suffix (LL) is a standard C99 feature, not a compiler extension.\n- The (void) casts to silence unused-parameter warnings are standard C idiom.\n- The SMALL macro is an integer constant expression used to size an array; this is standard-compliant.\n- Library calls used (gettimeofday, fprintf, free) are standard C/POSIX APIs, not compiler language extensions.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
