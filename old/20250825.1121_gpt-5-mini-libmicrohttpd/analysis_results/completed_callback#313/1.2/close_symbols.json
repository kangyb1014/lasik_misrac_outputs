  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about language extensions you must inspect any external definitions/macros/types referenced by the function to see whether they themselves rely on compiler-specific extensions or expand to non\u2011standard constructs. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- SMALL: The comparison delta < SMALL controls a branch; SMALL could be a macro or a constant that might be defined using compiler extensions (e.g. nonstandard attributes, unusual suffixes). Inspect its definition to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- small_deltas: The array/object indexed by delta; you must know its declared type and size to confirm the indexing uses standard types and does not rely on compiler extensions (e.g. bit\u2011field arrays, compiler-specific pointer/indexing behavior).\n\n- PRIu64: This printf format macro is implementation-defined (from inttypes.h). Some platforms implement it with nonstandard format tokens (e.g. MSVC uses \"%I64u\"). You need the exact macro expansion to verify the format string does not use compiler\u2011specific extensions.\n\n- uint64_t: This typedef comes from stdint.h (C99). You need its definition/availability to confirm the code relies on standard fixed-width types (C99) rather than vendor extensions or alternative typedefs.\n\n- struct timeval (definition): timeval is not a built\u2011in C type (POSIX). Its layout/definition must be inspected to ensure the code does not rely on compiler/OS extensions or nonstandard members.\n\n- gettimeofday (declaration): gettimeofday is POSIX (not ISO C). To decide if its use constitutes a language/library extension prohibited by your interpretation of MISRA, you must see its declaration and whether the project allows POSIX APIs or if the particular declaration uses any compiler extensions.\n\n- MHD_Connection (type/definition): Provided by the embedding library (libmicrohttpd). Even though the parameter is unused, its definition could use compiler extensions (attributes, nonstandard keywords) \u2014 inspect it to be safe.\n\n- MHD_RequestTerminationCode (enum/definition): Same reasoning as MHD_Connection \u2014 verify the enum definition does not use compiler extensions.\n\n- NULL (macro): Verify how NULL is defined in the environment; some implementations use compiler-specific definitions (though rare).\n\n- fprintf (declaration): Standard C, but you should verify the linked stdio header and any overridden implementation do not use compiler-specific extensions that affect use here (primarily to accompany PRIu64 check).\n\n- stdout (object): Standard, but inspect its declaration/definition in the environment if nonstandard headers/implementations are used.\n\n- free (declaration): Standard, but include to check that its prototype is the standard one and not a compiler\u2011specific variant.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/expansions of the above symbols (especially PRIu64, uint64_t, SMALL, small_deltas, struct timeval, and gettimeofday) to determine whether any of them or their uses rely on compiler or platform language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
