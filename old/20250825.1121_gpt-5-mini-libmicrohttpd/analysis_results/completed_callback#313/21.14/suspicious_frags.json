  "explanation": "I examined the provided completed_callback function and the related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp, no macros that expand to memcmp, and no code that uses memcmp to compare C strings. The function performs numeric/time arithmetic, a NULL pointer check (for tv), array indexing (small_deltas[delta]) and calls to gettimeofday, fprintf and free \u2014 none of which are the Standard Library memcmp or string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If additional files or macros (not provided) introduce memcmp usage, those would need to be checked, but nothing in the given snippets does so."
