  "explanation": "For assessing the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings we must inspect any symbol used by completed_callback that could (a) be a macro that expands to memcmp, (b) be a wrapper that calls memcmp, or (c) hide string comparisons in its definition. Brief reasons: \n\n- SMALL: macro/constant used in the branch; its definition could be a macro or expression that references or expands to code that uses memcmp or performs string comparisons. Must inspect.\n- small_deltas: external array/identifier indexed here; its declaration could be a macro or accessor wrapper that invokes string comparison functions (or be an alias to a data structure whose access uses helper functions). Must inspect its definition.\n- gettimeofday: called function; although normally not related to strings, it could be replaced by a project wrapper (macro/function) that internally uses memcmp. Check its declaration/definition to rule out hidden memcmp usage.\n- fprintf: called to print delta; project may replace or wrap fprintf with a logging function that compares strings (possibly via memcmp). Must inspect wrapper/definition.\n- stdout: the FILE* object used by fprintf; inspect any project redefinition/macros that might make I/O calls call string comparison helpers.\n- PRIu64: formatting macro from inttypes.h; macro expansion should be inspected to ensure it is not redefined to something that uses memcmp.\n- free: called to release tv; project could provide a wrapper macro/function for free that does additional checks (string comparisons). Inspect its declaration/definition.\n- struct timeval: type of the object dereferenced from req_cls; need its definition to ensure req_cls truly points to a timeval and not to a string/structure that could indicate prior use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- uint64_t: integer typedef used for delta; include to resolve PRIu64 and to ensure integer type resolution (headers/typedefs may hide macros).\n- inttypes.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, sys/time.h: the standard headers that define PRIu64, fprintf/stdout, free, and struct timeval. The analysis should look at project includes/overrides of these headers or macro redefinitions to determine if memcmp is introduced via header redefinition.\n\nIn short: inspect these symbols/headers to ensure none are project\u2011level macros/wrappers or redefinitions that introduce uses of memcmp when handling strings. The target function itself does not call memcmp, but any of the above could hide or expand to memcmp calls that would trigger the MISRA rule."
