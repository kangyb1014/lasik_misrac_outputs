  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The cast-to-void idiom (e.g. (void) connection;) is an explicit way to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to silence compiler warnings; it has no side effects, but its presence is a documentation/diagnostic aid rather than an accidental leftover of logic. MISRA\u2019s Rule 2.2 targets genuinely dead code that is part of the program logic and whose removal would not affect program behaviour; the unused-parameter idiom is a deliberate, acceptable pattern to communicate intent and suppress warnings. If a project\u2019s toolset nevertheless flags this, the usual remedy is to use a project-approved UNUSED_PARAM macro or other agreed annotation rather than removing the intent-preserving statement. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim that that line is a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
