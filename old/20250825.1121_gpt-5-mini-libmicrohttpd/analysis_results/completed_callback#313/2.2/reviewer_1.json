  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u201c(void) toe;\u201d is an expression statement that evaluates and discards the parameter; whether that constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 depends on whether removing the statement would change the program\u2019s observable behaviour. Rule 2.2 defines dead code as operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour; Note 1 explicitly reminds that timing can be part of observable behaviour in embedded systems. You cannot conclude from the source alone that removing the cast would have no effect (e.g. it could affect timing) and therefore prove it is dead code. In short, the mere presence of an unused-parameter suppression cast is not automatically a Rule 2.2 violation \u2014 its removal might or might not change behaviour, so Agent A\u2019s blanket claim is incorrect."
