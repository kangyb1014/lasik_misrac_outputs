Removing this statement does not change program behaviour (the parameter has no side-effects, is not volatile, and is otherwise unused), so the operation meets the definition of dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function completed_callback:\n#define SMALL (1024*128)\n...\nstatic unsigned int small_deltas[SMALL]\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The (void) cls; (and the similar lines for connection and toe) are expression-statements that do nothing at run-time. They are executed but have no effect; removing them would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour. That exactly matches MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d). Therefore Agent A\u2019s report is correct. (If the intent is only to silence compiler warnings, fix options include removing/renaming unused parameter identifiers where allowed, using a compiler-supported unused-attribute, or otherwise ensuring the parameter is formally handled rather than leaving a no-op expression.)"
