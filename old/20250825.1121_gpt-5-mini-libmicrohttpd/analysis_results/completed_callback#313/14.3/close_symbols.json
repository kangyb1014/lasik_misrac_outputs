  "explanation": "To check MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' you must inspect the two controlling expressions in this function: 'if (NULL == tv)' and 'if (delta < SMALL)'. 1) SMALL: if SMALL is a compile-time constant or unusual value it affects whether 'delta < SMALL' can be an invariant (always true/false) \u2014 you need the macro/value and its type. 2) small_deltas: its type, size and qualifiers (e.g. volatile/const) are needed to understand indexing and whether the code relies on side-effects that could make the comparison effectively invariant or unsafe; also to ensure the index delta is bounded by SMALL. 3) struct timeval: the exact types of tv_sec and tv_usec (time_t/long/int) determine the arithmetic that produces delta and whether that arithmetic can produce a constant result (e.g. if types are fixed-width or if overflows/implicit conversions make the expression constant). 4) The code that initializes *req_cls: determining whether 'tv' can ever be NULL (making 'NULL == tv' a constant true/false) requires knowing where and how req_cls is set for this callback (the request-setup path that allocates/assigns the timeval). 5) gettimeofday: its observable behaviour (it returns current wall-clock time and is not a compile-time constant) is required to conclude that delta is runtime-varying; if a different/time-invariant implementation were used it could make 'delta < SMALL' invariant. Collecting these symbols lets an analyser decide whether either controlling expression can be proved invariant (and thus a MISRA violation) or is legitimately runtime-varying."
