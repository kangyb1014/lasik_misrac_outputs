  "explanation": "The only controlling expressions in this function are:\n- if (NULL == tv)\n- if (delta < SMALL)\nNeither is an invariant: tv is obtained from *req_cls at runtime and may be NULL or non-NULL depending on the caller; delta is computed from the runtime gettimeofday() result and the pointed-to timeval and therefore can vary between invocations. There are no loops or other conditional constructs with constant controlling expressions. The code does not contain any do-while with a constant false controlling expression nor any intentionally infinite-loop invariant, so no fragments violate or require investigation for MISRA C Rule 14.3."
