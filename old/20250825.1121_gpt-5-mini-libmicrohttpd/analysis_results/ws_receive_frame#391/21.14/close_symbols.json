  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of the standard function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. You must check whether this function (or any macro it uses) calls memcmp; presence/usage of memcmp is the primary thing being tested.\n\n- malloc: ws_receive_frame allocates msg with malloc(data_length + 1). Knowing malloc is used explains how the buffer for a null-terminated string is obtained and whether sufficient space is allocated before terminating with '\\0'. This matters because the rule applies only when memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings \u2014 we need to confirm the function actually constructs such a string in this code path.\n\n- msg: The local pointer msg is explicitly NUL-terminated (msg[j] = '\\0') in the text-frame path. Identifying msg as a null-terminated string candidate is necessary to decide whether any memcmp usage would be comparing a null-terminated string (the scenario MISRA forbids).\n\n- frame: The input buffer from which msg is derived. Understanding frame contents and how data is copied/xored into msg is needed to determine whether the produced msg is indeed a null-terminated string and thus subject to the MISRA rule if memcmp were used on it.\n\n- length: The pointer/variable guiding how many bytes are read from frame and then stored in msg. It is used to compute data_length and adjust *length; needed to check that the null-termination and buffer sizing are consistent and to determine if any comparisons could be made against null-terminated data.\n\n- WS_FIN: This WebSocket FIN bit constant controls the branch that produces a null-terminated msg. Knowing its value/meaning is necessary to determine when the code path that creates a null-terminated string is taken.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: Used with WS_FIN to identify the text-frame branch. The NUL-terminated msg is only produced for text frames; therefore this symbol is needed to understand the condition under which a null-terminated string exists.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: Controls the close-frame branch. Including it clarifies other branches that do not produce a null-terminated string and therefore are irrelevant to the memcmp rule.\n\nNotes: The target function itself does not call any other functions (static call graph shows no callees). The key for MISRA memcmp rule analysis is (1) whether memcmp is invoked here (or via macros/inline expansions) and (2) whether a null-terminated string (msg) is produced that could be compared with memcmp. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to answer those points for this function."
