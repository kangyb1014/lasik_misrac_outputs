  "explanation": "WS_FIN, WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME, WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: The comparisons in the function (e.g. frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME) and frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME)) use these macros/enum values. To decide whether those controlling expressions are invariant you must know the exact constant values and bit-layout of these macros (and whether they expand to compile-time constants). If the macro values or their combination would make the comparison a compile-time constant or otherwise force the branch always/never taken, that would be an invariant controlling expression. run_usock: This is the sole caller of ws_receive_frame (per the call graph). To determine whether the controlling expressions are actually invariant at runtime you must inspect how run_usock constructs and passes the frame buffer and the length pointer (e.g. does it always pass a buffer with the same contents or a constant length, or repeatedly call ws_receive_frame with invariant arguments). Specifically you need to see how frame[] and *length (the object pointed to by length) are initialized and whether they can vary across calls or during the call. Without the caller\u2019s code you cannot conclude whether expressions such as frame[0], frame[1], flength (mask & 0x7F) or *length are invariant in practice."
