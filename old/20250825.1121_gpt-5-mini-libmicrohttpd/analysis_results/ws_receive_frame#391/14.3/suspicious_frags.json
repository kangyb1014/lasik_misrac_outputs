  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the supplied code depend on runtime values or loop indices and therefore are not invariant: - if (frame[0] == (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME)) and the subsequent else/else-if branches compare runtime byte values from the received frame. - if (flength == 126) / else if (flength == 127) use flength computed from frame[1]. - for (i = idx_first_data, j = 0; i < *length; i++, j++) uses the loop index i compared against *length (a runtime value) so the controlling expression is not invariant. - if (NULL != msg), if (0 >= got), if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME), and other ifs evaluate results of functions or data read at runtime. - for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++) is variant because i is incremented each iteration. - Calls to pthread_mutex_lock, recv, malloc, snprintf, etc., produce runtime-dependent results used in conditions. There are no do-while loops present that would fall under the do-while exception. Therefore, aside from the single reported invariant controlling expression, no other controlling expressions appear to be invariant and require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
