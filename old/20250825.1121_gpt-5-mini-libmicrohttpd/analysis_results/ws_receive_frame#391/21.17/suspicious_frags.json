  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are simple declarations, constant assignments, or control-flow constructs that do not perform indexed reads/writes on the buffer pointer parameters (frame or msg) or calls to <string.h> functions. The selected fragments contain direct indexed accesses into the caller-supplied buffer (frame), computed length arithmetic, the allocation of msg, and writes into msg \u2014 all of which require investigation to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses or underflow/overflow in the length computations. Other lines (variable declarations, setting *type to constant, small constant assignments like idx_first_mask = 2, flength = mask & 0x7F, and the enclosing return msg;) do not by themselves introduce accesses beyond object bounds relevant to the <string.h> functions rule and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 21.17."
