Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- run_usock: The direct caller of ws_receive_frame. To decide if code inside ws_receive_frame is dead (removable without changing behavior) you must see how run_usock uses the return value (msg) and the out-parameters (*length, *type). If the caller ignores msg (or never frees it) the allocation/loop may be dead or a leak.\n\n- make_blocking, send_all, MHD_upgrade_action, ws_send_frame: These are other functions that run_usock calls and may interact with message buffers or WebSocket flow. For example run_usock could immediately pass msg to ws_send_frame/send_all or free it; their behavior affects whether creating msg and setting *length/*type have observable effects.\n\n- WS_FIN: The flag masked into frame[0] that determines the FIN bit. Knowing its defined value(s) and intended use is required to determine whether the comparisons in ws_receive_frame can ever be true and therefore whether the branch bodies are reachable/necessary.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME, WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: The opcode constants used in comparisons. Their definitions (values) are required to reason about whether frame[0] can equal (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME) or (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME). If those combinations are impossible in the system, corresponding branches may be dead.\n\n- other WebSocket opcode macros/defines: To determine if the final else branch (*type = frame[0] & 0x0F) is ever used or redundant, you need the set of possible opcode values in the project and how frame[0] is constructed.\n\n- malloc: The allocation and its success/failure are side-effects. Analysis must consider whether allocating and populating msg has any observable effect on program behavior (or whether it is unnecessary). If custom allocator semantics differ from standard malloc, include its definition.\n\n- free (or any caller-side deallocator): Whether the allocated buffer is freed by the caller (or otherwise used) decides if the allocation is necessary or just a memory leak. If no deallocation/use exists, the allocation/loop may be dead code.\n\n- the code in run_usock that builds/fills the 'frame' buffer and the associated 'length' value (socket read / buffer-population): To know which branches in ws_receive_frame are possible you must inspect how the input buffer is formed (sizes, header bytes, whether masking/extended lengths 126/127 can occur). If frame contents or length are constrained by the producer such that some branches (e.g. flength==126/127 or masked text frames) cannot occur, those branches would be dead.\n\nRationale: Determining dead code requires whole-program context about which input values and side-effects are possible. The caller(s), constants that control branching, the allocator/deallocator behavior and the place that constructs the input frame are the minimal additional symbols needed to conclude whether one or more operations inside ws_receive_frame are removable without changing program behaviour."
