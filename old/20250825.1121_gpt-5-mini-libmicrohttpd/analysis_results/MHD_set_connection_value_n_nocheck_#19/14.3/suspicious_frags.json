  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. The only conditional expressions are: (NULL == pos) where pos is assigned from the runtime call MHD_connection_alloc_memory_(...), and (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail) which depends on the runtime state of the connection. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) or constant/compile-time expressions used as loop or branch controls. Therefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
