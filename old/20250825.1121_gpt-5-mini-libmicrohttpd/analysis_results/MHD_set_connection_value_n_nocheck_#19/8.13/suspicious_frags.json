  "explanation": "Investigate any place where const-qualified pointers might be discarded or where allocation/typing mismatches could result in non-const pointers being used for const data. The selected fragments cover: the local pointer variable declaration (pos), the allocation using sizeof(struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header) while pos is a pointer-to-Req_Header, and the assignments that bind the function's const char * arguments (key, value) to header/value members. Also included is the full definition of MHD_HTTP_Res_Header because its members are non-const (char *), which is relevant to determining whether const qualification could be lost. Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: numeric assignments (header_size, value_size), enum or next/prev pointer assignments, and the internal memory-pool/reallocation routines operate on void*/char* buffers and do not, by themselves, cause const-qualification issues in the shown usage. The MHD_HTTP_Req_Header definition (with const char * fields) and other assignments that already use const-qualified types are compliant with the rule and therefore are not listed."
