This discards the const qualifier and shows the members could/should be const char *.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ the parameters key and value are declared const char *, but they are stored into struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header members declared as char * (pos->header = key; pos->value = value;). That assignment discards the const qualifier and indicates the members could/should be declared as pointing to const-qualified data. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so the code as shown is non\u2011conforming unless there is a specific, documented reason why the response-side headers must be mutable (i.e. code elsewhere actually writes through those pointers). If mutation of the pointed data is required, the current declaration may be justified; otherwise the correct fix is to change MHD_HTTP_Res_Header::header and ::value to const char * (or otherwise ensure no const is discarded)."
