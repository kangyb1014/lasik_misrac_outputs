True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe function returns 'entry' (type struct UserEntry *) which points into the static user_ids array. The function and the surrounding code only read the UserEntry data (the username is a const char * and the entries are static/read-only in intent), so the pointer could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type. Returning a non-const struct UserEntry * (via the 'return entry;' statement) allows callers to modify the entries and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A suitable fix is to change the function (and the local variable) to return/hold 'const struct UserEntry *' and update callers accordingly.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function find_entry_by_username:\nstatic struct UserEntry user_ids[2]\n...\nstruct UserEntry\n{\n  /**\n   * The username.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *username;\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  /* The cleartext password is not stored in the database.\n     The more secure \"userdigest\" is used instead. */\n  /**\n   * The password.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *password;\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n  /**\n   * The realm for this entry.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *realm;\n\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 1\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_1;\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 2\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_2;\n}\n...\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In the presented code the array user_ids is static and its contents are treated as read-only (comments state \u201cStatic data is used in this example\u201d and no modification is shown). find_entry_by_username returns a struct UserEntry * that points into that read-only table, thereby allowing callers to modify the entries via the returned pointer even though modification is not intended. The clean fix is to make the pointer types const-qualified (for example: static const struct UserEntry *find_entry_by_username(const char *const username) and declare the local variable as const struct UserEntry *entry) and to propagate the const return type to callers (e.g. find_entry_by_userinfo). Note: if there is code elsewhere that legitimately needs to modify the array elements, then returning a non-const pointer would be justified, and no violation would occur; given the provided code and comments, however, the rule is violated."
