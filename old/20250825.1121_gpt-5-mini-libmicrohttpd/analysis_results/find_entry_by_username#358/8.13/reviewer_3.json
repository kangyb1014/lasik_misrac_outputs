True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe static array user_ids is defined as a non-const array (static struct UserEntry user_ids[2]) while it holds static/invariant data. Functions (e.g. find_entry_by_username) return a pointer to struct UserEntry (non-const), so callers can obtain a non-const pointer to data that is effectively immutable. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible; here the pointer could and should point to const-qualified data. Recommended fix: declare the array const (static const struct UserEntry user_ids[2]) and change APIs to return const struct UserEntry * (and adjust callers accordingly).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function find_entry_by_username:\nstatic struct UserEntry user_ids[2]\n...\nstruct UserEntry\n{\n  /**\n   * The username.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *username;\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  /* The cleartext password is not stored in the database.\n     The more secure \"userdigest\" is used instead. */\n  /**\n   * The password.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *password;\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n  /**\n   * The realm for this entry.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *realm;\n\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 1\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_1;\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 2\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_2;\n}\n...\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to a const-qualified type whenever that is feasible. In the shown code find_entry_by_username returns struct UserEntry * which permits callers to modify the pointed-at data even though the data is effectively static/immutable in this example. The function could and should return a pointer qualified with const (const struct UserEntry *), and making the user_ids array itself const (static const struct UserEntry user_ids[2]) would better express intent and avoid accidental modification. Note also that a pointer-to-const may legitimately point at a non-const object, so changing the function return type to const struct UserEntry * is possible without first changing user_ids to const; however making the array const is the stronger, clearer fix. Any callers (e.g. find_entry_by_userinfo and its callers) would need to be updated to accept/propagate the const qualification or be reviewed if they legitimately need to modify the entries. If modification is required by design, then the non-const return may be justified and the rule would not be violated in that context, but given the provided scenario (static/invariant data) the report of a Rule 8.13 violation is correct."
