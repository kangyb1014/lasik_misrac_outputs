  "explanation": "To decide if find_entry_by_username violates the MISRA guidance that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible we must know: \n\n- user_ids: the array being indexed. We must see its declaration (e.g. whether it is declared as const struct UserEntry[] or non-const). If user_ids is const, returning a non-const struct UserEntry * would be incorrect (should return const struct UserEntry *). If it is non-const, a non-const return might be justified.\n\n- struct UserEntry: the type definition (including the type of the username member). We need to know whether members (in particular entry->username) are declared as const char * or char *. That affects const-correctness of uses inside the function and whether fields could/should be const-qualified, and whether the structure as a whole could/should be returned as a pointer-to-const.\n\n- find_entry_by_userinfo: the (only) caller shown in the call graph. To determine whether the function may safely return a pointer-to-const we must inspect how callers use the returned pointer \u2014 whether they only read the UserEntry or whether they modify it. If callers modify the returned object, returning non-const may be necessary; if callers only read it, the API should return a pointer-to-const.\n\n(These three symbols provide the minimal context needed to determine whether the pointer types in this function could/should be const-qualified to satisfy the MISRA rule.)"
