True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'entry' is declared as 'struct UserEntry *' and is assigned from 'user_ids + i'. The user database appears to be static/read-only data (user_ids is a static array and most fields are const-qualified), yet the pointer is not const-qualified. This allows callers or code paths that receive the returned pointer to modify the entries (e.g. entry->allow_area_1 = 0), which is contrary to the intent that the data be immutable. The proper fix is to use const qualification (e.g. make user_ids an array of 'const struct UserEntry' and use 'const struct UserEntry *entry' and return 'const struct UserEntry *').\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function find_entry_by_username:\nstatic struct UserEntry user_ids[2]\n...\nstruct UserEntry\n{\n  /**\n   * The username.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *username;\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  /* The cleartext password is not stored in the database.\n     The more secure \"userdigest\" is used instead. */\n  /**\n   * The password.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *password;\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n  /**\n   * The realm for this entry.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *realm;\n\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 1\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_1;\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 2\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_2;\n}\n...\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA R8.13 encourages using const for pointer targets that are immutable, but in the provided code the user database is not declared const: user_ids is defined as \"static struct UserEntry user_ids[2]\" (not \"const\"), and the struct contains mutable members (e.g. allow_area_1/allow_area_2 and various hash arrays). Because the underlying objects are non-const and the API (find_entry_by_userinfo, etc.) returns non-const pointers, the local pointer and function return type must remain non-const to allow legitimate modification. If the data were truly intended to be immutable, the correct fix would be to make user_ids (and the return types) const-qualified \u2014 only then would R8.13 apply. As written, there is no R8.13 violation."
