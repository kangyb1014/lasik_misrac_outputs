The local pointer 'struct UserEntry *entry' points to elements of the static user_ids array and is only used for read access (strcmp on entry->username). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 this should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry') and the function should return a const-qualified pointer (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *find_entry_by_username(...)') unless callers need to modify the entries.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s report is essentially correct. Inside find_entry_by_username the local pointer entry is only used for read access (strcmp on entry->username) and therefore could be declared as const struct UserEntry *entry to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. That is, a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Note that the static array user_ids is not declared const, but it is perfectly valid to have a pointer-to-const refer to a non-const object (meaning you promise not to modify it via that pointer).\n\nWhether the function\u2019s return type must be changed to const struct UserEntry * depends on the wider API: find_entry_by_userinfo and other callers currently expect a mutable (non-const) struct UserEntry *; changing the return type would require updating those callers. So the minimal MISRA fix is to make the local pointer const, while changing the function return type is only required if callers do not need to modify the entries. As written, at least the local pointer violates Rule 8.13, so the reported violation is correct."
