True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nfind_entry_by_username returns a non-const pointer (struct UserEntry *) to elements of the static user_ids array. The function could (and should) return a pointer to const (const struct UserEntry *) because the entries are effectively read-only in this example (their string members are const and the table appears static). Returning a modifiable pointer allows callers to modify the entries and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 which requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function find_entry_by_username:\nstatic struct UserEntry user_ids[2]\n...\nstruct UserEntry\n{\n  /**\n   * The username.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *username;\n#if 0 /* Disabled code */\n  /* The cleartext password is not stored in the database.\n     The more secure \"userdigest\" is used instead. */\n  /**\n   * The password.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *password;\n#endif /* Disabled code */\n  /**\n   * The realm for this entry.\n   * Static data is used in this example.\n   * In real application dynamic buffer or fixed size array could be used.\n   */\n  const char *realm;\n\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The MD5 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_md5[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha256[MHD_SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username together with the realm.\n   * This hash can be used by the client to send the username in encrypted\n   * form.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to hide user identity when transmitting\n   * requests over insecure link.\n   */\n  uint8_t userhash_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n  /**\n   * The SHA-512/256 hash of the username with the password and the realm.\n   * It is used to verify that password used by the client matches password\n   * required by the server.\n   * The purpose of userhash is to avoid keeping the password in cleartext\n   * on the server side.\n   */\n  uint8_t userdigest_sha512_256[MHD_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE];\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 1\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_1;\n\n  /**\n   * User has access to \"area 2\" if non-zero\n   */\n  int allow_area_2;\n}\n...\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 encourages using pointers to const when the pointed-to object is logically immutable, but in the provided code the UserEntry objects are not immutable: user_ids is declared as a non-const array (static struct UserEntry user_ids[2]) and the struct contains modifiable members (uint8_t hash arrays and int flags). Moreover find_entry_by_userinfo returns a non-const pointer and forwards that pointer; changing find_entry_by_username to return const struct UserEntry * would force API changes and would prevent legitimate modifications of the mutable fields. If the table truly were intended read-only, the right fix would be to make the table itself const (e.g. static const struct UserEntry user_ids[] ) and then return const struct UserEntry *. Given the current definitions and usage, returning a non-const pointer is appropriate, so there is no MISRA 8.13 violation here."
