  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct in the given scenario. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers be declared to point to const-qualified types whenever possible (i.e. when the pointed-to object is not intended to be modified through the pointer). find_entry_by_username and find_entry_by_userinfo return a non-const struct UserEntry * that points into a static table of entries that the scenario describes as read-only. Since the functions do not modify the entries, and callers should not need to modify static table entries, the return type should be const struct UserEntry * (or the table itself declared const) to enforce immutability. Note the usual caveat: if code elsewhere intentionally needs to modify those entries, then returning a non-const pointer is required and the reported violation would not apply. Given the example\u2019s intent of static/read-only data, the agent\u2019s report is correct."
