  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Yes. The local pointer 'struct UserEntry *entry' points to elements of the static user_ids array and is only used for read access (strcmp on entry->username). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 this should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry') and the function should return a const-qualified pointer (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *find_entry_by_username(...)') unless callers need to modify the entries. As written, a non-const pointer is used even though const qualification is possible, so the rule is violated."
