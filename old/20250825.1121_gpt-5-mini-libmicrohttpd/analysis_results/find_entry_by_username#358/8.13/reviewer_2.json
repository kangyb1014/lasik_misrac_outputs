According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. return const struct UserEntry * and/or declare user_ids as const).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is correct in the likely intent of MISRA C: the function returns a non-const pointer to entries that are treated as static/read\u2011only data. Rule 8.13 advises that pointer targets should be const-qualified whenever possible; here the function only reads the entries and could instead return const struct UserEntry * (and/or declare user_ids const), which would satisfy the rule. Caveat: if other code legitimately needs to modify the returned UserEntry objects, then the non-const return is required and no violation exists. In the excerpt provided there is no evidence of such modification, so the rule is breached as written."
