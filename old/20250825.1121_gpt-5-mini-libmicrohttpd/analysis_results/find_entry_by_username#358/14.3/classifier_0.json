  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])) is not invariant because i changes each iteration. The sizeof(...) subexpression is constant, but the overall controlling expression varies as i is incremented, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is not violated."
