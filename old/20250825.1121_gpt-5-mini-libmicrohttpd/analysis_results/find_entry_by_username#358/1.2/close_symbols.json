  "explanation": "- user_ids: Need its declaration/definition to determine whether it is an array or a pointer, whether it uses non\u2011standard initializers or placement (e.g. section attributes, packed/aligned attributes, designated initializers using compiler extensions), or an incomplete/flexible array \u2014 any of which could be compiler extensions.\n- struct UserEntry: The struct definition is required to check for use of language extensions inside the type (anonymous/unnamed structs or unions, bit\u2011fields with implementation\u2011defined behavior, flexible array members, __attribute__ decorations, or other compiler\u2011specific extensions).\n- strcmp (declaration/prototype): To verify whether strcmp is a normal library function or replaced/aliased by a macro or compiler builtin (some toolchains provide builtin/macro variants or non\u2011standard prototypes), which could indicate use of an extension.\n- size_t typedef (from headers): To confirm size_t is the standard typedef and not redefined by a compiler extension or macro in this translation unit.\n- NULL macro/definition: To check whether NULL expands to a standard null pointer constant or to some non\u2011standard construct introduced by macros or extensions.\n- file-scope declarations and macros in the same translation unit (e.g. any __attribute__, #pragma, __extension__, compiler-specific macros): Many language extensions are applied via attributes, pragmas or macros at file scope or on the declarations used by the function (user_ids, struct UserEntry, function attributes). The full set of file\u2011scope declarations/macros is needed to detect such extensions.\n\nThese symbols collectively let the analyzer detect any compiler or language extensions that affect the function (in type/layout, object declarations, or called/used library symbols) so the MISRA rule about language extensions can be evaluated correctly."
