Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of find_entry_by_username:\n```c\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_username (const char *const username)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); ++i)\n  {\n    struct UserEntry *entry;\n\n    entry = user_ids + i;\n    if (0 == strcmp (username, entry->username))\n      return entry;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_username (const char *const username)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); ++i)\n  {\n    struct UserEntry *entry;\n\n    entry = user_ids + i;\n    if (0 == strcmp (username, entry->username))\n      return entry;\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: within the function every executed operation affects program behaviour (the loop, the assignment to entry, the strcmp and the returns). Nothing shown is redundant. Note: if this function is static and not referenced anywhere in the translation unit (i.e. never called), then the whole function would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
