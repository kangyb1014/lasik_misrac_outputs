  "explanation": "To determine whether find_entry_by_username violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must know whether this call actually invokes memcmp or otherwise compares NUL\u2011terminated strings with memcmp. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- strcmp: The function call in the target is strcmp. You must inspect strcmp's declaration/definition (or whether it is an inline/linked wrapper) to see if it is implemented by, or aliased to, memcmp or any memcmp-based routine.\n\n- memcmp: Check the memcmp implementation and any references to it in the project or C library used by the build. If strcmp (or a strcmp wrapper/macro) resolves to memcmp or calls memcmp to compare C strings, that would constitute a violation.\n\n- user_ids: The array/object iterated over in the function. Its definition/initializer may show how usernames are stored (e.g. pointers vs fixed char arrays) and whether any non\u2011standard storage would cause a memcmp usage elsewhere.\n\n- struct UserEntry: The type definition is needed to locate the username field and its exact type, and to find any accessor/wrapper functions that might perform comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- UserEntry.username (the username field/type/size/initializer): You must know whether the field is a NUL\u2011terminated char array (char[]), a pointer (char *), or some other representation. If usernames are not guaranteed NUL\u2011terminated, different comparison functions or memcmp might be used elsewhere; conversely, if they are NUL\u2011terminated but strcmp has been replaced by a memcmp-based routine, that is relevant.\n\n- any project-local macro or wrapper that redefines strcmp (preprocessor symbols): A macro or local function may redefine strcmp to call memcmp or otherwise perform comparisons using memcmp. Preprocessor/compile\u2011time redefinitions must be checked so the apparent call to strcmp is not actually using memcmp.\n\nTogether these symbols let you determine whether the string comparison in find_entry_by_username ultimately uses memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings (MISRA violation) or uses a conforming string comparison."
