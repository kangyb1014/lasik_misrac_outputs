  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided code fragments. The function find_entry_by_username uses strcmp to compare the input username with entry->username, which is the correct Standard Library function for comparing null-terminated strings (Rule 21.14 prohibits memcmp for that purpose). The UserEntry members related to strings (username, realm, password in disabled code) are all const char * and there is no use of memcmp on them in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that require investigation for Rule 21.14. (If other source files exist, memcmp usage in those files should be checked \u2014 no such usage is present in the supplied code.)"
