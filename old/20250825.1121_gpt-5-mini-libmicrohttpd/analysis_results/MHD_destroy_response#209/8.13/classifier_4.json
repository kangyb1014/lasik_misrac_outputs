  "scenario": "The code invokes a function-pointer member (response->crfc). Pointer-to-function targets cannot be const-qualified in C, so Rule 8.13 (that pointers should point to const-qualified types where possible) is not applicable here. Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If crfc were instead a data pointer to modifiable data and the callback did not need to modify it, then lack of a const-qualified pointee could be a violation, but that is not the case in the shown fragment.)"
