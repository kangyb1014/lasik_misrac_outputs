  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not flagged because they involve explicit modification of the pointed-to object or are simple checks and therefore cannot reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types. Examples: the initial NULL check (if (NULL == response) return;) is only a test; the reference-count decrement (0 != --(response->reference_count)) modifies the object; the mutex operations (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&response->mutex), MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&response->mutex), MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_(&response->mutex)) operate on and modify the mutex object and so cannot use a pointer-to-const; and the assignment response->first_header = pos->next obviously modifies that pointer member. These uses make const-qualification of the pointed-to type inappropriate, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13. The listed fragments are those where pointers or pointer targets are passed/used in contexts that may be read-only (or otherwise amenable to const qualification) and thus merit review for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
