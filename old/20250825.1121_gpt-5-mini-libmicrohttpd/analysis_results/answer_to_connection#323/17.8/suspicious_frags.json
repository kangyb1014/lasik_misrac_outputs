  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. There are no assignments to any parameter variables (e.g. no statements like req_cls = ..., upload_data_size = ..., connection = ..., method = ...). The (void) param; lines merely suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not change the parameters. There are also no dereferences that assign through pointer parameters (e.g. no *upload_data_size = ...). Passing pointer parameters to library calls (e.g. MHD_queue_response(connection, ...)) does not count as modifying the parameter variable itself within this function. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
