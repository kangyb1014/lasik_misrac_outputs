  "explanation": "For a sound determination whether any operation in connection_maximize_write_buffer is dead code you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free\n  - The if (0 != free_size) is the primary branch that could be dead. You must know the implementation/specification of MHD_pool_get_free and under which pool states it can return non-zero for the pools used by connections.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate\n  - The body of the if (0 != free_size) depends on MHD_pool_reallocate succeeding and on its behavior (does it ever move the buffer, return NULL on failure, have side effects). To decide if assignments to c->write_buffer and c->write_buffer_size are necessary (or dead) you need its semantics.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace\n  - Used in an assert to document an invariant about in-place reallocation. Even if an assert is compiled out, you need to know the intended invariant to reason about whether the code relying on that invariant is ever required.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro)\n  - Whether asserts generate executable code or are compiled out affects whether those assert calls themselves are dead, and whether conditions protected only by asserts can be assumed or must be treated as possible runtime cases.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition)\n  - You must inspect the fields used (pool, write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset), their types, initial values and any documented invariants to determine whether certain assignments/branches within this function can ever be reached or are redundant.\n\n- struct MemoryPool and pool creation/lifetime functions\n  - To reason about MHD_pool_get_free and MHD_pool_reallocate behavior you need the MemoryPool internals (how free space is tracked, whether pools used for connections can ever return non-zero free space), and how pools are created/managed across the codebase.\n\n- build_header_response and build_connection_chunked_response_footer\n  - These are the callers of connection_maximize_write_buffer (per the call graph). Their call sites and the state they pass (the connection fields and pool) may establish invariants that make parts of the callee dead (e.g. free_size always zero, offsets always a certain relation). You need their implementations to see those invariants.\n\n- buffer_append\n  - This function (used by callers) modifies/write into the write buffer and thus affects write_buffer_append_offset; to know whether resetting offsets after reallocation is redundant you must see how/when append_offset is advanced.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, try_ready_chunked_body, try_grow_read_buffer, connection_shrink_read_buffer, MHD_connection_handle_read\n  - These other functions in the static call graph interact with the same pool or reallocation APIs and/or mutate the same connection buffer fields. To determine whether the reallocation branch or offset-reset logic is ever required (or always required), inspect these functions for allocation/deallocation/resizing patterns and invariants they maintain.\n\nIn short: you need the pool APIs (get_free/reallocate/resizability), the assert macro, the connection and pool data-structures and lifecycle, plus the nearby callers and other buffer-manipulating routines so you can determine whether the conditional branch and the subsequent assignments/offset-reset are ever executed in practice or are redundant (dead) across the program."
