  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the statement is an assertion (mhd_assert) that performs a runtime check and does not by itself make any subsequent code unreachable. A Rule 2.1 violation would only occur if the assert macro expanded to code that unconditionally prevented progress (for example, an unconditional infinite loop or exit/abort), or if the condition were provably always false so that the compiler can determine the following code can never be executed. Neither of those situations is inherent in the given fragment."
