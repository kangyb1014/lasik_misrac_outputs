  "explanation": "For checking whether any statements in connection_maximize_write_buffer are provably unreachable in the whole project, the analyzer must know all definitions and call-site invariants that can force conditions to be always true or always false. Concretely:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): the function reads and writes connection->pool, write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, and write_buffer_send_offset. The exact types and any invariants/initialization constraints on these members are needed to determine whether branches (for example the inner equality test of offsets) can ever be taken.\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition): to understand the pool state and whether 'free' can ever be non-zero for a given pool instance; necessary to decide reachability of the outer if (0 != free_size) block.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free (implementation): directly determines free_size. If this function (by logic or invariants) can only return 0 for the pools used by callers, the entire if-body is unreachable. You must inspect its code/contract.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (implementation): the allocation call and its documented behavior (may move pointer or not, allocation-from-end semantics) affect whether later assertions/assignments are meaningful; its side effects and failure modes may also render later statements unreachable.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (implementation): used in an assert guarding reallocation assumptions; if this predicate is always false/true in project contexts it may indicate impossible paths (or an assert that aborts) that affect reachability reasoning.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/implementation): assertions may be compiled out or may terminate execution on failure. To judge reachability you must know whether an assert can make subsequent code unreachable (e.g. abort/longjmp) or is a no-op.\n\n- build_header_response (implementation) and build_connection_chunked_response_footer (implementation): these are the only callers of connection_maximize_write_buffer (per the call graph). To prove that a branch inside connection_maximize_write_buffer is unreachable in the project you must inspect each caller's calling context and the state they establish on the connection and pool prior to the call (e.g. whether they always call with a pool that has zero free space, or with offsets that force one branch outcome).\n\n- buffer_append (implementation): called by build_header_response and likely mutates the write buffer append/send offsets or pool usage. Its behavior may establish invariants on append/send offsets that make the inner equality branch always true/false at the time of call.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, try_ready_chunked_body, try_grow_read_buffer, connection_shrink_read_buffer, MHD_connection_handle_read (implementations): these functions appear in the call graph as other allocators/consumers of the MemoryPool or as routines that reallocate buffers. They can change pool free space and connection offset invariants over the lifetime of a connection. To determine whether the outer if-body or inner offset-equality branch can ever be reached from any project execution path you must inspect these alloc/free/reallocation sites and their interaction with the pool and the connection fields.\n\n(Additionally, basic macros/types such as NULL and size_t are assumed available from standard headers and need no further explanation.)"
