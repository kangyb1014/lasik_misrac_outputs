  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not selected because they do not present plausible unreachable-code issues: - Declarations and the aliasing assignment (struct pointer declarations and 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;') are simple definitions executed when the function is entered and cannot be statically unreachable. - The call and assignment 'free_size = MHD_pool_get_free (pool);' is an ordinary function call whose result controls the if-condition; the call itself is reachable. Whether the if-body executes depends on the runtime return value (hence the if-block was selected for investigation), but the call itself is not unreachable. - Simple assignments after a successful reallocation (e.g. 'c->write_buffer = new_buf;' and 'c->write_buffer_size = new_size;') are reachable only as part of the if-body and are therefore covered by that selected fragment. - The final return statement ('return c->write_buffer_size - c->write_buffer_append_offset;') is the function exit point and is reachable on every control path, so it does not indicate unreachable code. - Comment lines and the overall function signature do not introduce unreachable code. The selected fragments cover all points where control-flow might make code unreachable (the conditional expansion path, the inner reset branch, and the assertions documenting invariants). Other lines are either obviously reachable or are subsumed by those selected regions."
