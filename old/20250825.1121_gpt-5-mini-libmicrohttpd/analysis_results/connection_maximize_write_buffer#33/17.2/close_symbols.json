  "explanation": "To decide whether connection_maximize_write_buffer participates in a call-cycle (direct or indirect recursion) you must inspect the implementations of every function it invokes (and any functions those invoke). Rationale for each required symbol:\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: Called at the start of connection_maximize_write_buffer. You must verify that MHD_pool_get_free does not (directly or indirectly) call back into connection_maximize_write_buffer or into any function that eventually calls it.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Called to grow the buffer. Its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call connection_maximize_write_buffer (or any chain of calls that leads back to it).\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Appears in the mhd_assert expression inside the function. Even though used in an assertion, it is a function call in the source and could (in theory) call back into connection_maximize_write_buffer; its body must be inspected for cycles.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assert macro/implementation can expand to code (or call an assertion handler) that may invoke other functions. To be safe, you must examine the mhd_assert implementation/handler to confirm it cannot trigger a call chain back to connection_maximize_write_buffer.\n\n(Other identifiers in the target function such as NULL or basic types do not affect call-graph cycles and need not be inspected for this MISRA rule.)"
