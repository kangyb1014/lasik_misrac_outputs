  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious recursion was found in the provided fragments. connection_maximize_write_buffer calls only these functions: MHD_pool_get_free, MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace, and MHD_pool_reallocate. The supplied definitions of those functions do not call connection_maximize_write_buffer (nor do they call each other in a way that would form a cycle). There are no function pointers, callbacks, or indirect call sites in the shown code that could lead back to connection_maximize_write_buffer. The mhd_assert macro is a no-op ((void)0) here, so it cannot introduce recursive calls. Standard library calls used (memcpy, memset) do not invoke user functions. Given only the provided code fragments, there is no direct or indirect self-call to investigate, so no suspicious fragments are reported."
